      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing that’s bothered me is that Europeans actually figured out quite quickly from the 16th century on their languages were similar to Hindi. But we have no record classical Greeks or Romans did to Sanskrit, though their languages were much more similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before, they might have not figure this out on their own: contemporaneous H&amp;amp; Mohd lexicographers already organized words as lists of homologs (sometime analogs as they did not fully realize homology). More than one person has indicated that this might have inspired or provided the source material for some one like Jones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
