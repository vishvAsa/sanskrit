  <p>THE NIRUKTA</p>
<h2 id="heading"></h2>
<h3 id="heading-1"></h3>
<p>CHAPTER I</p>
<p>A TRADITIONAL list (of words) has been handed down (to us). It is to be (here) explained. This same list is called Ni-ghantavas.1</p>
<p>From what (root) is (the word) Ni-ghantavas derived? They are words quoted fromthe Vedas (ni-gamaih)? Having been repeatedly gathered together3 fromVedic hymns, they have been handed down by tradition. Aupamanyava holds that, as these are the quoted words of the Vedas, they are called Ni ghantavas on account of their being quoted (t/ii-gamanaat).</p>
<p>Or else (the word Ni-ghantavas) may be (so called) from being fixed only (Vhan), i.e. (a list.in which) they (the words) are fixed together, or collected together ( Vhr).</p>
<p>Now, what (are) the four classes 4 of words ? They are the following : noun and verb ; prepositions and particles.</p>
<p>With reference to this, they6 thus prescribe the definition of noun and verb : the verb has becoming as its fundamental notion,6 nouns have being as their fundamental notion.7</p>
<p>But where both are dominated by becoming,/a becoming arising from a former to a later state is denoted by a verb, as &lsquo;he goes &lsquo;, he cooks *,8 &amp;c.</p>
<p>The embodiment of the whole process from the beginning to the end, which has assumed the character of being, is denoted by a noun, as&rsquo; going &lsquo;,&rsquo; cook ing &lsquo;, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The demonstrative pronoun 1 is a reference to beings, as&rsquo; cow &lsquo;, &rsquo; horse <em>,&rsquo; man &lsquo;,&rsquo; elephant &lsquo;, &amp;c. ; 2 &rsquo; to be &lsquo;, to becoming, as &lsquo;he sits&rsquo;, &lsquo;he sleeps&rsquo;,</em> &lsquo;he goes &lsquo;,&rsquo; he stands &lsquo;, &amp;c.</p>
<p>According to Audumbarayana speech is permanent in the organs only.3</p>
<p>(Here ends the first section.4)</p>
<h3 id="heading-2"></h3>
<p>In that case the fourfold division (of words) will not hold good, nor the grammatical, connexion, nor the mutual reference of sounds which are not produced simultaneously.5 Words are used to designate objects, with regard to everyday affairs in the world, on account of-their comprehensive</p>
<p>ness and minuteness. They, too, are the names of gc as well as of human beings.7 On account of the impermanence of human Uaowledge, the stanza, (directing) the accomplishment of action, is (to be found) in the Veda.8</p>
<p>According to Varsyayani, there are six modifications of becoming : genesis, existence, alteration, growth, decay, and destruction.9 Genesis denotes only the commencement of the first state, but neither affirms nor denies the later. Existence affirms a being that has been produced. Altera tion connotes the modification of elements of a non-decaying being.10 Growth denotes the increase of one&rsquo;s own limbs or of objects which are associated (with one&rsquo;s self), as he grows by means of victory, or he grow.s with his</p>
<p>exponent.&lsquo;7 Cf. Jowett, op. tit., vol. i. p. 333 : Soc. 8 Patafijali, op. cit. i. 1. 1, vol. i, pp. 1 and 5. &rsquo; He often speaks of them ; &rsquo;notably and nobly * Cf. Patanjali, op. cit. i. 1. 1, vol. i, p. 6 ; in the places where he distinguishes the</p>
<p>i. 1, 6, vol. i, p. 104 ; i. 1. 8, vol. i, p. 136 ; different names which gods and men give i. 4. 4, vol. i, p. 356; Bhandarkar, Wilson to the same things&rsquo;, i.e. words are used in Ptulological Lectures, p. 291 ; Jowett, Dialogues giving names to thing* both by gods and of Plato, vol. i, pi. 327, 387, 388 ; Jaimini ; men.</p>
<p>PM. i. 1. 6-23 ; the Vedanta su&rsquo;ras, i. 3. 28 ; This is tantamount io the statement that 4. 28; ii. 1. 4; Kanada, Vaitetika svtras, the Veda is the repository of eternal and ii. 2. 21-37 ; the Sdmkhya-pravacana sutras, v. perfect knowledge.</p>
<p>body. The term decay denotes its antithesis. Destruction denotes the commencement of the later state, but neither affirms nor denies the former.</p>
<p>(Here ends the second section.)</p>
<h3 id="heading-3"></h3>
<p>Hence, other modifications of becoming are only further developments of those (enumerated above), and should be inferred according to the occasion. &lsquo;Unconnected prepositions&rsquo;, says 6akatayana, &lsquo;have no meaning, butonly express a subordinate sense of nouns and verbs.&rsquo; l &rsquo; They have various meanings,&rsquo; says Gargya ;&rsquo; hence, whatever their meaning may be, theyexpress that meaning (which brings about) modification in the sense of the noun and the verb.&rsquo; - The word a is used in the sense of &rsquo; hitherward &lsquo;; 3 pro, and puroi are its antitheses : abhi* &rsquo; towards &rsquo; ; prati is its antithesis : ati and su,&rsquo; apj val&rsquo; ; nir and dur are their antitheses : ni and ava, * downwards &lsquo;; ud is their antithesis : sum,&rsquo; combination &lsquo;; vi and apa are its antitheses : ai&rsquo;.u,&rsquo; similarity&rsquo; and &rsquo; succession&rsquo;: api^&rsquo; contact&rsquo;: upa, 1 accession&rsquo;: pari,&rsquo; being all around&rsquo;: adhi,&rsquo; being above &lsquo;, or&rsquo; supremacy &lsquo;. 5 Thus they express various meanings to which attention should be paid.6 (Here ends the third section.)</p>
<h3 id="heading-4"></h3>
<p>Now the particles occur in various senses,7 both in a comparative sense, in a conjunctive sense,8 and as expletives. Of them, the following four are used in the sense of comparison.8 Iva (has this sense) both in the classical and in the Vedic Sanskrit : thus &rsquo; like Agni &lsquo;,* like Indra &lsquo;, &amp;c. The word iia has the sense of negation in classical, and both (i.e. the sense of negation andcomparison) in Vedic Sanskrit : thus in the passage,&rsquo; They did not recc^i</p>

<p>Jndra as a god V it has the sense of negation.2 The established use is (to place it immediately) before that which it makes negative. In the passage &lsquo;Lake hard drinkers of wine&rsquo;,3 it has the sense of comparison. The estab ii shed use is (to place it immediately) after that with which it compares. The word cid has many meanings. In the sentence &rsquo; Will the teacher kindly explain it ?&rsquo; it is used in the (sense of) respect, [from what root is (the word) dcdrya derived ?]* A-cdrya (teacher) is so called because he imparts traditional precepts (d-cdra) ; 6 or because he systematically arranges (a + y/cl + artha) the various objects (of knowledge), or because he systematic ally develops the intellectual faculty.6 In the expression like curd &lsquo;, it ft used in the sense of comparison ; in &rsquo; bring even the sour gruel &lsquo;, it is Used in the sense of contempt. Kul-md$dk (sour gruels) are so called because they are wasted away (sldaidi) in families (kulesu).1 The word TVu has many meanings. In the sentence &rsquo; therefore he will do it &lsquo;, it is Used in assigning a reason ; in &rsquo; how pray will he do it ?&rsquo; in asking a ques tion, as well as in &rsquo; has he really done it ?&rsquo; It is also used in the sense of</p>
<p>comparison (as follows) :</p>
<p>Ot? thee like the branches of a tree, O widely invoked one! * Of thee like the branches of a tree, O widely invoked one ! &ldquo;Vaydh means branches, (and) is derived from (the root) vi (to move) : they paove in the wind.9 tid-khdh (branches) are so called because they rest in trhe sky (kha-saydh), or (the word) may be derived from (the root) auk (to be able).9 Now a conjunctive particle is that by whose addition separateness of notions is indeed recognized, but not like an enumerative one, i.e. because of a separation by isolation.10 The word ca is used in the sense of &rsquo; aggre gation &lsquo;, and is joined together with both, as&rsquo; I and you, O slayer of Vrtra I&rsquo; &quot; d is used in the same sense, as&rsquo; for gods and for manes V* The word vd is Used in the sense of deliberation, as&rsquo; Ah, shall I put this earth here or there? &gt;K! ^Moreover, it is used in the sense of &rsquo; aggregation&rsquo; (as follows).</p>

<p>&rsquo; Vayu and thee, Mann and thee.&rsquo; l The words aha and hi have the sense of * mutual opposition &lsquo;, and are combined with the former (member) as&rsquo; let this man do this, the other that &lsquo;, and * this man will do this, not that &lsquo;, &amp;c. The letter u is also used in the same sense, (being joined) with the later (member], as &lt; these people tell a lie, those the truth&rsquo;; it is further used as an expletive, as &rsquo;this&rsquo;, &rsquo;that&rsquo;. The word Id has many meanings in (the sentence) &rsquo;therefore he will do it&rsquo;, it (is used) to point out the reason ; in (the sentence)&rsquo; how pray will he do it V to ask a question ; in (the sentence) &lsquo;how can he analyse it ?&rsquo; to (indicate) displeasure. The word kild (is used to express.) superiority of knowledge, as&rsquo; thus truly it happened &lsquo;.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is combined with the two (particles) wt and mi uu in asking a question, as&rsquo; was it not so ?&rsquo; and &rsquo; was it so, pray ?&rsquo; The word iita denotes prohibition, as&rsquo; do not do it &lsquo;, and &rsquo; do not take &lsquo;. The word kfudu alsoj (denotes prohibition), as&rsquo; enough of doing this &lsquo;, and &rsquo; have done with it&rsquo; J f urther, it is used as an expletive, as&rsquo; thus it happened &lsquo;. The word satiwit lias the sense of uncertainty in classical Sanskrit : (in the sentence)&rsquo; was it ever so V it (is used) in an interrogation ; (in the sentence)&rsquo; was it ever so pray ?&rsquo; in an interrogation but not to oneself. The word nunam has the sense of uncertainty in the classical language, both, i.e. the sense of uncertainty and that of an expletive, in Vedic Sanskrit.2</p>

<p>There, it seems, it does not exist, i. e. there is no to-day nor 5 indeed to-morrow. To-day, on this day. Dyuh is a synonym of day (so called) because it is bright ( Vdyut)^ To-morrow, the time that is still expected.

<p>May that rich reward of thine, O Indra ! milk every boon for the singer. Be helpful to the worshippers, do not put us aside, let good fortune (corne) to us ; may we speak loudly in the assembly with heroes.3</p>
<p>May that (reward) of thine milk every boon for the singer. Boon, what is to be chosen. Singer, praiser. Rich reward, i. e. abounding in wealth. The word magham is a synonym of wealth, it is derived from (the root) mamh, meaning to give.4 Daksina (reward) is derived from (thu root) daka, meaning to cause to accomplish : it causes the imperfect to be accomplished. Or else, it may be (so called) from circumambulating. With reference to the quarter, (it means) the quarter natural to the hand, i.e. the right hand.6 Daksinah (right) is derived from (the root) daks, meaning to work strenuously, or from das, meaning to give. IJastah (hand) is derived from (the root) han (to strike): it is quick to strike. Fulfil the desires of the worshippers. Do not pass us over, do not give, leaving us aside. Let good fortune be for us. May we speak loudly in our own assembly. Bhaya (good fortune) is derived from (the root) bhaj (*A&gt; distribute).6 The word brhat is a synonym of &rsquo; great&rsquo;: it is grown all round. Having heroes, or having blessed heroes, A hero, he disperses (vi-irayati) the enemies, or it (w-ra) may be derived from (the root) vf. meaning to go, or from mr (to be powerful).7</p>
<p>The word aim has the sense of totality, or is (used) as an expletive : l Aditya sent them forth.2</p>
<p>Sent them forth, i. e. sent them forth on all sides. And also : From all sidas the wise one has manifested bright rays.B</p>
<p>i. e. The sun has uncovered (them) on all sides. 8u-Wtfah means the raysof the sun, (so called) on account of their brilliant light (su-rocaua). Or else the word sima takes the ablative suffix (-tas) without any meaning,i.e. sliniiah = slmatalt = simd-tah, (which means)* from the boundary &lsquo;. tiwnd means boundary: it forms the seam between two countries. Theword tva, being a pronoun with the sense of &rsquo; opposition &lsquo;, is unaccented.Some hold it to be a synonym of &rsquo; half &lsquo;.</p>

<p>One sits increasing the store of stanzas ; a second chants the yayatrahymn in vakvari measures. One, i. e. Brahma, expounds the science ofbeing ; whilst another metes the measure of the sacrifice.4</p>
<p>With these words, (the stanza) declares the application of the duties ofthe priests. One sits increasing the store of stanzas, i. e. the invoker.A stanza (re) is a means of worshipping (arcana). A second chants theyayatra hymn in Zakvarl- measures, i. e. the chanter. Gdyatram is derivedfrom (the root) yai, meaning to praise. Sakvaryah are stanzas ; it is derived from (the root) &amp;uk (to .be able). It is known : because with thesehe was able to slay Vrtra, that is the characteristic of the &amp;alwari stanzas.5 One, i. e. the Brahma, expounds the science of every being. Brahma is omniscient: he knows everything; Brahma is supererninent from know ledge, Brahma is supereminent all around. One metes the measure of thesacrifice, i. e. the (performing) priest. Adhvar-yuh (priest) = adhvara-yuh,i. e. he directs the sacrifice, he is the leader of the sacrifice, or else, he lovesthe sacrifice. Or (the word is formed) by the addition of (the suffix) yuh(to Vadhi) in the sense of studying.

<p>With these words, the four word-classes, i. e. the noun and the verb,prepositions and particles, are explained in their (respective) order. Withreference to this, 6akatayana holds that nouns are derived from verbs.This, too, is the doctrine of the etymologists.6 &rsquo; Not all,&rsquo; say Gargj&rsquo;a and</p>
<p>only particles, but also prepositions, see verb &rsquo; says the author in the Nirukta. &lsquo;TheAstadln/dyl, i. 4. 56. The technical word noun indeed is derived from the verb&rsquo;,employed by him for particles alone is so say the etymologists, and the son ofavijaya (op. cit. i. 1. 37). Particles are Sakata in grammar. Among the gram ynumm-ated in the gana called cadayah (op. marians, Sakatayana says, &lsquo;The noun is cit. i. 4. 57). The total number of particles derived from the verb&rsquo;; cf. also Breal,collected in the list is 195. This, however, Semantics, p. 107: &lsquo;It comes from the fact docs not include cid and ki mentioned by that the vrb is the essential and the capital Yaska. Of the 195 particles, 22 only are part of our languages, which serves to formexplained in the Nintktu : (1) comparatives, substantives and adjectives&rsquo;; see Moncalm,tro, na, eld, and nu ; (2) conjunctives, ca, a, The Origin of Thought and Speech, p. 74:</p>

<p>some of the grammarians,&rsquo; but only those, the accent and grammatical form of which are regular and which are accompanied by an explanatory radical modification. Those (nouns), such as cow, horse, man, elephant, &amp;c., are conventional 1 (terms, and hence are underivable).&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, if all nouns are derived from verbs, every person who performs a particular action should be called by the same name, i.e. whosoever runs on the road should be called &lsquo;runner&rsquo; (a&amp;va, &lsquo;horse&rsquo;); whatever pricks (like needle, &amp;c.), &lsquo;pricker&rsquo; (trnam, &lsquo;grass&rsquo;). Further, if all nouns are derived from verbs, a substantive should obtain as many names as</p>
<p>the actions with which it is connected; thus a column should also be called &rsquo; beam-supporter &lsquo;, and &rsquo; that which rests in a hole &lsquo;.</p>
<p>(Here ends the twelfth section.)</p>
<h3 id="heading-10"></h3>
<p>Moreover, substantives should be named according to the regular and correct grammatical form of a verb, so that their meanings may be indubitable, e.g. purusa (man) should take the form of pur!.-saya (city dweller) ; aim (horse), of astd (runner) ; triiam (grass), of tardanam (pricker). Further, people indulge in sophistry with regard to current expressions, e. g. they declare that earth (prthivi is (so called) on account of being spread (Vprath)\ but who spread it, and what was the base? Again, JSakatayana derived parts of one word from different verbs, in spite of the meaning being irrelevant, and of the explanatory radical modification being non-existent, e.g. (explaining sat-ya) he derived the later syllable ya from the causal form of (the root) i (to go), and the</p>
<p>former syllable sat from the regular form of (the root) as (to be). Further, it is said that a becoming is preceded by a being, (hence) the designation of a prior (being) from a posterior (becoming) is not tenable ; consequently this (theory of the derivation of nouns from verbs) is not tenable.</p>

<p>As to (the statement) that all those (nouns), the accent and grammatical form of which are regular, and which are accompanied by an explanatory radical modification, are derived, ^we reply that) in that case it is quite evident. As to (the point) that every person whoever performs a par ticular action should be called by the same name, we see that in some cases the performers of the action do obtain a common name, while in others they do not, e. g. a carpenter or ascetic, enlivener, earth-born, Arc.1 With this, the following objection is answered as well. As to (the point) that substantives should be named in such a way that their meanings may be indubitable, (we reply that) there are words (of that character), words of rare occurrence, i.e. single words formed by primary suffixes, as creeper, guest, one having matted locks, a wanderer, wakeful, one whosacrifices with a ladle, &lt;&amp;c. /As to (the objection) that people indulge in sophistry with regard to current expressions, (we reply that) it is with regard to current expressions alone that (etymological) examination is most desirable. With regard to &rsquo; they declare that earth (prthivi) is (so called) on account of being spread ( V&rsquo;jyrath) : but who spread it, and what was the base ?&rsquo; (we reply that) it is indeed broad to look at, even if it is not spread by others. Moreover, in this way all known words, without any exception, can be found fault with. As to (the point) that a certain individual derived parts of one word from different verbs, (we reply that) the person who made such a derivation in spite of the meaning being irrelevant should be blamed; it is the fault of an individual, not of the science (of etymology).</p>
<p>As to (the argument) that the designation of&rsquo; a prior (beiny) from a poster or becoming is not tenable, we see that in some cases prior beinga do obtain their names from posterior becomings, but not in others, as &rsquo; a woodpecker &lsquo;,&rsquo; one having long locks &lsquo;, &amp;c.

<p>hence this science (etymology) is the complement of grammar and a means of accomplishing one&rsquo;s own object. *</p>
<p>&lsquo;If (the object of the science) is to ascertain the meaning of Vedic stanzas, it is useless,&rsquo; says Kautsa,&rsquo; for the Vedic stanzas have no meaning&rsquo;;1 this is to be established&rsquo; by the following arguments :</p>
<p>propositions have their words fixed, their order, too, is immutably fixed.2</p>
<p>Further, the accomplishment of the ritual form is enjoined by the Brahmana,3<br>
as &rsquo; Spread it wide &lsquo;,4 and so he spreads ;&rsquo;<br>

D.), &amp;o With reference to this, it is pointed out that when a root contains a semi-vowel contiguous to a vowel it becomes the origin of two primary bases. There, if an accomplished form is not derivable from one base, one should try to derive it from the other. Even there, some are of rare occurrence, as utih (-/av,</em> protection &lsquo;), mrduk (Vmrad, &lsquo;soft&rsquo;), prthuh (^pjeath, &lsquo;broad&rsquo;), prsatah (V&rsquo;prua, &lsquo;a drop &lsquo;), kunarum ( &lt;/kvan,&rsquo; sounding &lsquo;). Further, Vedic primary nouns are derived from roots of classical Sanskrit, as damundh (devoted to the house), ksetrasddhdh (one who divides the fields), &amp;c. ; and also nouns of classical Sanskrit from Vedic roots, as usnam (werm), ghrtam (clarified butter).3 Further, primary forms alone are employed (in speech) among some people ; secondary forms among others. The verb savati, meaning to go, is used by the Kambojas only. Kambojas (are so called becar.se) they enjoy blankets (kambala), or beautiful things.4 A blanket (kambala) is a desirable object (kamanlya). Its modified form vava is used by the Aryans : ddti, in the sense to cut, is employed by the people of the east, while the people of the north use ddtra (sickle).5 In this manner, one should explain single words.</p>
<p>Now with regard to derivatives and compounds, whether of one or more than one member, one should explain their component parts in their respective order, having first divided (the words) into them.6 Punishable, L e. a person [a person of punishment] deserving punishment, or something to be accomplished by punishment Danda (punishment) is derived from</p>

On account of this 3 analogy (i. e. of being rubbed) it means &rsquo; human armpit &lsquo;, and on account of the analogy of the arms and their root, the word (signifies arm pit) of a horse.</p>

<p>Now, therefore, we shall proceed in order. The word gauh is a synonym of &rsquo; earth &lsquo;, (so called) because it goes very far, or because people go over it (Vgam). Or it may be derived from (the root) go, with the suffix an (go, + au = gau). Moreover, it is a synonym of &rsquo; an animal &lsquo;, from</p>
<p>the same root also. Further, in the latter meaning, there are Vedic passages where primary forms (of gauh) are used in a derivative sense : &rsquo; Mix soma with milk &lsquo;,ci. e. (gauh is used in the sense) of milk. Matsarah means soma; it is derived from (the root) mand meaning to satisfy. Matsarah is a synonym of greed also: it makes man mad a^fter wealth. Payas (milk) is derived from (the root) pa (to drink), or fr6m pydy (to swell).

Amsuh (soma is so calledbecause) no sooner than it goes in, it is agreeable, or it is agreeable for life. Carma (skin) is derived from (the root) car (to move) or (it is so calledbecause) it is cut off (from the body). Moreover (gauh) means skin andphlegm :* Thou art girded round with skin and phlegm, be strong&rsquo; ; 2 this (is said) in praise of a chariot. s Moreover, it means tendon andphlegm :&rsquo; Girt with tendon and phlegm, it flies when discharged&rsquo; ; 3 thisis in praise of an arrow.

<p>&rsquo; Having joints means having brilliance/ says Aupamanyava.7 More over, a ray of the sun illuminates the moon.8 That the illumination of themoon is caused by the sun is to be established by the following : Susumnais the ray of the sun, the moon is the holder.9 This, too, is a Vedic passage.That (ray) is called gauh also.

It is intermediate (a-ntara, i.e. between heaven and earth) ; it is the end of the earth ; or it lies between these two (i.e. heaven and earth), or it is imperishable in the bodies.

From it waters flow up (sam + ud + Vdru), or waters flow towards it (sam + abhi + Vdru), beings take delight in it, or it is a great reservoir of water, or it moistens thoroughly (samVud). Their difference (should be noted). With rfifcrunci1- to this, they relate (the following) legend:3 Devapl and 6antanu, sons ot Rstisena, were two brothers, who belonged to the clan of the Kurus. Sautanu, the younger brother, caused himself to be installed as king. Dovapi retired to practise austerities. From that time the god did not rain for twelve years in the kingdom of 6antanu. The Brahmanas said to him, &rsquo; Thou hast committed (an act of) unrighteousness. Because thou hast caused thyself to be installed as king, having put thy elder brother aside, therefore the god does not rain in thy kingdom/ Then he, i.e. Santanu. sought to invest Devapi with sovereignty.

<p>CHAPTER IV</p>
<p>HOMONYMS</p>
<p>SYNONYMS i have been explained. Now therefore we shall take homonyms 2 in their respective order and (such) Vedic words whose gram matical forms are obscure. They call this (i.e. the list of homonyms) aika padikam,3 (i.e. composed of single words).</p>
<p>Jahd means&rsquo; I have killed &lsquo;.</p>
<p>(Here ends the first section.)</p>
<h3 id="heading-70"></h3>
<p>men, what friend has said, Unprovoked I have killed my friend ? who flies from us 1 *</p>
<p>The word marya is a synonym of man, or it may be a synonym of boundary. [Boundary, it is settled by men.] Boundary is the (line of) division between two bounded places. Methati means to provoke. What innocent man have I ever killed ?5 Who runs away from us because he is afraid of us ?</p>
<p>Nidha, means &rsquo; a net &lsquo;, (so called) because it is laid (on the ground). Pasyd means a collection of snares. Pdsah (snare) is derived from (the root) pas (to fasten), on account of being fastened.</p>
<p>(Here ends the second section.)</p>
<h3 id="heading-71"></h3>
<p>Imploring seers, fond of sacrifices, approached Indra like birds of beauti ful wings. Uncover the encompassed, fill our vision, release us as if we were bound by a net.6</p>
<p>Vayah is the plural of vi (bird). [Of beautiful wings, i.e.] the beauti fully falling rays of the sun approached Indra imploring. Uncover our encompassed vision.7 Caksuh (eye) is derived from (the root) khyd (to know), or caks (to see). Fill, i.e. enlarge or give. Kelease us who are bound with snares as it were.</p>
<p>Ry the region of ribs, hips, and arms.8</p>
<p>and is rightly applied to the list of homo- * x. 73. 11 ; SV. 1. 319. nyms, in which list each word stands by 7 Cf. Roth, op. cit., p. 88. itself, while in the list of synonyms the 8 Frag, of VS. 21. 43 ; TB. iii. 6. 11. 1. words are arranged in groups. However, Durga quotes and explains the stanza in full.4. 4] MEHANA 57</p>
<p>The region of the ribs, i.e. a part (of the body) consisting of joints.1 Parsuh (joint) is derived from (the.root) spry (to touch) : it touches the backpart. Prstkam (back) is derived from (the root) sprit (to touch) : it is touchedby limbs (of the body). A limb is (so called) from being marked, or from beingbent.2 &amp;ronik (hip) is derived from (the root) won, meaning to go forward,i.e. a hip appears to go forward when a person walks. Sitdma means fore- foot (doe). Dos (fore-foot) is derived from (the root) dru (to run).&rsquo; tiitdmameans uterus,&rsquo; says akapuni,&rsquo; it is open.&rsquo;&rsquo; It means liver on account of its dark-red colour,&rsquo; says Taitiki. tiydmam (dark-red) is derived from (the root) tyai (to cause to congeal). Liver is (so called because) it is cut outwith great difficulty.3 &rsquo; (tiitdma) means fat, becausait is white (viti) meat(mdmsam) &lsquo;, says Galava. &amp;iti (white) is derived from (the root) so (to whet). Mdmsam (meat), it is honoured ; 4 it is thoughtr&gt; (delicious) ; orelse, the mind perishes in it. Medas (fat) is derived from (the root) mid (to</p>
<p>grow fat).</p>
<p>(Here etuis the third section.)</p>
<p>O Indra, wielder of the thunderbolt, give us whatever excellent treasure there is. With both hands bring that wealth to us, O treasure-knower.&rsquo; . Whatever [excellent], glorious, and abundant wealth there is, O Indra ; or that which I do not here possess, (i. e. taking me-ha-nd)7 as consisting of three words, that wealth should be given to us, O wielder of the thunderbolt. Adrih (thunderbolt) is (so called because) with it he splits (mountains), or it may be derived from (the root) ad (to eat).</p>
<p>It is well known: they are eaters of soma.8 The word rddhas is a synonym of wealth : with it, they conciliate. Bring that wealth to us, O Lord to whom treasures are known, with both thy hands. Let boththy hands be full.</p>
<p>Damunds? one who is inclined towards kindness, or one who is inclined to charity, or one who is inclined to self-control. Or else the word dwnia is a synonym of home ; (damund*, therefore) may mean,&rsquo; one who is devotedto home &lsquo;. Manas (mind) is derived from (the root) mail (to think). (Here ends the fourth section.)</p>
<h3 id="heading-72"></h3>
<p>Devoted to the house, welcome guest in dwelling-places, approach this sacrifice of ours, O wise onei Having destroyed all assailants, bring to us the treasures of our enemies, O Agni.1</p>
<p>Atithih (guest), one who goes (Vat) to the houses,. or one who goes to the families or houses .of other persons on certain dates 2( */i + tithih). The word durona is a synonym of house : they (homes) are difficult to be satis- fied (dur + Vav,&rsquo; to satisfy &lsquo;), i. e. difficult to be provided for.3 Approach this sacrifice of ours, O wise one ! Having destroyed all assailants, bring to us the treasures of our enemies, i. e. having destroyed the forces of our adver saries, bring to us the treasures or the food from the homes of our enemies.</p>
<p>Musah means a mouse. Musikd (mouse) again is derived from (the root) mus (to steal). Musah is derived from the same root also. (Here ends the fifth section.)</p>

<p>Bricks torment me on every side, like rival wives. O (Indra) of a hundred powers, oppressing cares devour me, thy praiser, as mice the threads. Know, O heaven and earth, of this (state) of mine.4</p>
<p>Bricks, i. e. bricks of the well, torment me on every side, like rival wives. As mice devour the greasy threads. Or (M&amp;na) may mean one&rsquo;s own limbs, i. e. they devour their own limbs ; 6 so oppressing cares, desires torment me, the singer of thy praises, O Lord of a hundred powers. [Know, heaven and</p>
<p>earth, of this (state) of mine.] Realize, O heaven and earth, this (state) of mine. This hymn was revealed to Trita fallen into a well.6 With refer- ence to this, there is an invocation, accompanied with a legend, a stanza, and a gatha.1 Trita, was one most eminent in wisdom. Or else the word</p>
<p>may have been intended as a synonym of number, i. e. ekatah, dvitah, tritah, thus the three were produced.8</p>

<p>fice. Durga. Cf. Roth, op. cit., p. 39. 8 Durga quotes the following passage : It is 7 Cf. Sieg, Sagenstqffe des Sgveda, p. 27. difficult indeed to provide for one&rsquo;s family. $ Cf. Professor Macdonell, J.R.A.S. xxv. 4i. 105. 8 ; x. 32. 2 : cf. Brh.D. 7. 34. 9 viii. 48. 7 ; KS. 17. 19.</p>
<p>O king soma, make our lives long, as the sun does the days in summer.Days are (so called because) they are of different courses,1 or they are bright,2 or they pass away.3</p>
<p>The word fcurutaiia (do), as well as the words kartana (do), hantana(kill), and ydtana (go), have (na) as a redundant addition.4 Jatharam means belly ; (all that is) eaten is held in it, or is deposited in it.</p>

Drink soma for rapture, i.e. for a maddening victory, after food, i. e. after meals.6 Pour down the flood of mead into thy belly. Madhumeans soma, is derived from (the root) mad (to exhilarate), and is comparedwith soma (on account of the analogy of exhilaration). This other (meaningof) madhu (wine) is derived from the same (root) also. Thou art the king of soma-draughts (now, as thou wert) in the former days.</p>

<p>With infused energy, rushing to the attack, shaker, impetuous, great hero and foaming, soma surpasses all plants and trees. All the counter- measures did not deceive Indra.2</p>
<p>One whose anger is roused, and who rushes to attack, [i. e. who is quick to attack, or who attacks while moving,] i.e. soma, or Indra. Dhunih (shaker) is derived from (the root) dhu (to shake). The word simi is a synonym of action, or it may be derived from (the root) am (to exert oneself), or from vak (to be able). The foaming soma : that which remains as residue after soma is strained is called ijisam, i. e. something which is thrown away, hence soma is called r/m, i. e. containing the residue. Further, this is used as an epithet of Indra also : rjisi, the wielder of thunderbolt.3 That portion (i. e. the residue) and the grains belong to his (i. e. Indra&rsquo;s) steeds.4 Grains are (so called because) they are parched in a kiln, or dried on a board.</p>
<p>Let thy steeds devour grain and sniff at the residue.5</p>
<p>This too is a Vedic quotation. (Babdhdm)6 is formed by reduplicating the first syllable and removing the penultimate of (the root) bhas, which means to devour. Soma surpasses all plants and trees. All the counter- measures do not deceive Indra ; i. e. the counter-measures which they adopt against him are of no avail before Indra : they perish before they reach him, i. e. without reaching him at all. Some are of opinion that the stanza is primarily addressed to Indra, while the reference to soma is of secondary character. Others hold that it is primarily addressed to both.</p>

Apeardh (a naiad) is one who moves on water.

In &rsquo; Whatever forbidden food &lsquo;, 4 (apsas signifies) something which is not to be eaten. In &rsquo; Pervading indeed &lsquo;,5 (the word signifies) pervasive.

The section, which enumerates appellations ofdeities, to whom panegyrics are primarily addressed, is called daivatam,i. e. relating to deities. The following is the detailed examination of thesame. A particular stanza is said to belong to a deity, to whom a seeraddresses his panegyrics1 with a particular desire, and from whom hewishes to obtain his object.2 The stanzas, to which reference has just beenmade,8 are of three kinds : (1) indirectly addressed, (2) directly addressed,(3) and self-invocations.

<p>Then was no death, nor indeed immortality.10</p>
<p>In the beginning (of creation) there was darkness, hidden in darkness.11 Further, (in some stanzas) there is apprehension arising from a particular state:</p>
<p>The benevolent god may fly forth to-day and never return.12 I do not know whether I am this or (that).13 And so on. Further, (in some stanzas) there are censure and praise : He alone is guilty who eats alone.14</p>
<p>This dwelling-place of a liberal person is (beautiful) like a lotus-bed.15 Similarly, there is censure of gambling and praise of agriculture in the dice-hymn.16 In this manner and with various intentions, seers have visions of their poetic compositions (mantras).11,</p>

<p>With reference to this, the following is the ascertainment of the deity of those stanzas whose deity is not specified. Such stanzas belong to the same deity to whom tjiat particular sacrifice, or a part of the sacrifice, is offered. Now, elsewhere than the sacrifice, they belong to Prajapati accord ing to the ritualists ; and to Nara^amsa according to the etymologists.1</p>
<p>Or else the deity may be an optional one, or even a group of deities.2 It is, indeed, a very prevalent practice, (in everyday life) in the world, (to dedicate things in common) including what is sacred to gods, to guests, and to the manes.3 As to the view that a stanza belongs to the deity to whomthe sacrifice is offered, (it may be objected) that non-deities are also praised like deities, e. g. the objects beginning with horse and ending with herbs,4 together with the eight pairs.1. But he (the student) should not think that matters relating to gods are adventitious as it were. This is to be clearly seen (by the following) : On account of the supereminence of the deity, a single soul is praised in various ways. Other gods are the individual limbs of a single soul.6 Or else, as people say, seers praise objects according to the multiplicities of their original nature, as well as from its universality. They are produced from each other.7 They are the original forms of each other.8 They are produced from (action (Ax/rma)),9 they are produced from the soul. Soul is even their chariot, their horse, their weapon, their arrows ; soul is indeed the all-in-all of gods.10</p>

<p>well as their appellations are distinct.1 As to the view that (one receives many appellations) on account of the diversity of functions, (it may be remarked) that many men also can do the actions, having divided them among thenwelves. With regard to it, the community of jurisdiction and enjoyment ihould be noted, as for instance, the community of men and gods with regard to earth. Community of enjoyment is seen in the following, i. e. the enjoyment of earth by the cloud, together with air and the sun, and of the other world together with Agni. There everything is like the kingdom of man also.</p>

<h3 id="heading-157"></h3>
<p>Now (we shall discuss) the appearance of the gods. Some say that they are anthropomorphic, for their panegyrics as well as their appellations are like those of sentient beings. Moreover they are praised with reference to anthropomorphic limbs :</p>
<p>Indra, the two arms of the mighty one are noble.-</p>
<p>That (heaven and earth), which thou hast seized, is thy fist, lord of wealth.3</p>
<p>Moreover (they are praised) as associated with anthropomorphic objects : O Indra, come with thy team of two bay steeds.4 A beautiful wife and delightful things are in thy house.5 Moreover (they are praised) with regard to anthropomorphic actions : Indra, eat and drink the (soma) placed before (thee).6</p>
<p>Hear our call, O God that hast listening ears.7</p>
<p>(Here ends the sixth section.)</p>
<h3 id="heading-158"></h3>
<p>Others say that they are not anthropomorphic, because whatever is seen of them is unanthropomorphic, as for instance, fire, nir, the sun, earth, the moon, &amp;c. As to the view that their panegyrics are like those of sentient beings, (we reply) that inanimate objects, beginning from dice and ending with herbs,8 are likewise praised. As to the view that they are praised with reference to anthropomorphic limbs, (we reply) that this (treatment) is accorded to inanimate objects also :</p>
<p>They shout with their green mouths.9 This is a panegyric of stones. As to the view that (they are praised) as associated with anthropo</p>

<p>This is a panegyric of a river. As to the view that (they are praised) with regard to anthropomorphic actions, (we reply) that it is exactly the same (in the case of inanimate objects) :</p>
<p>Even before the sacriticer, they taste the delicious oblations.2 This too is a panegyric of stones. Or else they may be both anthropomorphic and unanthropomorphic. Or else (the unanthropomorphic appearance) of the gods, who are really anthropomorphic,15 is their counterself in the form of action. (Karma) as sacrifice is that of a sacrificer. This is the well-con- sidered opinion of those who are well versed in legendary lore. (Here eiuts tie, seventh section.)</p>
<p>It has been said before that there are three deities only. Now we shall explain their shares and companions. Now the following are the shares of Agni : this world, the morning libation, spring, the Gdyinrl metre, the triple hymn, the ratlantaram chant, and the group of gods who are enumerated in the first place.4</p>
<p>Ayitayl (wife of Agni), Prill vl (earth), and Hcl (praise) are the women. Now its function is to carry oblations and to invoke the gods. And all that which relates to vision is the function of Agni also. Now the gods with whom Agni is jointly praised are (1) Indra. (2) Soma, (3) Vnruna, (4) Parjanya, and (5) the Rtavas. There is a joint oblation offered to, but no joint panegyric addressed to, Agni and Visnu in the ten books (of the</p>
<p>R&lt;jveda)J&rsquo; Moreover there is a joint oblation offered to, but no joint panegyric addressed to. Agni and Pusan. With regard to this, the following stanza is cited (in order to show their) separate praise.</p>
<p>(Here ends ike eighth section.)</p>
<p>May Pu.san, the wise, the guardian of the universe, whose cattle are never lost, cause thee to move forthwith from this world. May he hand thee over to these manes, and (may) Agni (entrust) thee to the benevolent</p>

<p>of the universe, i.e. he, the sun, is indeed the guardian of all created beings, forthwith cause thee to move from this world. The third verse, &lsquo;May he hand thee over to the manes&rsquo;, is doubtful. According to some, it refers to Pusan, (mentioned) in the preceding hemistich ; according to others this extols Agni, (mentioned) subsequently. (May) Agni (entrust) thee to the benevolent gods.</p>
<p>Suvidatram means wealth : it may be derived from (the root) vid (to find) with one preposition (su) or from da (to give) with two prepositions</p>
<p>(su and vi).</p>
<p>(Here ends the nintk section.)</p>
<h3 id="heading-159"></h3>
<p>Now the following are the shares of Indra : the atmosphere, the midday libation, the summer, the trfytubh metre, the fifteenfold hymn, the great chant,1 and the gods who are enumerated in the middle place as well as the women.- Now his function is to release the waters and to slay Vrtra. And all action that relates to strength is Indra&rsquo;s function also. 5 Now the gods with whom Indra is jointly praised are Agni, Soma, Varuna, Pusan, Brhaspati, Brahmanaspati, Parvata, Kutsa, Visnu, Vayu. Moreover, Mitra is jointly praised with Varuna ; Soma with Pusan and Rudra ; Pusan with Vayu ; and Parjanya with Vata.</p>

<h3 id="heading-160"></h3>
<p>Now the following are the shares of Aditya : that world (i. e. heaven), the third libation, the rainy season, the jagaM metre, the seventeenfold hymn, the Vairu&rsquo;pa chant, and the gods enumerated in the highest place as well as the women.4 Now his function is to draw out and hold the juices with his rays. All that relates to greatness5 is Aditya&rsquo;s function also. He is jointly praised with Candramas, Vayu, and Samvatsara. One should frame the remaining portions of seasons, metres, hymns, &amp;c. in accordance with the distribution of the places (already mentioned). Autumn, the anustiM metre, the twenty fold hymn, the Vairaja chant are terrestrial. Winter, the pdnkti metre, the twenty-sevenfold hymn, the &amp;dkvara 7 chant are atmospheric. The dewy season, the aticcJtandas metres, the thirty-threefold hymn, the Raivata chant are celestial.8</p>
<p>(Here ends the eleventh section.)</p>

<p>Stanzas are (so called) from thinking, metres from covering, [hymn from praising]. Yajus is derived from (the root) yaj (to sacrifice). Samu, is (so called because) it is measured out by the stanza, or it may be derived from (the root) as (to throw).&rsquo; He thought it equal to the stanza,&rsquo; say they who are well versed in Vedic metres.</p>
<p>Gdyatrll is derived from (the root) gai, meaning to praise, or from gam with tri by metathesis, i. e. three-coursed.</p>
<p>There is a Brahmana passage :&rsquo; It fell out of (Brahma&rsquo;s) mouth while he was singing&rsquo;. Usnih is (so called because) it has stepped out, or it may be derived from (the root) sulk, meaning to shine. Or comparatively speaking, (it is so called) as if furnished with a head-dress. Ustilsa (head</p>
<p>dress) is derived from (the root) snui (to wrap round). Kakubh is (so called because) it has an elevation. Kakubh and kubja (crooked) are derived from (the root) kuj (to be crooked) or ul&gt;j (to press down). Amistiibh is (so called) from praising after. There is a Brahmana passage : It follows the Gdyatri, which consists of three verses only, (with its fourth verse of praise). BrJtAttl - is (so called) from its great growth.</p>
<p>PaiJdi* is a stanza of five verses. The second member of the word Tri$t\ibh4 is derived from (the root) stubh (to praise). But what does the tri mean ? (It means swiftest), i. e. it is the swiftest metre. Or (it is so called because) it praises the threefold thunderbolt. It is known : that it praised thrice, that is the characteristic of the Tristubh.5</p>

<p>Jagatl is a metre gone farthest, or it has the gait of an aquatic animal* There is a Brahmana passage :&rsquo; The creator emitted it when he was dis- inclined to do anything&rsquo;.7 Virdt 8 is (so called) from excelling, or from being at variance with others, or from extension ; from excelling, because the syllables are complete ; from being at variance, because the (number of) syllables varies ; from extension, because the (number of) syllables is very</p>

<p>With these words, these deities are dealt with. Those to whom the hymns are addressed, oblations are offered, and stanzas are addressed are by far the most numerous. Some are incidentally mentioned.3 Moreover, one offers oblations to gods, having announced (lit. joined together) them</p>
<p>with their characteristic appellations, as to Indra, the destroyer of Vrtra, [to Indra, who excels Vrtra], to Indra, the deliverer from distress, and so on. Some make a list of these also, but they are too numerous to be collected together in a list. I enlist that appellation only which has</p>
<p>become a conventional epithet and with reference to which chief praise is addressed (to the deity). Moreover, a seer praises deities with regard to their activities, as (Indra), the Vrtra-slayer, or the city-destroyer, and so on. Some make a list of these also, but they are too numerous to be collected together in a list. These (epithets) are mere indications of (a particular aspect of the proper) appellations, just as&rsquo; give food to a Br&amp;hmana who is hungry, or unguents to one who has taken a bath, or water to one who is thirsty &lsquo;. 4 (Here ends the thirteenth section,.)</p>

<p>Now, therefore, we shall take up the deities in their respective order. We shall first explain Agni,5 whose sphere is the earth. From what root is Agni derived ? He is the foremost leader,6 he is led foremost in sacrifices, he makes everything, to which it inclines, a part of himself. &rsquo; He is a drying agent &lsquo;, says Sthaulas^hlvi,&rsquo; it does not make wet, it does not moisten.&rsquo; &lsquo;It is derived from three verbs&rsquo;, says Sakapuni, &lsquo;from</p>
<p>going, from shining or burning, and from leading.&rsquo; He, indeed, takes the letter a from the root i (to go), the letter ft from the root atij (to shine), or dah (to burn), with the root ni (to lead) as the last member. The follow- ing stanza is addressed to him.</p>

<p>identical with the third Kkawfa of the B Cf. Professor Macdonell, KKc Ifytto&amp;yy, Dojrota BrMmatia. PP- 88-100.</p>
<p>I praise Agni, placed foremost, the god, the priest</p>
<p>Of the sacrifice ; the sacrifice!- and the best bestower of gifts.1 I praise Agni, I beseech Agni. The root -Id means to solicit, or to worship. Purohita (placed foremost) and yajua (sacrifice) have been ex plained. Dew (god) is (so called) from making gifts (Vda) or from being brilliant (Vdip), from being radiant (<em>/dyut), or because his sphere is heaven. He who is called god (deva) is also called deity (devata). Sacrifice!</em>, invoker. (Hotd) (sacrificer) is derived from (the root) ku (to sacrifice), says Aurnav&amp;bnft. &rsquo; The best bestower of gifts &lsquo;, the most liberal giver of delightful riches. The following additional stanza is addressed to him also.</p>
<p>(Here ends the fifteenth section.)</p>
<h3 id="heading-163"></h3>
<p>Agni should be solicited by seers, old as well as new ; he shall bring the gods here.2</p>
<p>May Agni, who should be solicited, [should be worshipped], by older seers as well as by us, who are the younger ones, bring the gods to this place. He (the student) should not think that Agni refers to this (terres trial fire) only. The two highef luminaries (lightning and the sun) are called Agni also. With reference to this (the following stanza refers to) the Agni of the middle region.</p>

<p>Let them 4 bend down towards it like maidens who have the sameminds.6 Samanam (of the same mind) is (so called) from breathing together or from thinking together. (Let them bend towards) AgniG like beautiful smiling maidens, is a simile. Streams of clarified butter, i. e. of water. Let them be united with fuel. The root nas means to obtain or to bend. Enjoying them, the god who has all created beings as his property is gratified. The root her means to desire to obtain, i. e. he desires to obtain them again and again.</p>

<p>They call Agni Indra, Mitra, and Varuna ; (they) also (say) that he is the divine Garutman of beautiful wings. The sages speak of him who is one in various ways ; they call him Agni, Yama, MatarisVan.&ldquo;4</p>
<p>The wise speak cf this very Agni, [and] the great self, in various ways, as Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni, and the divine Garutman. Divine, born in heaven. Garutman is (so called because) he is praised, or whose soul is mighty, or whose soul is great. He to whom the hymn is addressed and the oblation is offered, is this very (terrestrial) Agni.

<p>From what root is JdU&rsquo;veddh derived ?c</p>
<p>He knows all created beings, or he is known to all created beings, or else he pervades every created being, or he has all created beings as his property or wealth, or he has all created beings as his knowledge, i. e. dis- cernment. There is a Brahmana passage : that because, as soon as he was born, he found the cattle, that is the characteristic of Jatavedas.

<p>of sacrifice. The meaning is that he will cause soma to be offered. He takes us, i. e. the assembly, across all obstacles, all difficult places. Agni carries us across troubles like a river, a very deep and broad stream, by</p>
<p>a boat, i. e. he helps us to overcome difficulties as if he were to take us across a river by means of a boat. The following additional stanza is addressed to him also.)* Do ye impel Jatavedas, the strong horse, to sit on this our grass.2</p>
<p>With your actions impel Jatavedas, who pervades everywhere. Or else it may be a simile, i. e. Jatavedas, who is like a horse, may he sit on this our grass. In the ten books (of the Ryvedv) there is but a single hymn, containing three stanzas in the Gayatri metre, addressed to Jatavedas. But whatever is addressed to Agni, is associated with Jatavedas too./ He(the student) should not think that this refers to (terrestrial) Agni alone ; even these two upper lights are called Jatavedas also.</p>
<p>With reference to this, (the following stanza refers to) the Agni of the middle region.</p>
<p>Let them procure like maidens of the same mind.3</p>
<p>This we have already explained.4 Now (the following stanza refers to) the sun.</p>
<p>They uplift him, Jatavedas.5 We shall explain this later on.6 He, to whom the hymn is addressed and the oblation is offered, is this very (terrestrial) Agni Jatavedas. These two upper luminaries receive (praise and oblations) under this appellation incidentally only.7</p>

<p>Born from this world, he surveys the entire universe. VaisVanara stretches together with the sun. May we be in the benevolent will of Vaisvanara, i. e. of him who is the king and the place of refuge of all created beings. But who is Vaisvanara ? The preceptors say,&rsquo; This is the atmospheric fire, for the seer praises him with regard to the phenomenon of rain &lsquo;.</p>
<p>(Here ends the twenty-second section.)</p>
<h3 id="heading-169"></h3>
<p>I will proclaim the greatness of the bull. Supplicating men attend upon him who is the slayer of Vrtra. The VaiSvanara Agni killed the demon, shook the waters, and shattered 6ambara.2</p>
<p>I will speak forth the greatness, i.e. the pre-eminence of the bull, i. e. the sprinkler of the waters. Supplicating men, i. e. whose request is to be granted, and who are desirous of rain, attend upon, i. e. serve him, who is the slayer of Vrtra, i. e. the cloud. Dasyu (demon) is derived from (the root) das, meaning to lay waste : in him the juices are wasted, or he causes works to be laid waste.3 The VaiSvanara Agni slew him, shook the waters, and shattered 6ambara, i. e. the cloud.</p>
<p>Moreover, the oblation assigned to VaisVanara is distributed in twelve potsherds,6 for his function is twelvefold. Moreover, there is a Brahmana</p>
<p>passage: That Aditya verily is Agni Vaisvanara.1 Further, the invoca tions in the liturgy are addressed to VaisVanara, the sun, as : &rsquo; Whoillumines heaven and earth&rsquo;.2</p>
<p>He indeed illuminates both heaven and earth. Further, the chdiulomikahymn 3 is addressed to VaisVanara, the sun : He shone present in heaven.</p>
<p>He, indeed, shone present in heaven. Further, the havispantlya*(i. e. libation to be drunk) hymn is addressed to VaisVanara, the sun. 4 This very (i. e. terrestrial) fire is VaisVanara,&rsquo; says 6akapuni.5 Thesetwo upper lights are called VaisVanara also. This (terrestrial) tire is calledVaigvanara, because it is engendered from them (i.e. the upper lights). But how is it engendered from them ? Where the lightning fire strikesa place of shelter,6 it retains the characteristics of the atmospheric fire, i. e. flashing in waters and becoming extinguished in solid bodies, as long as(that object) is not seized upon. But as soon as it is seized upon, this very(terrestrial) fire is produced, which becomes extinguished in water, andblazes in solid bodies.</p>
<p>Now (the following is the process of its production) from the sun.The sun having first revolved towards the northern hemisphere, a personholds a polished (piece of) white copper, or crystal, focusing the sun-raysin a place where there is some dry cow-dung, without touching it : it blazesforth, and this very (terrestrial) fire is produced.7 Moreover, the seer hassaid:</p>
<p>Vais*vanara stretches with the sun.8</p>
<p>But the sun itself cannot stretch together with his own self. Apar ticular thing stretches together with something different only. Onekindles this fire from this world, the rays of that one become manifest fromthe other world.

<p>The bay steeds having beautiful wings clad in waters fly up their dark course to heaven. They turned round from the seat of waters, and lo ! the earth is made wet with clarified butter.2</p>
<p>The dark egression, i.e. the njght of the sun. Bay steeds having beautiful wings are the draught-animals, i. e. the rays of the sun.3 When from heaven, from the common dwelling-place of waters, i. e. the sun, they turn down towards the earth, the latter is made wet with clarified butter, i.e. water. The word yhrta is a synonym of water; it is derived from (the root) ghr, meaning to besprinkle. Moreover, there is a Brahmana passage: Agni verily sends forth rain from this world. Having become [indeed] the space-coverer (i.e. cloud) in the atmosphere, it. rains; the Maruts conduct the emitted rain. When, indeed, the sun turns round fire with his rays, then it rains.4 As to (the view) that after ascension the series of descending is designed, (we reply) that this takes place by the injunction of the sacred texts. As to (the view) that the oblation assigned to Vaisvanara is distributed in twelve potsherds, (we reply) that the num ber of potsherds has no (reference to) the explanation (of the function), for the oblation 5 assigned to the sun is distributed in one, as well as in five potsherds. As to the Brahmank quotation, (we reply) that the Brahmanas, indeed, speak of many divisions, as : the earth is Vaisvanara, the year is Vaisvanara, Brahmana is VaiSvanara,6 and so on.</p>
<p>As to (the view) that invocations in the liturgy are addressed to VaisVanara, the sun, (we reply) that the liturgy is addressed to this very (terrestrial) fire.&rsquo; Who shone for the tribes of men.&rsquo; 7 As to (the view) that</p>

<p>FROM what root is dravinodah (giver of wealth) derived ? Dravinammeans wealth (so called) because people run ( */dru) towards it, or strength (so called) because people run by means of it; dravinodah (therefore) means the giver of wealth or strength.2 The following stanza is addressed to him.</p>

<p>But who is this giver of wealth ?&rsquo; It is Indra &lsquo;, says Kraustuki ;&rsquo; he is the most liberal giver of strength and wealth,1 and all deeds relating to strength belong to him/ The seer also says :</p>
<p>I think he is indeed born of energetic strength.2</p>
<p>Moreover a seer calls Agni a descendant of the giver of wealth, because he is born from him.3</p>
<p>Who generated fire between two stones.4 This too is a Vedic</p>
<p>quotation.</p>
<p>Further, there are expressions relating to the &lsquo;giver of wealth&rsquo; in (stanzas used in) sacrifices and offered to the seasons. &lsquo;Indra&rsquo;s drink&rsquo;, again, is the (name) of their vessel. Further, he is praised with reference to the drinking of soma. Further, a seer says : May the giver of wealth</p>

<p>&rsquo; This very (i. e. terrestrial) Agni is called &quot; giver of wealth &ldquo;,&rsquo; says akapuni. The expressions referring to &rsquo; the giver of wealth &rsquo; are found in hymns addressed to Agni only.6</p>
<p>Gods supported Agni, giver of wealth.7 This too is a Vedic quotation. As to (the view) that Indra is the most liberal giver of strength and wealth, (we reply) that all gods possess supernatural power. As to (the quotation) &rsquo; I think he is indeed born of energetic strength &lsquo;,8 (we reply) that this very (i. e. terrestrial) tire is produced when churned with energetic strength ;</p>

<p>This son of seers is the overlord.11 This too is a Vedic quotation. As to (the view) that &rsquo; Indra&rsquo;s drink&rsquo; is the name of their drinking-cup, (we reply) that it is a mere apportionment,12 as all the cups used in drinking soma are called &rsquo; belonging to Vayu &lsquo;.

Jagurih (leading) is derived from the intensive form of the verb gam (to go). (Far off), i. e. winding with curves. What was the errand with regard to us ? what night ? Paritakmya, means night, (so called) because takma surrounds it on both sides. Takma is a synonym of heat, (so called) because it goes away ( Vtak). How hast thou crossed the waters of the Rasa ? Rasa, a river, is derived from (the verb) ras, meaning to make a sound. Or else how (hast thou crossed) those roaring waters ?
