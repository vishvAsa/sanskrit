Preface
In her Foreword to Tatyana Elizarenkova’s fascinating work
Language and Style of the Vedic R̥ṣis \(SUNY Press, 1993\), Wendy Doniger
makes an interesting distinction between “the modern, trendy, obscure”
disciplines such as semiotics, and “the ancient, dusty, arcane discipline of
Vedic philology.” By this yardstick, the present work proudly fits within the
latter type. This work simultaneously continues and criticizes the work of
the great American Sanskritist, W.D. Whitney, who published the first edition
of this text with the title Atharvaveda-Prātiśākhya in 1862, and Surya Kanta,
who produced the magnificent edition of a different Atharva-Prātiśākhya in
1939. It is the result of my own research that spans more than two decades.
During this period, many trendy varieties of linguistics came to pass.
Fortunately perhaps, I have been more interested in the history of both
modern and ancient linguistic theory, than in becoming an ardent follower of
any one of the transient theories. I have used my knowledge of modern
phonetics and phonology to elucidate the ancient theories of the Prātiśākhyas
so that they can be made comprehensible to a modern reader. However, my
approach has been primarily textual and historical, rather than theoretical.
It was in 1974 while reading the Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā with my
student James Bare at the University of Michigan that I detected a number of
faulty readings and made a note of possible emendations. That very same
year, during a visit to Pune in search of manuscripts, I found half a dozen
manuscripts of this text at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute and the
Vaidika Samshodhana Mandala. To my delight, these manuscripts supported
many of my emendations to Whitney’s text. This led me to think about
preparing a critical edition of this text.
The critical edition, however, could not be properly undertaken
without gaining access to many more manuscripts of this text which were
known to exist in different libraries around the world. In the year 1979,
several more manuscripts became available to me. These came from the
Staatsbibliothek Prussischer Kulturbesitz of Berlin, the library of the
University of TÜbingen, the Asiatic Society of Calcutta, and the Scindia
Oriental Institute of Ujjain. In 1980, I found a manuscript in Banaras at the
home of an Atharvaveda reciter, Pandit Narayan Shastri Ratate. Twelve
years later, several important manuscripts were obtained in 1992 from the

library of the Sampurnananda Sanskrit University in Banaras. In the summer
of 1995, I found three rare manuscripts of the Kramapāṭha and the Jaṭāpāṭha
of the Śaunakīya Atharvaveda at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute,
Pune, which significantly assisted my interpretation of this text. In the midst
of my other research, my work on this project continued on and off from
1974. I thank all the institutions that supported my research during this long
period:
1974, U.S. Department of Education, through the Center for South
and Southeast Asian Studies, University of Michigan.
1976, Rackham Graduate School Faculty Research Grant, University
of Michigan.
1979-80, Rackham Graduate School Faculty Research Grant,
University of Michigan.
1990, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, Faculty Research
Grant, University of Michigan.
1992-93, American Institute of Indian Studies, the National
Endowment for the Humanities, and the Office of the Vice-
President for Research, the University of Michigan.
Numerous people have helped me throughout this long period in
many different ways. I would like to specifically thank the following
individuals who helped me in acquiring manuscripts:
Dr. Dieter George and Dr. Hartmut-Ortwin Feistel, 
Staatsbibliothek Prussischer Kulturbesitz in Berlin.
Dr. N.B. Marathe of the Central Reference Library, Calcutta, 
\(currently at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 
Pune\).
Dr. Amalendu De, the Asiatic Society, Calcutta.
Dr. K. Gruessner, Library of the University of TÜbingen.
Dr. V. Venkatachalam, Director, Scindia Oriental Institute, Ujjain.
Pandit Narayan Shastri Ratate, Durga Ghat, Banaras.
Dr. B.N. Misra, Librarian, Sampurnananda Sanskrit University, 
Banaras.
Dr. T.N. Dharmadhikari, Vaidika Samshodhana Mandala, Pune.
Dr. R.N. Dandekar, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune.

A major part of this work was carried out at the Bhandarkar Oriental
Research Institute during my various research visits, but most intensively
during 1992-93, and the summer of 1995. Besides the excellent manuscript
collection of this institute, my daily conversations with Dr. R.N. Dandekar,
Dr. M.A. Mehendale, Dr. A.M. Ghatage, and Dr. G.B. Palsule were most
exciting. Many knotty problems of this text and its interpretation were solved
during our afternoon tea. I thank all these scholars, and especially Dr.
Dandekar, who introduced me to the mysteries of the Śaunakīya Atharvaveda
at the University of Poona, when I was studying for my Master’s degree in
Sanskrit in the years 1966-68. In the U.S., my most sincere thanks go to
Professor George Cardona. In spite of his own heavy commitments, Cardona
has gone through this entire work and made numerous suggestions for
improvement. At home in Ann Arbor, my colleague Professor John C.
Catford, Professor \(Emeritus\) of Phonetics, University of Michigan, took a
keen interest in this work. He read my translations with great interest and
made suggestions to make them comprehensible to non-Sanskritist linguists.
Finally I wish to thank my wife Shubhangi and my daughters Madhushree
and Manjushree who have tolerated my eccentricities while I was lost in deep
communication with my manuscripts and my computer.
I dedicate this work to my two lovely daughters, Madhushree and
Manjushree, who have brought immense joy to me and my wife. The book is
typeset using Nagari and Roman diacritics fonts which I developed over the
past several years. These fonts are named after my daughters. The Nagari
font is titled Madhushree and the Roman diacritics font is titled Manjushree.
During the long time it has taken to finish this project, I have learned a great
deal about the history of the grammatical traditions in ancient India, and I
hope that this book will spur further interest in this ‘ancient, dusty, and
arcane,’ but highly important, branch of Vedic philology. While much of this
work criticizes the views of Whitney and Surya Kanta, I wish to express my
great indebtedness to these two predecessors. The more I read and analyzed
their contributions, the more respect I have developed for their wisdom and
industry.

INTRODUCTION
1. Critical Edition of the Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā
1.1. William Dwight Whitney, the great American Sanskritist, pub-
lished the first edition of the Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā in the journal of the
American Oriental Society in 1862. This edition was based exclusively on a
single manuscript of this text which Whitney found in Berlin. Whitney fully
realized that this manuscript \(= Chambers 143\) was in bad shape, and
attempted to find more manuscripts in European and Indian libraries. Having
failed in his search for more manuscripts, and having realized the importance of
this text for the study of the Śaunakīya-Atharvaveda, which he and Roth had
edited and published from Berlin in 1856, Whitney decided to edit and publish
this text. In the introduction to his edition, Whitney makes the following
comments about his lone manuscript source \(Whitney 1862: iv\):
Most unfortunately, considering the extreme rarity of the work,
the manuscript is a very poor one. Not only is it everywhere
excessively incorrect, often beyond the possibility of successful
emendation; it is also defective, exhibiting lacunae at several
points. Some may be of opinion, then, that the publication of
the Prātiśākhya upon its authority alone is premature, and
should not have been undertaken.
Emphasizing the “faintness of the hope that additional manuscripts
would later be obtainable” \(Whitney 1862: iv\) and “the peculiar interest of this
class of works,” \(ibid.\) Whitney published his excellent edition in 1862, with a
translation and notes based on the commentary in the Berlin manuscript. From
this lone poor manuscript, Whitney could only salvage the text of the
Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā. He extensively used and cited the commentary in
that manuscript, though due to the poor condition of the manuscript, he did not
publish the complete text of this commentary. Considering the odds against
Whitney, one must admit that he produced a masterly edition which has been
widely used by scholars since its publication.
1.2. The Berlin manuscript did not call the text by the title Atharva-
veda Prātiśākhya. However, Whitney argued \(1862: iii\):

2 INTRODUCTION
The treatise was first brought to light, and its character deter-
mined, by Roth. It was recognized by him as being what is
indicated by our title, a Prātiśākhya to a text of the Atharvaveda.
That it has any inherent right to be called the Prātiśākhya to the
Atharvaveda is not, of course, claimed for it; but, considering
the extreme improbability that any other like phonetic treatise,
belonging to any other schools of that Veda, will ever be
brought to light, the title of Atharvaveda Prātiśākhya finds a
sufficient justification in its convenience, and in its analogy with
the names given to the other kindred treatises by their respective
editors.
Whitney’s text has been widely used under the name of the Atharva-
veda-Prātiśākhya. The above paragraph from Whitney needs to be read care-
fully, and one should note that he nowhere asserted that this text is the
Prātiśākhya of the Atharva-Veda, an accusation hurled at him unjustly by
Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 31\): “Whitney turns an APr into the
APr.” Whitney never made such a claim. 
Whitney’s modest claim that the Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā belongs to
the class of Prātiśākhyas was indeed not outlandish. Support for the same
conclusion comes from an important source. Uvaṭa in his introductory
comments on the RPR quotes CA \(1.1.2-3: एवमिहेति च, विभाषाप्राप्तं सामान्ये\) and
introduces it as \(M.D. Shastri’s edition, Vol. II, p. 23\): तथा चाथर्वणप्रातिशाख्ये
‘so it is said in the Prātiśākhya of the Atharvaveda.’ The second likely tradi-
tional source of information is the commentary Chāyā by Vaidyanātha Pāya-
guṇḍe on Nāgeśabhaṭṭa’s Uddyota. In his MB on P.1.1.10 \(नाज्झलौ\), Patañjali
quotes a sequence of rules from some text, and they look very similar to CA
\(1.1.29-32\). Ramadeva Tripathi \(1977: 141\) ascribes to Pāyaguṇḍe’s Chāyā a
remark that these rules are cited from the Śaunaka Prātiśākhya. I have not been
able to trace this remark to citations of Chāyā in the Nirnaya Sagara edition of
the MB. However, I find a remark स्पृष्टमित्यादीनि चत्वारि शौनकप्रातिशाख्यसूत्राणि
बोध्यानि, Nirnaya Sagara Edition of the MB, Vol.I., Bombay, 1917, edited by
Pt. Shivadatta Kuddala, p. 228. This comment is followed by the abbreviation
dā. This abbreviation indicates that the comment belongs to the editor, rather
than to Vaidyanātha’s Chāyā. It is possible that the learned editor was familiar
with Whitney’s edition of the CA, which called it the Atharva-Veda-
Prātiśākhya. In any case, one can at least say that a traditional Pandit did not
see anything wrong in calling this text a Śaunaka Prātiśākhya. 

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 3
This is also supported by the Ātharvaṇa-Pariśiṣṭa \(= Atharva-Vidhāna\)
included in the Śikṣāsaṃgraha \(p. 479\). It refers to a Śaunakīya-Prātiśākhya
and to the Māṇḍūkī-Śikṣā :
प्रातिशाख्यं शौनकीयं स्वरवर्णविभागजम् ॥ ५cd ॥
शिक्षा प्रकल्पिता सम्यङ्मण्डूकेन महर्षिणा ।
शिष्याणामुपदेशार्थं सम्यगुच्चारणाय वै ॥ ६ ॥
From the description of the Śaunakīya-Prātiśākhya as svara-varṇa-
vibhāgajam, one can be certain that the Pariśiṣṭa is referring to the CA.
1.3. The subsequent scholarship on the Atharvaveda has happily dis-
proved Whitney’s earlier bleak expectations. In 1880, Whitney himself pub-
lished “Collation of the Second Manuscript of the Atharvaveda Prātiśākhya” in
the tenth volume of the Journal of the American Oriental Society. Albrecht
Weber was instrumental in drawing Whitney’s attention to this manuscript
which was purchased by Georg BÜhler for the Government of Bombay. This
second manuscript collated by Whitney is now deposited at the Bhandarkar
Oriental Research Institute \(\# 11/1870-71\). Whitney duly notes that this
second manuscript gives the title of the work simply as Caturādhyāyikā
throughout. It also calls itself Caturādhyāyī-Vyākaraṇa in some places.
Whitney, however, still insists on calling this text Atharvaveda-Prātiśākhya.
1.4. In 1923, Vishva Bandhu Shastri published a different treatise
from Lahore under the name Atharva-Prātiśākhya. This edition is based on six
different manuscripts. Referring to Whitney’s earlier statements, Vishva
Bandhu Shastri pointed out that many new manuscripts of the Śaunakīyā
Caturādhyāyikā had also been found and preserved and that “a new and revised
edition of the Caturādhyāyikā has thus become a matter of necessity” \(Atharva-
Prātiśākhya, edited by V. B. Shastri, p. 12\). However, Vishva Bandhu Shastri
seems to have been unaware of Whitney’s collation of the second manuscript,
and he did not undertake the task of preparing this new revised edition of the
Caturādhyāyikā.
In 1937, Surya Kanta Shastri prepared a critical edition of this other
Atharvaveda-Prātiśākhya for his Ph.D. at Oxford, and this text has been pub-
lished from Lahore in 1939. This text includes Vishva Bandhu’s text as one of
the versions, and is obviously different from the Caturādhyāyikā. In fact,
several manuscripts which contain this Atharvaveda-Prātiśākhya also contain
the text of the Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā. Thus, the labors of Vishva Bandhu
Shastri and Surya Kanta Shastri have conclusively proved the existence of two
separate texts, i.e. the Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā and Atharvaveda-Prātiśākhya,

4 INTRODUCTION
and that the text that Whitney then called the Atharvaveda-Prātiśākhya must
now be called simply the Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā.
1.5. The existence of other manuscripts of Caturādhyāyikā became
known to the world of scholarship since Weber noticed in 1863 a second
manuscript in the Literarisches Central-Blatt \(No. 29\). This was just one year
after Whitney published his edition. Later, more manuscripts of the
Caturādhyāyikā were noticed by Vishva Bandhu Shastri and Surya Kanta
Shastri. Additionally, in 1937, the curator of the Scindia Oriental Institute,
Ujjain, Sadashiv L. Katre, discovered a manuscript titled Kautsa-Vyākaraṇa,
which is identical with the Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā. He published a detailed
notice of this manuscript and its comparison with Whitney’s text \(Katre 1938-
39\). However, Katre does not show any awareness of the existence of the
other manuscripts of the Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā which were noticed by
Vishva Bandhu Shastri and Surya Kanta Shastri.
I have myself been interested in this text for many years and have lo-
cated several new manuscripts of the Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā. The library
of the Vaidika Saṃsodhana Maṇḍaḷa, Pune, has three manuscripts of this text,
two of which bear the title Kautsa-Vyākaraṇa. These two manuscripts also
contain commentaries on this text by Bhārgava Bhāskara and Kr̥ṣṇadāsa, and
in an article published in 1976, I have discussed some points connected with
these manuscripts. In the course of my personal search for more manuscripts
of this text at Banaras in December 1979, I located a manuscript of the
Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā with a Maharashtrian Brahmin reciter of the
Atharvaveda, Shri Narayan Shastri Ratate, and with his kind permission was
able to obtain a Xerox copy of the same. A further significant discovery is that
of a manuscript at the Asiatic Society, Calcutta, which contains the same
commentary as in the Berlin manuscript used by Whitney, and that this
manuscript, though incomplete, is in a much better shape. This is a great help
in editing the text of this commentary.
2. Description of the Manuscripts
2.1. Below, I shall briefly describe all the manuscripts which are
utilized in the preparation of this critical edition:
A.Caturādhyāyikā. Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune.
No. 1/1873-74. Devanagari. Complete. Folios: 12-21, 10" x 5 1/2". From
Bikaner. ± 1700 A.D. The entire manuscript contains Pañcapaṭalikā,
Dantyoṣṭhyavidhi, Kālātītaprāyaścitta, Caturādhyāyikā and Atharvaprāti-
śākhya. There is no information about who copied this manuscript, when and

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 5
where, because there is no usual elaborate colophon at the end of the bundle.
Since the manuscript ends with the second Prapāṭhaka of the Atharva-
Prātiśākhya, most likely there are several missing folios.
B.Caturādhyāyikā. Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune.
No. 179/ 1880-81, 408. Devanagari. Complete. Folios: 56-66, 9 1/2" x 4".
From Anahilapurapattana \(= Patan in Gujarat\). The date given is Saṃvat 1717
\(= 1659 A.D.\) and the colophon provides a precise day: संवत् १७१७ वर्षे
भाद्रपदमासे कृष्णपक्षे ११ रविवासरे अद्ये श्रीअनहलपुरपत्तनमध्ये वास्तव्यं आभ्य-
न्तरनागरज्ञातीयपञ्चोलीसोमजीसुतबृहस्पतिजीपठनार्थम्. The entire manuscript contains
Māṇḍūkīśikṣā, Jyotiṣam, Mahāśāntiḥ, Pañcapaṭalikā, Dantyoṣṭhyavidhi,
Kālātītaprāyaścitta, Caturādhyāyikā, Atharvaprātiśākhya, and Chandaściti. The
manuscript makes irregular use of the Pr̥ṣṭhamātrās and the Avagraha. The
manuscript comes from the Pañcoli family of Patan. The first 27 folios are in a
different hand and are utterly damaged, which perhaps indicates a different age
for the two parts of the manuscripts.

6 INTRODUCTION
भवदेवेन इदं ग्रन्थं लिखितम्. This manuscript makes occasional use of the
Avagraha, but does not use Pr̥ṣṭhamātrās. Importantly, it lists 180 as the
measure of the text \(granthasaṃkhyā\). It was this manuscript which was
transcribed for Whitney who published the “Collation of the Second Manu-
script of the Atharvaveda-Prātiśākhya" \(1880\). The cover page of the manu-
script calls it Caturādhyāyikāvyākaraṇam and as a matter of fact it is closely
related with mss. F which also calls itself Caturādhyāyī-Vyākaraṇa.
F.Caturādhyāyī-Vyākaraṇa. Gore collection, Vaidika Saṃśo-
dhana Maṇḍaḷa, Pune. No. 4177. Devanagari. Complete. Folios 1-12, 9 1/2"
x 4 1/2". From Mahuli near Satara. 1819 A.D. The colophon says that the
manuscript was copied by a certain Raghunāthātmajamārtaṇḍabhaṭṭa. The date
is specified as: शके १७४३ वृषानामाब्दे संवत् १८७७ नन्दननामाब्दे दक्षिणायने हेमर्तौ
मार्गशीर्षशुक्लद्वितीया. It also mentions 180 as the measure of the work
\(granthasaṃkhyā, 180x32 = number of syllables?\). The manuscript came from
the Gore family, originally belonging to Mahuli near Satara. This family was
in charge of the Atharvavedic priestcraft for the king of Satara. Later the
family moved to Sangli. The manuscript occasionally uses the Avagraha, but
does not use Pr̥ṣṭhamātrās.
G.Kautsavyākaraṇasya Caturādhyāyātmakasya Bhārgavabhāskarī-
yavr̥ttiḥ. Gore collection, Vaidika Saṃśodhana Maṇḍaḷa, Pune. No. 4178.
Devanagari. Incomplete. Folios: 1-24, 7.9" x 4.2". From Sangli, Maha-
rashtra. ± 1700 A.D. This manuscript contains a commentary by Bhārgava
Bhāskara. An important feature of this manuscript is that in contrast with all
other manuscripts it gives three numbers for each rule, i.e. numbers for the
Adhyāya, Pāda, and Sūtra. It occasionally uses the Avagraha, but does not
make use of the Pr̥ṣṭhamātrā. In its incomplete state, it covers rules 1.1.10 to
1.4.8, or Whitney 1.8 to 1.99.

From North India. Saṃvat 1714 \(= 1656 A.D.\) This is the manuscript used
by Whitney for his edition. In this manuscript of the commentary, there is a
general pattern as follows. First a Sūtra is stated. Then it is explained and
analyzed in the commentary. Then the Sūtra is again repeated at the end of the
commentary. These three readings of the Sūtra are respectively labeled Ha, Hc,
and Hb.

however, a considerable portion of his collection was actually emersed into a
well by the last surviving lady of this line, possibly in a fit of despair, but,
thanks to the timely intervention of some authorities of Gwalior State, the
remnant could be rescued and deposited at the Oriental Manuscript Library of
Ujjain maintained by the state.”

An incomplete transcript of a Bikaner manuscript made by Roth. The original
could not be traced. The original manuscript contained the following texts:
Prāyaścitta, Māṇḍūkīśikṣā, Jyotiṣa, Mahāśānti, Pañcapaṭalikā, Dan-
tyoṣṭhyavidhi, Kālātītaprāyaścitta, Caturādhyāyikā, Prātiśākhyamūla-sūtra,
Chandaściti, and Nivitpraiṣādhyāyapuroruk. This manuscript generally
belongs together with the manuscripts B and D which come from Patan in
Gujarat.
M.Caturādhyāyī. Asiatic Society, Calcutta. No. 7852. Devana-
gari. Complete. Folios: 35b-43b, 4 1/4" x 9 1/2". Unknown origin. 1613
A.D. The date is specified as संवत् १६७१ वर्षे ज्येष्ठवदि ११. This manuscript
uses occasional Pr̥ṣṭhamātrās and the Avagraha. The manuscript also contains
the text of the Atharva-Prātiśākhya.
N.Caturadhyāyī-Bhāṣya. Asiatic Society, Calcutta. No. 1272.
Devanagari. Incomplete. Folios: 1-61a, 63b-64a, 101. 8 3/4" x 4 1/4". Un-
known origin. 1624 A.D. The colophon reads: संवत् १६८२ वर्षे पुरुषोत्तममासे
कृष्णपक्षे त्रयोदशीमन्दवासरे लिखितमिदम्. This commentary is identical with the
commentary found in the manuscript H from Berlin used by Whitney. Like the
manuscript H, N also repeats each Sūtra three times, and these three readings
are labeled Na, Nc, and Nb, respectively.

of Pr̥ṣṭhamātrās. The first and the last folios have a stamp in English showing
that the last owner was Mr. S.B. Vaidya of Durgaghat, Banaras, an
Atharvavedin Brahmin.
P.Caturādhyāyī. Sarasvati Bhavana Library, Sampurnanda San-
skrit Vishvavidyalaya. Banaras. No. 2074. Devanagari. Complete. 10 1/4" x
4 1/5". Folios 1-27. Caturādhyāyikā extends from folio 19 to 25. The ms.
contains Māṇḍūkīśikṣā, Jyotiṣam, Chandaściti, Pañcapaṭalikā, Dantyo-
ṣṭhyavidhi, Kāltītaprāyaścittam, Caturādhyāyikā, and Atharva-Prātiśākhya. It
is a relatively old ms., and it makes occasional use of Pr̥ṣṭhamātrās. On folio
13, it gives the date of copying as संवत् १६८५ वर्षे मागशरवदि ५ गुरौ लिखितम्.
However, on folio 27, at the end of the manu-script, a different hand adds संवत्
१६३४ वर्षे आश्वनशुदि १५ दिने पंचोलि श्री इश्वर लक्षणग्रंथ भणे छे पंचोलि श्री गोविन्दजी
कनेर \(?\) भणे छे. It looks like the ms. belonged to the Pañcolī family of
Gujarat. The original ms. probably goes back to Saṃvat 1685, and that it was
supplemented and corrected by another hand in Saṃvat 1734. The same
person, Śrī Īśvara Pañcolī, is referred to in the ms. C above, and both the
manuscripts probably belong to the same family. It is clear that the same hand
has added corrections to both of these manuscripts.
2.2. I propose the following genealogy for these manuscripts.

2.3. Taking into account the significant shared errors and other shared
deviant features, the following groups of manuscripts seem to have strong
relationships. The number given in the bracket stands for the shared errors and
other shared deviant features noted in this edition: A-B-D \(47\), A-B \(44\), A-
B-D-M-J \(16\), A-B-D-M \(11\), A-B-D-J \(4\), A-B-L \(4\), B-D \(21\), C-E-F \(6\),
C-E-F-I \(5\), C-H-N \(4\), E-F \(27\), E-F-H \(4\), E-F-I \(28\), F-I \(4\), H-N \(42\). It
is not necessary to record information about groups of manuscripts which
share one or two errors. The above chart takes into account this information.
Some of these relationships are particularly complex. For example, consider
the relationship between A, B, and D. All three share 47 common deviations,
and hence must go back to a common source. However, A and B share 44
common deviations which are different from the 21 common deviations shared
by B and D. This must mean that the source of A and B must be slightly
different from the source of B and D. In my opinion, the only way to resolve
this situation is to suggest that the manuscript B used multiple sources. One of
its sources was shared in common with A. However, another source for B
was shared in common with D. The manuscripts O and P became available to
me after all other manuscripts were already collated and the basic relationships
were determined. I have shown their appropriate relationships in the diagram
above, though I have not given counts of shared deviant features.
This stemma should be viewed only as a convenient grouping of the
manuscript material. One must keep in mind the possibility and the proba-
bility that the persons copying and correcting the manuscripts used various
sources, and this accounts for the erratic readings, which violate the otherwise
plausible linkages between the manuscripts. Thus, while the manuscripts B, C,
D, and P, all derive from Anahilapurapattana \(= Patan in Gujarat\), the
manuscript C seems to share closer links with the manuscript E from
Kaṇvālaya in Gujarat and F from Maharashtra. One may also note that the mss.
C, E, and F contain only the text of the CA, while the mss. in the X group
contain other texts besides the CA, and they usually contain the same set of
texts. As a general observation, it is interesting to note all the manuscripts seem
to derive from the Western regions ranging from Rajasthan to Maharashtra,
and that the regions of Southern and Eastern India are not represented in these
available manuscripts.
3. New Features of the Critical Edition
3.1. Here I shall briefly indicate some of the important gains which
are already evident from the manuscript material now available to us. Whitney

10 INTRODUCTION
had divided his text only into four Adhyāyas. He knew that each Adhyāya had
four Pādas, but his manuscript was not clear on these divisions. Hence, he
could not subdivide each Adhyāya into Pādas. The manuscript material now
available settles this issue once and for all. Below I have given the colophons
occurring at the end of the first Pāda of the first Adhyāya as found in the
various manuscripts. 
A, B, M, Pप्रथमः पादः ।
Cइति चतुराध्यायिकायां प्रथमस्याध्यायस्य प्रथमः पादः ।
Dइति प्रथमः पादः ।
E, Fप्रथमस्य प्रथमः पादः ।
Gइत्यथर्ववेदाङ्गकौत्सव्याकरणे प्रथमाध्यायस्य प्रथमपादस्य 
भार्गवभास्करीयवृत्तिः परिपूर्णा ।
H, Nचतुराध्यायिकायां प्रथमस्याध्यायस्य प्रथमः पादः । सूत्र ४१ ।
एकचत्वाशिंत् ।
I४१ इत्यथर्ववेदे कौत्सव्याकरणे प्रथमस्याध्यायस्य प्रथमः पादः ।
Jइति प्रथमाध्यायस्य प्रथमः पादः ।
O१ ॥ ४१ ॥ इत्यथर्ववेदे कौत्सव्याकरणे चतुराध्यायिकस्य प्रथमः पादः ॥
Since all of these colophons occur at the same juncture, we can now be
completely certain where the Pādas end, and we can now subdivide the text
properly.
3.2. Several prose and metrical passages found in the Berlin manu-
script were relegated by Whitney to the commentary. He did not consider them
to be part of the text of the CA. Several of these passages are found in almost
all the manuscripts which give only the text of the Sūtras of the CA. This
helps us assign these passages to the text of the CA, rather than to the text of
the commentary. For instance, Whitney \(1.105\) reads as follows:
खण्वखा३ इ खैमखा इ मध्ये तदुरि । इदं भूया३ इदा३मिति । ऊर्ध्वो नु
सृष्टा३स्तिर्यङ्नु सृष्टा३ः सर्वा दिशः पुरुष आ बभूवाँ३ । पराञ्चमोदनं
प्राशीः प्रत्यञ्चामिति । त्वमोदनं प्राशीस्त्वामोदना३ इति । वशेया३मवशे-
ति। यत्तदासी३दिदं नु ता३दिति। इति प्लुतानि ।
Whitney includes this long passage in the Berlin manuscript in the text
of the Caturādhyāyikā, but stops abruptly, while the passage actually continues
further in that manuscript:

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 11
किमर्थः परिपाठः । इत उत्तरम् अधिकम् । एतावत् स्वार्थोऽपि । बहुविधा-
स्त्रिविधाः प्लुतयो भवन्ति । स्वरपरा अभिनिष्ठानपरा व्यञ्जनपरास्तासां याः
समानाक्षरपरास्ता इतावप्लुतवद्भवन्ति । इतावप्लुतवद्भवन्ति ।
The entire passage with some minor variations is now supported by the
manuscripts A, B, D, E, F, H, I, J, M, N, O and P and it is most certainly a
part of the text of the CA. There are many such passages. On the other hand,
many passages which are ascribed to the commentary by Whitney are not
found in any of the manuscripts of the CA, and hence we know that they in-
deed do not form a part of the CA. 
3.3. The new manuscripts help us detect rules which are missing in
Whitney’s edition and in the Berlin manuscript. For instance:
After Whitney \(3.28\), the manuscripts A, B, D, E, F, I, J, M,
N, O and P have the rules छकारश्च \(or °स्य\) and पिप्पल्यादिषु पूर्वात्.
After Whitney \(3.80\), the manuscripts A, B, C, D, E, F, I, J, M,
O and P have the rules नसश्च, धातुस्थादयकारात्, उरु,
ब्रह्मण्वत्यादीनाम् and निपातस्य \(or °श्च\) स्वः.
After Whitney \(3.86\), the manuscripts A, B, C, D, E, F, I, J, M,
O and P have the rule नभेः.
After Whitney \(4.93\), the manuscripts A, B, C, D, E, F, I, J, M,
O and P have the rule इंग्यवच्च.
After Whitney \(4.107\), the manuscripts A, B, C, D, E, F, I, J,
M, O and P have the rule संहितादार्ढ्यार्थम्.
Many of these rules were noticed by Whitney himself in his “Collation
of the Second Manuscript” in 1880, and were again noticed by S.L. Katre
\(1938-39: 384\). Now with the help of the substantially increased manuscript
evidence, we can be more certain about the text of these rules.
3.4. The manuscripts occasionally offer a different splitting of rules
from what has been offered by Whitney. For instance, consider the three rules
given by Whitney:
Whitney \(1.14\):समानयमेऽक्षरमुच्चैरुदात्तम् ।
Whitney \(1.15\):नीचैरनुदात्तम् ।

12 INTRODUCTION
Whitney \(1.16\):आक्षिप्तं स्वरितम् ।
Now, all the manuscripts we have give just one continuous rule as:
समानयमेऽक्षरमुच्चैरुदात्तं नीचैरनुदात्तमाक्षिप्तं स्वरितम् ।
The manuscript G in fact provides a single number \(i.e. 1.1.16\) for this
rule.
3.5. In some cases, the manuscripts help us discard some of Whit-
ney’s emendations. Consider the following examples:
Whitney \(1.19\): कण्ठ्यानाम् अधरकण्ठः. Against the reading of the
Berlin manuscript, i.e. °kaṇṭhyaḥ, Whitney emended the text to
°kaṇṭhaḥ. Now the Berlin manuscript stands supported by all
manuscripts, except I which supports Whitney’s emendation.
However, I believe it is most likely that this widely shared
reading is an error going back to the archetype.
Whitney \(1.25\): ओष्ठ्यानामधरौष्ठम्. This goes against the reading
of the Berlin manuscript, i.e. °auṣṭhyam. The Berlin reading is
supported by all manuscripts, except I which supports
Whitney’s emendation. However, I believe it is most likely that
this widely shared reading is an error going back to the
archetype.
Whitney \(1.82\): आर्त्नी इवादिष्विवादितिः परः. Berlin reads
°ditiparaḥ. This is supported by all the manuscripts.
3.6. several cases, the manuscripts now available support Whit-
ney’s expectations. Consider the following rules:
Whitney \(1.66\): लकारस्य रेफः पादमंगुलिमित्येवमादीनाम्. Whitney
says on this rule: “We should have expected here pādam-
aṃgurim ...” Whitney’s expectation is supported by all the
available manuscripts, including a reading in the Berlin manu-
script, i.e. H.
Whitney \(2.92\): स्थासहिसिचीनामकारव्यवायेऽपि. The Berlin text is
severely mutilated, and the above text is Whitney’s own con-

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ  13
jecture, which is now fully supported by the manuscripts C, D,
E, F, I, J, M, N, O and P.
Whitney \(3.29\): \[न\] विसर्जनीयः. There is no support for na in the
Berlin manuscript, and this is Whitney’s conjecture. It is now
supported by the manuscripts A, B, D, E, F, I, J, M, N, O and
P.
3.7. I hope I have sufficiently illustrated the new features of the
present critical edition of the CA alias Kautsa-Vyākaraṇa, and the extent to
which it replaces Whitney’s pioneering work. It is hoped that this critical
edition of the CA will open up new dimensions for the study of the Atharva-
veda and its ancillary literature. As indicated above, the new manuscript
material leads to a wholly new numbering for the rules of the CA. Most of the
manuscripts do not provide any numbering whatsoever. However, there are
several manuscripts which do provide numbering of the rules in different
ways. For instance, manuscript G provides a continuous numbering for all
rules. It gives the number of the Adhyāya, the Pāda, and the Sūtra. Manu-
script I provides numbering within each Pāda, mostly for rules 10, 20, etc. The
mss. H and N provide cumulative numbers for the Pādas and Adhyāyas. The
ms. O also provides, in its colophons, totals for the rules in each Pāda. The
numbers provided in these different mss. do not always agree with each other,
but tell us something about the different textual traditions, some of which
included more material than others. Sometimes we find that a given tradition of
transmission split a rule into two, or joined two rules into one. Such changes
obviously affected the counting of rules in the text. Below, I have provided a
complete numbering of the CA rules found in this edition, along with the
corresponding numbers in Whitney’s edition, and the numbers found in
different manuscripts:
3.8. This edition presents not only the revised text of the CA, but a
fairly complete text of the commentary Caturādhyāyībhāṣya \(= CAB\) based on
two manuscripts. It further offers partial texts of the commentaries Vr̥tti by
Bhārgava-Bhāskara and a reworking of the CA rules with a commentary called
Pañcasandhi by Kr̥ṣṇadāsa, along the lines of Bhaṭtojī Dīkṣita’s Sidhānta-
Kaumudī and Anubhūtisvarūpācārya’s Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa. Both of these
commentaries are edited here on the basis of single manuscripts preserved at
the Vaidika Saṃśodhana Maṇḍaḷa at Pune. The three commentaries are
discussed in some detail later in this introduction in the context of the
successive degrees of Pāṇinian influence. We know nothing about the authors

14 INTRODUCTION
of these commentaries, beside their names. For the Caturādhyāyībhāṣya, we
do not even know the name of its author. In general terms, one may say that
the Caturādhyāyībhāṣya belongs to a period closer to the Kāśikāvr̥tti on Pāṇini,
while the other two commentaries seem to follow Bhaṭṭojī Dīkṣita’s
Siddhāntakaumudī. The Caturādhyāyībhāṣya is also very closely linked to the
tradition as represented by the Atharva-Prātiśākhya edited by Surya Kanta. In
several hundred cases, the CAB cites the first few examples from a long list of
examples fully listed under the rules of the APR. In my notes on the CA, I
have fully indicated this relationship. On the other hand, the commentaries of
Bhārgava-Bhāskara and Kr̥ṣṇadāsa are completely unaware of the existence of
the CAB or the APR, and explain the rules of the CA more on the basis of the
parallel rules of Pāṇini. Even here, one notices that the commentary of
Bhārgava-Bhāskara shows full familiarity with the text of the Śaunakīya AV,
while Kr̥ṣṇadāsa hardly ever cites examples from the AV. The Caturādhyāyī-
bhāṣya is closely familiar with an ancient Śikṣā which is in part also contained
in the AV Pariśiṣṭa called Varṇapaṭala, but is not familiar with either the
Māṇḍūkīśikṣā or the versified Pāṇinīyaśikṣā. In contrast with this, the latter
two commentaries show no awareness of the ancient Śikṣā cited by the CAB.
On the other hand, they show direct familiarity with the Māṇḍūkīśikṣā and the
versified Pāṇinīyaśikṣā. Thus, the present edition provides means to
understand the changing nature of the CA tradition from a period going close
to that of Pāṇini to a period coming close to that of Bhaṭṭojī Dīkṣita. During
this long period, the text of the CA underwent successive interpretations at the
hands of commentators who were gradually more and more influenced by the
tradition of the Pāṇinian commentaries. It is hoped that more manuscripts of
these commentaries will come to light in the future and a more complete
account of this tradition can be eventually put together. However, I am
delighted to present the available materials in this edition. I have been engaged
in collecting and interpreting these materials almost since 1975 when I first
noticed the manuscripts available in Pune at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research
Institute and at the Vaidika Saṃśodhana Maṇḍaḷ. Now I have made use of
almost every known manuscript \(and also some not listed in Aithal 1991\) in
preparing this edition which marks a substantial advance over the edition
prepared so valiantly by Whitney in 1862 on the basis of a single manuscript.

Colophons: H: 105 \(cumulative for this Adhyāya\); I: 125 \(cumulative for this
Adhyāya\); O: 29 \(identical with the count in I\). The difference of twenty
rules in the counting for this Adhyāya in the mss. H and I can be explained
only on the assumption that H considered certain passages as belonging to the

26 INTRODUCTION
commentary. This refers in all likelihood to CA 3.3.1-5 and CA 3.3.26-35. In
our count, these are 15 rules, which Whitney relegated to the commentary.
However, as the colophon in O on Adhyāya 3, Pāda 3 shows, some traditions
counted 40 rules in this Pāda, instead of our 35. There is a strong possibility
that the verses in CA 3.3.1-4, and the prose in CA 3.3.5, were counted as
having two rules each. This accounts for 20 rules. It is clear that the ms H of
the CAB contains all these passages and yet does not count them as Sūtras.
On the other hand, the ms. I gives 125 as the total number of rules in this
Adhyāya, indicating that it includes these passages as part of the text. This is
also supported by the ms. O.

Colophons: H: 47. This agrees with Whitney’s exclusion of CA 4.1.1-22 as
belonging to the commentary and not to the text of the CA. On the other hand
I gives 98 as the number of rules in this Pāda, while O gives 99 as the number
of the same rules. Our number is 68. How do we account for this difference?
We can only suggest that the passages in CA 4.1.1-22 were differently sliced
into separate sūtras by the traditions represented by I and O. While the
manuscript H physically contains these passages, it does not count them among
the Sūtras of the CA. We have no way of knowing how exactly these
passages were subdivided.

certain passages which he thought belonged to the commentary rather than to
the text of the CA. The figure 516 found in the ms. I as the total for all the
rules is explainable by supposing that this counting resulted because of
primarily the included verses being represented as each containing at least two
Sūtras, if not more. There are actually no extra passages as such. The figure
580 found in the ms. F as the total of all rules could possibly accounted for if
we assume that each of the included verses is equivalent to four Sūtras. Such a
calculation comes close to this figure. Again, we must note that the ms. F does
not actually have any extra passages as such. 
4. General Features of the Ancient Indian 
Phonetics1
4.1. Ancient Indian Phonetics
4.1.1. The tradition of phonetic analysis and description of Sanskrit
in ancient India developed as one of the traditional tools used for the preserva-
tion and propagation of the Vedas, the religious scriptures of the ancient
Hindus and it eventually came to be incorporated in a vastly developed tradition
of Sanskrit grammar. While the Vedic literature was originally composed by
individual Vedic priests and was orally maintained by generations of Vedic
priestly families, eventually the Vedic texts came to be collected and edited into
organized volumes, and systematic efforts were made to preserve both the texts
themselves as well as the understanding of the meaning and the ritual
application of these texts. The results of this organized effort have survived in
the form of manuals of various kinds pertaining to various Vedic schools.
Among these manuals, many deal with topics of linguistic interest, i.e.
phonetics \(Śikṣā\), metrics \(Chandas\), etymology \(Nirukta\), and grammar
\(Vyākaraṇa\). 
The treatises on phonetics, generally divided into two types called
Śikṣās and Prātiśākhyas, deal with specific Vedic texts and their recitation,
rather than dealing with Sanskrit or Vedic language as such. This makes the

Indian Phonetics” which appeared in The Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics, Volume
6, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1994. I am grateful to the publisher for granting me permission

32 INTRODUCTION
phonetic manuals very special in some sense. The observations contained in
the phonetic manuals are of a non-generalized, highly specific nature, and thus
they provide for us a microscopically detailed picture of the sounds of Sanskrit
as used in specific oral scriptural traditions. They contain a highly developed
set of analytical tools and terminology which has won the admiration of
Western linguists and Sanskritists ever since the discovery of Sanskrit by the
West \(cf. Whitney 1884, Allen 1953: 3ff\).
4.2. Origins of Sanskrit Phonetics
4.2.1. The various Vedic texts were produced in different regions of
India, beginning with about 1500 B.C. in the Northwestern corner, and the
texts produced in one region were carried orally into other areas. During this
movement, there was social and linguistic contact and convergence with peo-
ples who were historically of non-Indo-European backgrounds, e.g. Dravidi-
ans, Tibeto-Burmans, and Austro-Asiatics. As a result of this contact and
convergence, the Indo-Aryan dialects continuously went on changing and
slowly a gap began to develop between the language of the preserved ancient
scriptures and the language of the contemporary colloquial usage. This gap
began to affect both the phonetic form of the orally preserved scriptural texts as
well as their comprehension. A realization of this gap and its perceived
negative impact on the preserved scriptural texts is indeed the starting point of
the development of the analytical efforts reflected in the manuals left to us by
the Vedic schools. On the phonetic side, it is quite clear that the same text was
pronounced with slight differences eventually leading to doubts as to the exact
wording. Emergence of sounds such as the retroflex consonants within the
Indo-Aryan dialects was a gradual process leading to more or less retroflexed
versions of the same Vedic text. The accents of ancient Vedic dialects were
preserved as musical pitch variation in the recitation of Vedic texts, but these
were no longer used in the colloquial contemporary dialects. Thus, it became
increasingly difficult to naturally pronounce the Vedic texts with proper
accents. The late Vedic texts \(e.g. Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa 1.6.3.8-10\) narrate an
interesting story about how a demon named Tvaṣṭr̥ mispronounced a ritual
expression and achieved disastrous results. The demon wished to have a son
who would slay god Indra. Thus, he should have asked for a son who would
be indraśatrú ‘Indra’s slayer.’ However, being an ignorant demon, he
mispronounced this expression as índraśatru which gave him a son who was
killed by Indra. The version of this story in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa says that
the demon actually should have said: indrasya śatrur vardhasva. This has been

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 33
interpreted by scholars like Johannes Bronkhorst to suggest that using the
proper accents for compounds had already become so difficult by this time, that
the text asks that the compound be broken down to a phrase to avoid the
confusion once for all. This story has been cited by phoneticians and
grammarians to indicate why it is so important to learn how to properly
pronounce the Vedic scriptures. 
4.2.2. The pre-scientific phase of Sanskrit phonetics is already mani-
fest in the earliest Vedic literature. The terms akṣara ‘letter, sound, syllable’
and pada ‘metrical foot,’ \[and ‘word’ in some contexts\] go back to the different
phases of the Vedic literature. Thieme \(1985\) has presented an important
conjecture concerning the beginnings of Sanskrit phonetics. Thieme translates
the first verse of the Śaunakīya-Atharvaveda as follows:
ये त्रि॑ष॒प्ताः प॑रि॒यन्ति॒ विश्वा॑ रू॒पाणि॒ बिभ्र॑तः ।
वा॒चस्पति॒र्बला॒ तेष॑ां त॒न्वो॑ अ॒द्य द॑धातु मे ॥ \(शौ.अ.वे. १.१.१\)
“The thrice seven that go around, wearing all the shapes -- let
the Lord of Speech put their powers into my body’s parts
today.” 
After detailed argumentation, Thieme concludes that this verse refers to
twenty-one sounds of Sanskrit as distinctly conceived by the earliest Vedic
thinkers and he lists them as follows:
a i  u r̥ e o ai au8 vowels
y r l v4 semi-vowels
k c ṭ t p5 occlusives
ś ṣ s h4 spirants
Thieme \(1985: 563\) argues that “the sacred number ‘thrice seven’ could
indeed be taken as the number of the abstract forms \(ākr̥ti-\), of the types, the
kinds \(varṇa-\) of sounds of the sacred language.” Such a listing, if indeed this
is what is intended by the verse, would indicate that certain phonetic features
were perhaps understood more clearly by this time than others, and that the
number twenty-one, in all likelihood, is a reflection of this early pre-scientific
phase, rather than an explicit representation of the “types” of Sanskrit sounds
as found in the later developed texts on Sanskrit phonetics. Perhaps, the
distinctions between the different points of articulation were implicitly
understood, while the distinctions of quantity, voicing, aspiration, etc. were not
arrived at. 

34 INTRODUCTION
4.2.3. However, there is one major difficulty in accepting Thieme’s
interpretation. It is not clear that all the classes of sounds listed by him in order
to arrive at the number twenty-one were definitely recognized by the ancient
phoneticians in India. We find several phonetic categories mentioned explicitly
in late Vedic texts like the Aitareya-Āraṇyaka \(2.2.4\):
तद्वा इदं बृहतीसहस्रं सम्पन्नम् । तस्य यानि व्यञ्जनानि तच्छरीरं, यो घोषः
स आत्मा, य ऊष्माणः स प्राणः ।
“Thus, this \[collection of\] a thousand br̥hatī verses comes into
existence. Of that collection, the consonants \(vyañjana\) are the
body, the voice \(ghoṣa = vowels\) is its soul, and the spirants
\(ūṣman\) are its vital breath.”
In the Chāndogya-Upaniṣad \(2.22.5\), vowels \(svara\) are distinguished
explicitly from consonants \(vyañjana\), and among the consonants, a distinction
is made between stops, i.e. sparśa ‘contact sounds,’ and spirants, i.e. ūṣman
‘aspiration sounds’: 
सर्वे स्वरा घोषवन्तो बलवन्तो वक्तव्याः ... सर्व ऊष्माणोऽग्रस्ता अनिरस्ता
विवृता वक्तव्याः ... सर्वे स्पर्शा लेशेनानभिहिता वक्तव्याः ।
“All vowels \(svara\) should be pronounced with resonance
\(ghoṣa\) and force. ... All spirants \(ūṣman\) should be pro-
nounced open, and not constricted or spitted out. ... All stops
\(sparśa = contact sounds\) should be pronounced slightly in-
complete.”
4.2.4. While these terms seem to have been well established by the
period of the Āraṇyakas, such is indeed not the case with the category of
antaḥsthā. The Aitareya-Āraṇyaka \(3.2.1\) tells us that the specific category of
semi-vowels \(antasthā / antaḥsthā\) was newly proposed by the scholar Hrasva
Māṇḍūkeya, but that it was as yet not recognized by the author of the Aitareya-
Āraṇyaka.
तस्यैतस्यात्मनः प्राण ऊष्मरूपमस्थीनि स्पर्शरूपं मज्जानः स्वररूपं मांसं
लोहितमित्येतदन्यच्चतुर्थमन्त\(ः\)स्थारूपमिति ह स्माह ह्रस्वो माण्डूकेयः ।
त्रयं त्वेव न एतत्प्रोक्तम् ।
“Of this self, the breath is like the spirants \(ūṣman\), the bones
the mutes \(sparśa\), the marrow the vowels \(svara\), and flesh
and blood the fourth part, the semi-vowels \(antasthā\). So says

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 35
Hrasva Māṇḍūkeya. However, only three elements have
been taught to us.”
We know from other evidence \(Deshpande 1979: 261\) that the
scholarly tradition of Hrasva Māṇḍūkeya came from the Northeastern region of
Magadha, and that it is an innovative tradition, which among other things
admitted more retroflexion into the oral text of the R̥gveda, and that its views
were contested by others. If indeed the above statement of the Aitareya-
Āraṇyaka can be interpreted as an indication that the category of antaḥsthā was
a relatively late category, this then raises serious doubts concerning Paul
Thieme’s interpretation of the first verse of the Śaunakīya-Atharvaveda as
referring to twenty-one types of Sanskrit sounds including the four antaḥsthā
sounds. If the inference based on the Aitareya-Āraṇyaka is correct, it would
seem more likely that in a much more ancient period, such as the composition
of the AV hymns, the vowels and the semi-vowels were not analytically
distinguished from each other. Since the semi-vowels are not covered by either
the term sparśa or ūṣman appearing in the Āraṇyaka literature, the non-
distinction of semi-vowels from vowels is perhaps the strongest possibility for
the earlier period. If vowels and semi-vowels were not yet clearly
distinguished at this early period of the composition of the Saṃhitās, we may
need to reconsider our understanding of the early form of the Saṃhitās as
conceived by the pre-Āraṇyaka traditions. I am simply mentioning this subject
here. I shall deal with it exhaustively on another occasion.
4.3. Emergence of Formal Phonetic Analysis
4.3.1. Sometime around 700 B.C., a standardized ordered alphabet of
Sanskrit called akṣarasamāmnāya had come into existence. By this process, I
am referring to an ordered presentation or grouping of Sanskrit sounds, with
no necessary connection with any form of writing. This standardization was
necessitated, among other things, by an increasing diglossic gap between the
language of the orally preserved Vedic texts and the contemporary Sanskrit, as
well as the vernacular languages. There was a perceived loss of the natural
ability to correctly pronounce and recite the Vedic scriptures. The discussions
concerning the need to study Sanskrit phonetics as seen in the introductory
chapter of the MB of Patañjali \(± 100 B.C.\) show that the origin of the
analytical tradition of Sanskrit phonetics lies in the urge to preserve the
standardized pronunciation of the Vedic texts and to protect them from further
deterioration.

36 INTRODUCTION
4.3.2. The earliest scholars who seem to have paid attention to the
form of the Vedic texts, especially their wording and pronunciation, are
Śākalya, Śūravīra Māṇḍūkeya, and Hrasva Māṇḍūkeya. The Aitareya-
Āraṇyaka \(3.2.6\) points to the fact that Śākalya followed the tradition of the
Māṇḍūkeyas to a large extent:2
अथ हास्मा एतत्कृष्णहारितो वाग्ब्राह्मणमिवोपोदाहरति । प्रजापतिः प्रजाः
सृष्ट्वा व्यस्रंसत संवत्सरः । स च्छन्दोभिरात्मानं समदधात् तस्मात्संहिता ।
तस्यै वा एतस्यै संहितायै णकारो बलं षकारः प्राण आत्मा । स यो हैतौ
णकारषकारवनुसंहितमृचो वेद सबलां सप्राणां संहितां वेदायुष्यमिति
विद्यात्। स यदि विचिकित्सेत्सणकारं ब्रवाणी३ँ अणकाराँ३ इति
सणकारमेव ब्रूयात्सषकारं ब्रवाणी३ँ अषकाराँ३ इति सषकारमेव ब्रूयात्। ते
यद् वयमनुसंहितमृचोऽधीमहे यच्च माण्डूकेयीयमध्यायं प्रब्रूमस्तेन नो
णकारषकारा उपाप्ताविति ह स्माह ह्रस्वो माण्डूकेयः । अथ यद्वयमनुसंहित-
मृचोऽधीमहे यच्च माण्डूकेयीयमध्यायं प्रब्रूमस्तेन नो णकारषकारा उपाप्ता-
विति ह स्माह स्थविरः शाकल्यः ।
\(Edited by A.B. Keith. Oxford University Press, 1909, 
pp. 138-9\)
Now Kr̥ṣṇahārīta proclaims this secret doctrine, as it were, re-
garding speech to him. Prajāpati, the year, after creating
creatures, burst. He put himself together by means of the
meters, therefore it is the saṃhitā. Of that saṃhitā, the letter ṇ is
the strength, the letter ṣ the breath, the self. He who knows the
saṃhitā and the letters ṇ and ṣ, he knows the saṃhitā with its
breath and its strength. ... If he is in doubt whether to say it with
an ṇ or without an ṇ, let him say it with an ṇ. If he is in doubt
whether to say it with an ṣ or without an ṣ, let him say it with an
ṣ. Hrasva Māṇḍūkeya says: “If we repeat the verses according
to the Saṃhitā, and if we recite according to the teaching of the
Māṇḍūkeya, then the letters ṇ and ṣ are obtained for us.”

2 The Śāṃkhāyana-Āraṇyaka 8.11 \(ed. by Bhim Dev, Vishveshvarananda Vaidika Research
Institute, Hoshiarpur, 1980\) contains an important variant of the Aitareya-Āraṇyaka passage:
ते यद्वयमनुसंहितमृचोऽधीमहे यच्च माण्डूकेयीयमध्यायं प्रब्रूमस्तेन नो णकारषकारा उपाप्ताविति ह स्माह
ह्रस्वो माण्डूकेयः । अथ यद्वयमनुसंहितमृचोऽधीमहे यच्च स्वाध्यायमधीमहे, तेना नो णकारषकारा
उपाप्ताविति ह स्माह स्थविरः शाकल्यः । While the Aitareya-Āraṇyaka passage clearly indicates
that Śākalya was a follower of the Māṇḍūkeya school on certain matters, the Śāṃkhāyana-
Āraṇyaka makes this relationship a little less clear. The introductory section called
Vargadvaya at the beginning of the R̥gvedaprātiśākhya seems to suggest that the Māṇḍūkeyas
were more ancient, and it seems more likely that the relationship as inferred from the
Aitareya-Āraṇyaka is historically justified.

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 37
Sthavira Śākalya says: “If we repeat the verses according to the
Saṃhitā, and if we recite according to the teaching of the
Māṇḍūkeya, then the letters ṇ and ṣ are obtained for us.”
4.3.3. These authorities were also perhaps some of the earliest schol-
arly figures who attempted to construct rules for combining words of the
Padapāṭha to produce a continuous scriptural text \(saṃhitā\). The general
assumption seems to have been that the continuous Vedic texts needed to be
explicitly produced by applying the rules of sandhi to the word-by-word texts
provided by scholars like Śākalya \(cf. padaprakr̥tiḥ saṃhitā, NR 1.17; RPR
2.1\). Thus, these early traditions did not offer any details on how to segment
the received continuous texts, but they were engaged in figuring out the rules
of sandhi which applied to the word-by-word texts to recreate the continuous
texts. Thus, the concern of these early phoneticians and exegetes was two-
fold, i.e. the proper pronunciation of the Vedic texts and figuring out the rules
for performing sandhi operations on the word-by-word texts to produce the
continuous texts. The first concern was responsible for developing the
analytical study of the articulation of sounds, while the second concern was
responsible for the search for features and groupings of these sounds which
could be used in formulating the rules of sandhi. In these two concerns, we
can see the origins of the phonetic and phonological theories of the ancient
Indian phoneticians and grammarians.
4.3.4. The word śikṣā refers to training in general, and phonetic or
recitational training in particular. It appears in the Taittirīya-Upaniṣad \(1.2\)
which refers specifically to six types of training involved in phonetic education,
i.e. varṇa ‘sounds,’ svara ‘accents,’ mātrā ‘quantity,’ bala ‘force,’ sāma ‘even
articulation,’ and santāna ‘continuity in recitation.’ In later times, over a
hundred texts called Śikṣās were produced by different authorities. Most of
the surviving Śikṣā texts are of a relatively late period. The most well known
among these Śikṣās is the Pāṇinīyaśikṣā attributed by the tradition to the fa-
mous Sanskrit grammarian Pāṇini. Other important Śikṣās include the
Vyāsaśikṣā, the Āpiśaliśikṣā, the Yājñavalkyaśikṣā, and the Nāradaśikṣā. A
few of these Śikṣā texts, such as the Pāṇinīyaśikṣā and the Āpiśaliśikṣā, are
non-“sectarian” in the sense that they do not attach themselves to a particular
Vedic school, and deal with the Sanskrit language in a generic way. However,
most Śikṣā texts are “sectarian.” They are attached to particular Vedic schools,
and deal with the recitation of particular Vedic texts. They often provide the
most minute details of the recitational practice.

38 INTRODUCTION
4.3.5. The second category of texts dealing with Sanskrit phonetics,
traditionally considered to be more authoritative than the Śikṣās, is represented
by the Prātiśākhyas. As the word prātiśākhya \[< prati ‘each’ \+ śākhā ‘branch’\]
suggests, each branch of the Vedic literature was ideally expected to have a
Prātiśākhya text attached to it. Among the surviving texts of this type, we must
mention the following important treatises. The R̥gveda-Prātiśākhya attributed
to Śaunaka belongs to the Śaiśirīya branch of the R̥gveda, which is no longer
extant. It refers to the views of Śākalya, whose edition of the R̥gveda survives,
but there is no extant Prātiśākhya attributed to Śākalya. The Taittirīya-
Prātiśākhya is attached to the Taittirīya school of the Black Yajurveda. The
Vājasaneyi-Prātiśākhya is attached to the White Yajurveda. A text called the
Bhāṣika-Sūtra deals with the recitation of the late Vedic prose text of the
Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa belonging to the tradition of the White Yajurveda. There
are five texts which fall in the general category of the Prātiśākhyas of the
Sāmaveda. Of these five texts, only the R̥ktantra deals with the general
discussion of phonetics. There are two texts, i.e. the Atharva-Prātiśākhya and
the Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā, associated with the Śaunakīya school of the
Atharvaveda. The exact dating of the Śikṣās and the Prātiśākhyas has been a
topic of long-standing debates. In general, one can say that the existing Śikṣās
seem to be “all of them, young, elaborations of the definitions laid down in the
Prātiśākhyas,” \(Thieme 1935: 85-6\). The existing Prātiśākhyas themselves
seem to have old and new textual layers in them, some pre-dating the
grammarian Pāṇini \(± 500 B.C.\), others reflecting post-Pāṇinian develop-
ments. 
4.4. Formation of Sanskrit Alphabet
4.4.1. Referred to by the term akṣara-samāmnāya ‘collective state-
ment of sounds,’ an ordered Sanskrit alphabet, with no reference to writing
intended, seems to have come into existence by the time the late Vedic literature
\(about 700 B.C.\) was produced. A distinction between vowels and consonants
was already made. The consonants were generally divided into three
categories, sparśa ‘contact sounds,’ antaḥsthā ‘in-between sounds,’ and uṣman
‘aspiration sounds.’ The first category included stops and nasals, the second
category included semi-vowels, and the third category included spirants. A
further amplification resulted in the following generally accepted alphabet:

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 39
Vowels:a ā i ī u ū r̥ r̥̄ l̥ e o ai au
Consonants:
sparśa:k khg gh ṅ
cchjjhñ
ṭṭhḍḍhṇ
tthddhn
pphbbhm
antaḥsthā:yrlv
ūṣmanś ṣsh
Additional sounds:
Anusvāraṃ
Visargaḥ 
Jihvāmūlīyaḫ \(before k, kh\)
Upadhmānīyaẖ \(before p, ph\)
4.4.2. The above alphabet, or rather the formal listing of sounds, is
accepted with minor differences by all the Śikṣās and Prātiśākhyas. The al-
phabet shows a tacit awareness of several features of sounds, and a certain
ordering of those features. The vowels are grouped into several sub-groups.
The first group is represented by the vowels a, ā, i, ī, u, and ū. These are the
basic simple vowels. They are ordered back-to-front in terms of their points of
articulation, i.e. throat \(kaṇṭha\), palate \(tālu\), and lips \(oṣṭha\). This order is the
reverse of the front-to-back order of listing the sounds in western linguistics,
e.g. p, t, k. To these basic simple vowels are added the vocalic r̥, r̥̄, l̥, \(and l̥̄ for
some traditions\). All these together, beginning with a, are called samāna
‘simple’ vowels. They are grouped into pairs of short and long vowels, and
each pair is often subsumed under a common generalization called varṇa, e.g.
the vowels a and ā belong to the family or type designated by the term a-varṇa.
After the simple vowels comes the group of four vowels, i.e. e, o, ai, and au.
These four are generally called sandhyakṣaras ‘compound-vowels.’ Out of
these four, the first two are often, though not always, described as
monophthongs, while the latter two are most often explicitly called dvi-varṇa
‘consisting of two sounds,’ i.e. diphthongs. The principle of back-to-front
ordering in terms of the points of articulations is maintained even in the sub-
groups e, o, and ai, au. As we move to the category of sounds called sparśa

40 INTRODUCTION
‘contact sounds, ’ i.e. stops and nasals, we see several converging principles at
work. The five horizontal groups are each called a varga ‘group,’ i.e. k\(a\)-
varga, c\(a\)-varga, ṭ\(a\)-varga, t\(a\)-varga, and p\(a\)-varga. The vertical ordering
of these groups shows the same back-to-front ordering, with the k\(a\)-varga at
the back end of the spectrum of points of articulation and the p\(a\)-varga at the
front end of the same spectrum. The palatal, the retroflex, and the dental
groups are ordered between the velar and the labial groups. The vertical lines
intersecting these five groups show other phonetic features. The first vertical
group, i.e. k, c, ṭ, t, and p,  consists of voiceless unaspirated stops. The second
vertical group, i.e. kh, ch, ṭh, th, and ph, consists of voiceless aspirated stops.
The third vertical group, i.e. g, j, ḍ, d, and b, consists of voiced unaspirated
stops. The fourth vertical group, i.e. gh, jh, ḍh, dh, and bh, consists of voiced
aspirated stops. The fifth vertical group, i.e. ṅ, ñ, ṇ, n, and m, consists of
nasals. 
4.4.3. The order of consonants in each of the five horizontal groups
of stops and nasals is significant for other theoretical reasons as well. Desh-
pande \(1976\) shows that there were theorists who reduced the total number of
primitive sounds to a much smaller number and argued that other Sanskrit
sounds were built by combining these primitive sounds. The principal sources
of information on these ancient theories are the RPR \(13.13; 13.15\) and the
ancient Śikṣā text quoted by the Caturādhyāyībhāṣya on CA \(1.1.12\):
प्रयोक्तुरीहागुणसंनिपाते वर्णीभवन्गुणविशेषयोगात् ।
एकः श्रुतीः कर्मणाप्नोति बह्वीः ॥ ऋ.प्रा. १३.१३ ॥
“When the air \(coming up from lungs\) is associated with a spe-
cific desire of the speaker, that air, being transformed into a
sound through specific articulatory effort, attains to various

Ancient Śikṣā quoted in CAB on CA \(1.1.12\):
‘सस्थानैरूष्मभिः पृक्तास्तृतीयाः प्रथमाश्च ये ।

“The thirds and the firsts, combined with homorganic spirants,
become the fourths and the seconds. Such is the decision.
Another phonetician says: The fourth is \[derived\] through a
combination with h. Some scholars say that there are only five
stops, i.e. the firsts \[of the respective series\]. They are trans-
formed into other sounds through their acquisition of different
properties. \[The firsts, i.e. k, c, ṭ, t, and p\], combined respec-
tively with these factors, i.e. ḫ \(= jihvāmūlīya\), ś, ṣ, s, and ẖ \(=
upadhmānīya\), are known as the seconds, \[i.e. kh, ch, ṭh, th,
and ph\]. The same \[firsts\], when combined with voice \(ghoṣa\),
are known as the thirds, \[i.e. g, j, ḍ, d, and b\]. \[When the thirds
are further\] combined with a second element, a spirant, they are
known as the fourths, \[i.e. gh, jh, ḍh, dh, and bh\]. When the
firsts, combined with voice, are nasalized, they are known as
the fifths, \[i.e. ṅ, ñ, ṇ, n, and m\]. Thus, the properties of the
sounds are traditionally recounted.”
Thus, for instance, in the series k, kh, g, gh, and ṅ, the first consonant k
is deemed to be a primitive consonant. By adding the voiceless velar aspi-
ration, i.e. ḫ \(jihvāmūlīya\), to the primitive k, one derives the voiceless aspirate
stop kh. It is important to note that the aspirated stops are called soṣman ‘fused
with a spirant’ in Sanskrit indicating their compound nature in terms of these
early phonetic theories. My best guess is that this theory developed after the
period of the Aitareya-Āraṇyaka, which knows the term ūṣman, but not
soṣman. The latter is obviously derived from the former, and hence comes
after the former, at least logically, if not also chronologically. Similarly, the

42 INTRODUCTION
sound g is derived by adding the primitive voice \(ghoṣa\) a to the primitive
consonant k. Thus, naturally, the category of voiced consonants is called
ghoṣavat ‘with voice,’ indicating that the feature of voice is also looked at as an
add-on feature. The sound gh is derived by adding the voiced aspiration h to k.
The final nasal of the series, i.e. ṅ, is derived by adding the primitive voiced
nasal ṃ \(anusvāra\) to the primitive consonant k. Thus, the order of these
consonants represents the results of prior theoretical considerations which are
explicitly discussed in texts like the RPR and the ancient Śikṣā quoted in the
CAB \(Deshpande 1976\). 
4.4.4. After these ‘contact’ sounds, the alphabet lists the semi-vowels
or ‘in-between-sounds’ \(antasthā / antaḥsthā\), i.e. y, r, l, and v. At the very
end are listed the spirants, ūṣman ‘aspiration sounds,’ i.e. ś, ṣ, s, and h. The
semi-vowels, i.e. y, r, l, and v, as well as the three sibilants, i.e. ś, ṣ, and s, also
exhibit the back-to-front ordering in terms of the points of articulations of the
included sounds. It seems that the phoneticians intended the final h as a
separate addition to the first three sibilants. The first three are voiceless
sibilants, while the final h, is a voiced aspiration. Most texts also add the
sounds ṃ, ḥ, ẖ, and ḫ. Among these sounds, the sounds, ḥ \(visarga\) is a
voiceless h sound. The sounds ḫ \(jihvāmūlīya\) and ẖ \(upadhmānīya\) are
variants for ḥ, before k, kh, and p, ph, respectively. The nature of the sound
represented by ṃ, the anusvāra, is highly debated in the ancient texts. The
general consensus is that it is an oral-nasal generic sound which changes to
homorganic nasals in accordance with what follows. An unchanged or un-
changeable ṃ is found only before the spirants and r. This predominant
context of spirants for the anusvāra led some texts like the RPR to include this
sound in its list of spirants \(ūṣman\). Since there was a feeling that an anusvāra
could be prolonged in length in recitation, the same text says that an anusvāra
may be considered to be either a vowel or a consonant. Most of these texts
discuss several other sounds and their features. Besides the ṃ \(= anusvāra\)
which is generally described as an oral-nasal sound, most texts also posit
another sound called nāsikya, which is deemed to be a pure nasal sound.
Additionally, most texts talk about fractional vowels, such as the ones which
go in the make-up of a vowel normally represented as r̥, i.e. ∂r∂. The phonetic
treatises also go into details of what are clearly transitional sounds. For
instance, the texts talk about a nasal gँ \(= η?\) intervening between the
consonants g and n in a word like agni. Such consonants are called Yamas.
The texts also go into details of accents \(= pitch variation\) and nasalization of
vowels, as well as three- and four-moraic vowels. According to these texts,

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 43
one can also get contextual nasal variants for all vowels, and the semi-vowels
y, v, and l, i.e. ỹ, ṽ, and l̃. 
4.5. Descriptive Techniques & Terminology
4.5.1. The descriptive and the prescriptive goal of the ancient Indian
phonetic tradition was to be able to clearly distinguish between different
sounds of Sanskrit, so that one will not be mistaken or mispronounced for
another. Verse 10 of the versified Pāṇinīyaśikṣā says: 
स्वरतः कालतः स्थानात् प्रयत्नानुप्रदानतः ।
इति वर्णविदः प्राहुर्निपुणं तन्निबोधत ॥
Sounds are distinguished from each other on the basis of accents
\(svara\), time or duration \(kāla\), point of articulation \(sthāna\), manner
\(prayatna\), and type of phonation \(anupradāna\). Here the term svara ‘accent’
refers to the pitch distinctions denoted by the terms udātta ‘high,’ anudātta
‘low,’ and svarita ‘rising-falling.’ The term kāla ‘duration’ refers to units of
time it requires to pronounce a given sound. Consonants are generally
considered to be of a half-mora \(ardha-mātrā\) length, while vowels can be of
one, two, three and four morae in length. The one-mora vowels are called
hrasva ‘short.’ The two-mora vowels are called dīrgha ‘long.’ Vowels with
three and four morae length are called pluta ‘prolonged.’ The term sthāna
‘place, point of articulation’ refers to points on the articulatory track, i.e. uras
‘chest,’ kaṇṭha ‘throat,’ jihvāmūla ‘tongue-root,’ tālu ‘hard-palate,’ mūrdhan
‘cerebrum, roof of the oral cavity,’ dantamūla ‘alveolar ridge, root of teeth,’
danta ‘teeth,’ and oṣṭha ‘lips.’ The list of points of articulation sometimes also
includes nāsikā ‘nose.’ The term prayatna ‘manner’ refers to how the physical
organ called karaṇa ‘articulator’ relates to the point of articulation, i.e. sparśa
‘contact,’ upasaṃhāra ‘approximation,’ vivr̥ta ‘open,’ etc. The term karaṇa
‘articulator’ generally refers to different parts of the tongue, such as the tip, the
middle, and the root, as well as the sides or edges and the middle. It also refers
to teeth in the case of labio-dental sounds like v, and to the lower lip in the case
of labial sounds like b. For nasalized vowels such as ã, ĩ, ũ, ẽ, and õ, the nose
is often considered to be the articulator, while for the nasal consonants ṅ, ñ, ṇ,
n, and m, the nose is considered to be the point of articulation \(Deshpande
1975: 11-12\). The texts show a great diversity of opinion on many of these
classifications \(cf. Allen 1953, Bare 1976\). The final category is that of
anupradāna ‘phonation, emission.’ Generally, there are two types of emission,

44 INTRODUCTION
i.e. śvāsa ‘breath’ and nāda ‘resonance,’ resulting from two different positions
of the glottal chords, vivr̥ta ‘open’ and saṃvr̥ta ‘close’ respectively. The
emission of the type of breath further results in voiceless sounds, while the
emission of the type of resonance further results in vowels and voiced
consonants. Some texts like the Taittirīya-Prātiśākhya claim that there is a third
type of emission called hakāra ‘the h sound, voiced aspiration’ when the glottal
chords are in a position in-between open and close, and this type combines
voice or resonance with aspiration and is termed breathy voice in modern
phonetics. This type of emission is found in the voiced spirant h, as well as in
voiced aspirate stops such as gh, jh, ḍh, dh, and bh. The ancient Indian texts
use two different terms, nāda and ghoṣa to refer to voicing. We are often told
that the feature of nāda is shared by vowels and ghoṣavat consonants, lit.
consonants possessed of ghoṣa, voiced consonants. Modern scholars have
debated the question of whether or not this refers to two different types of
resonance. Some have suggested that the distinction has no articulatory basis,
but that it is phonologically motivated. Others have suggested a possible
articulatory basis, namely that the first, i.e. nāda, is produced by the closure of
glottal chords, and that the secondary amplification, i.e. ghoṣa, is produced by a
closure in the oral chamber created by the contact between the articulator and
the point of articulation \(cf. Deshpande 1976, Cardona 1983\). 
4.5.2. Certain features are considered as plus/minus features in
ancient Indian phonetics, while others are considered as more/less features.
The terms ghoṣavat \(voiced\) and aghoṣa \(voiceless\) indicate that the feature of
ghoṣa ‘voice’ is a plus/minus feature. On the other hand, the feature of
aspiration, especially when designated by the term prāṇa, appears as a
more/less feature. The sounds which are called unaspirated in Western ter-
minology are called alpaprāṇa ‘with less prāṇa,’ while the aspirated sounds are
called mahāprāṇa ‘with greater prāṇa.’ Similarly, the notion of prayatna ‘effort,
manner’ is expressed in some texts in binary terms spr̥ṣṭa/aspr̥ṣṭa ‘with or
without contact between the articulator and the point of articulation,’ while in
other texts, this notion is expressed in terms of degrees of openness and
contact i.e. vivr̥ta ‘open,’ īṣadvivr̥ta ‘slightly open,’ vivr̥tatara ‘more open,’ and
vivr̥tatama ‘most open,’ spr̥ṣṭa ‘in contact,’ and īṣatspr̥ṣṭa ‘in slight contact.’
4.6. What is distinctive?
4.6.1. Several scholars have devoted their attention to a possible
distinction between phonetics and phonology in the context of the ancient
traditions of Sanskrit phonetics and grammar \(cf. Deshpande 1975, Bare 1976,

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 45
Cardona 1983\). Often the term varṇa is translated with the term ‘phoneme’ in
modern expositions of Sanskrit phonetics. The Sanskrit grammarians do
indeed discuss minimum pairs like kūpa/sūpa/yūpa. However, the term varṇa
does not strictly refer to a phoneme in modern linguistics. For Sanskrit
phoneticians, the sounds n and ñ are distinct varṇas, while they would be only
allophones for a modern linguist. On the contrary, the sounds a and ā would
be separate phonemes for a modern linguist, but they belong to the same varṇa
for Sanskrit phoneticians and grammarians. On the other hand, the Sanskrit
phoneticians and grammarians do indeed have a notion that certain features of
sounds are relevant in some descriptive contexts, while they are not relevant in
other contexts. Kātyāyana in his comments on Pāṇini’s grammar often brings
up the notion that the features \(guṇa, quality\) of accent \(svara\), nasality
\(ānunāsikya\), and duration \(kāla\) are distinctive \(bhedaka\), See: Deshpande
\(1975: 50ff; 203, note 442; 207, note 466\). According to the fully developed
phonetico-grammatical doctrines of Sanskrit grammarians, the term avarṇa
refers to the whole family \(e.g. avarṇa-kula\) of the following eighteen sounds:
a, ā, ā3, á, ā́, ā́3, à, ā̀, ā̀3, ã, ā̃, ā̃3, ã́, ā̃́, ā̃́3, ã̀, ā̃̀, ā̃̀3.
4.6.2. The distinctions of length, accent, and nasality are not relevant
for inclusion in a varṇa. On the other hand, the term akāra refers to the six
tokens of short a differing in accent and nasality, but not in length. The
grammarian-phoneticians knew that in formulating some rules of sandhi, they
could achieve maximum descriptive economy by resorting to the varṇa
groupings, while for other rules, the -kāra grouping seemed more economical,
and for still other rules, one needed to make a highly specific reference to a
token with a specific length, nasality, accent etc. The grammarian-phoneticians
make several important distinctions in their terminology. For instance, two
sound tokens are sarūpa ‘with identical phonetic shape,’ if and only if they
have all identical phonetic features, including length, nasality, accents, etc.
Two vowel-tokens are grouped in the same x-kāra group, if they have the same
point of articulation, articulator, manner, and quantity. They could differ in
nasality and accent, and still be part of the same x-kāra group. Two sounds are
savarṇa ‘homogeneous’ with each other if they share the same point of
articulation and the same manner. These different groupings were used to
formulate different rules in Sanskrit grammar, and allowed descriptive
optimization. The notion of maximal featural proximity \(āntaratamya\) is one of
the principles used in Sanskrit grammar to determine the choice of a substitute
from among a choice of alternatives \(cf. Bare 1976, Hueckstedt 1995\).
4.6.3. The Sanskrit grammarian-phoneticians were also aware of
another distinction, i.e. that of the speed of delivery or tempo, i.e. fast, medium,

46 INTRODUCTION
and slow. These modes of recitation are discussed in Kātyāyana’s Vārttikas on
Pāṇini 1.1.70 and 1.4.109. Nāgeśabhaṭṭa, in his Uddyota \(MB, Vol. I, Pt. I, p.
378\) quotes the following verse:
अभ्यासार्थे द्रुता वृत्तिः प्रयोगार्थे तु मध्यमा ।
शिष्याणामुपदेशार्थं वृत्तिरिष्टा विलम्बिता ॥
The verse says that different modes of delivery were considered to be
appropriate for different contexts. The fast speed is supposed to be used when
a person is reciting the mantras for his own study. In the ritual use of the
mantras, one is supposed to use the medium speed. A teacher is supposed to
use the slow speed to recite the mantras while teaching his students. Using an
inappropriate speed at the wrong occasion creates unacceptable situations, and
in this sense, the speed or tempo is a distinctive feature at this level. However,
these differences of tempo had no euphonic or grammatical value. This has
been clearly recognized by Kātyāyana in his Vārttika: siddhaṃ tv avasthitā
varṇā vaktuś cirāciravacanād vr̥ttayo viśiṣyante, MB \(Kielhorn edn.\), Vol.I, p.
181. Further they noticed that a consonant such as k seemed to acquire a
certain degree of voicing in intervocalic positions, but that it was not to be
distinguished from the generic k for all practical purposes.
4.6.4. In the work of Bhartr̥hari, the grammarian-philosopher of ±
500 A.D., we find a new representation of these different levels of distinctive-
ness. These different levels of distinctiveness are seen in terms of a production
model. There is a notion that there are ontologically eternal true sounds
\(sphoṭa, varṇa\) which are temporally manifested by the physical sounds of two
kinds, primary physical sounds \(prākr̥ta-dhvani\) and secondary physical
sounds \(vaikr̥ta-dhvani\). There are several different views found in
Bhartr̥hari’s Vākyapadīya and in his commentary on Patañjali’s MB regarding
the relationship between the real sounds, the primary physical sounds, and the
secondary physical sounds, and these have been ably discussed in detail by
S.D. Joshi \(1967: 20-34\). For our present purpose, suffice it to say that the
level of sphoṭa ‘true sound,’ in general, seems to reflect only the features of
point of articulation, manner, voicing, aspiration, etc., but not duration or
tempo. The sphoṭa level is said to be beyond temporality, while the primary
manifesting sounds have the feature of duration or length. The secondary
manifesting sounds, which are further reverberations of the primary
manifesting sounds, reveal the feature of tempo. Thus, in general, we get
concentric circles representing different features. As a production model, I do
not think Bhartr̥hari’s ideas will rank very high in the evaluation of modern

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 47
phoneticians. On the other hand, the diagrammatic perception of the various
phonetic features as concentric circles moving out from more distinctive to less
distinctive offers an interesting view of these features and deserves to be
explored further. 
5. Phonetics vs Phonology in Indian 
Grammatical Tradition
5.1. ‘Phonetics’ versus ‘Phonology’ in Modern 
Linguistics
5.1.1. There are a number of distinctions made explicitly in modern
linguistics for which there are no exact parallels in the traditions of Sanskrit
Śikṣās, Prātiśākhyas, and Vyākaraṇa. One such distinction is that between the
categories of ‘phonetic’ versus ‘phonemic’, or to use a more recent term,
‘phonological’. Both phonetics and phonology, in their various brands and
branches as practiced in modern linguistics, represent a study of the sound
system of a given language. Without getting into too many technicalities, we
can describe the difference between these two allied fields in the following
way. Phonetics aims at studying the articulatory and the acoustic processes
involved in the production of the sounds used by a given language. The very
basic material which is being studied may be called phonic material, i.e. the
sounds of a language as they are produced and perceived. The next level of
understanding may be reached in what may be called phonemic. At this level,
an analyst may be looking for features which are distinctive in some sense.
The notion of ‘phoneme’ in structural linguistics attempted to come to grips
with this question. There may be two instances of the phonic material which
may be different in some respect, and yet may be perceived by both the speaker
and the listener as being two instances of the same sound. This kind of an
approach leads the analyst to distinguish between differences among the
sounds which matter, and the differences which do not matter. Now the whole
notion of what matters is a complex notion in itself and later we shall explore
this complexity in some detail. At this point, suffice it to say that the traditional
notion of ‘phoneme’ dealt with one such level of what matters, and came up
with a concept that for a given language, there was a fixed inventory of
distinctive sounds. This lead the structural linguists to work on determining
such inventories for various languages, and to debate whether a given phone or

48 INTRODUCTION
sound-instance was an independent phoneme, or merely an allophone, a
contextual variant of a phoneme. Eventually, the emphasis on inventories of
phonemes, and the debate on a semi-metaphysical question of whether such
phonemes exist, gave way to a study of what came to be known as distinctive
features. The sounds came to be viewed as bundles of features, some of which
were viewed as being distinctive in some sense. The emphasis on the
discovery of phonemes then shifted to the determination of a set of distinctive
features for a given language. The next level of understanding of the sounds of
a language is reached in a branch of linguistics which is now generally called
phonology. In terms of the current state of the science of linguistics, the
branch of phonemics is very much dead, while the branches of phonetics and
phonology are very much alive and prospering. What does phonology deal
with? Phonology deals with the study of relationships between the sounds and
features of these sounds as part of a system. It focuses on the behavior of
sounds in relation to each other, and investigates the questions of how the
behavior of sounds can be described in the form of predictable rules. Such
rules may make use of various groupings of sounds, their features etc., and can
be formulated at increasingly abstract levels. Phonetics and phonology may be
studied both in synchronic as well as diachronic aspects. In both such
approaches, one can raise the question of not only ‘how’ the sounds behave,
but go further and raise the question of ‘why’ the sounds behave in a particular
way. The answer to the question of ‘why’ may then be given in various
different ways. For a given pattern of behavior of sounds, the answer may lie
in the current phonetic features of those sounds, or such a behavior of sounds
may simply reflect an inherited pattern of behavior, not fully justifiable in terms
of the current features of the given sounds. This leads to some interesting and
important possibilities. It is relatively easy to see that phonological groupings
of sounds may be motivated by the phonetic features of the given sounds.
However, one cannot discount the possibility and the probability that the
phonological behavior of sounds may in some cases lead sounds with
originally divergent phonetic features to move closer to a more homogeneous
phonetic character.
5.1.2. The tradition of Sanskrit phonetics represented in the Śikṣās,
Prātiśākhyas, and Sanskrit Grammars clearly does not have any interest in the
historical study of Sanskrit, and hence one cannot find any explicit discussions
in this tradition in this regard. At the same time, one need not assume that this
tradition has been left untouched by the history of the language itself.
Similarly, even though the tradition has no explicit separate terms for what we
call phonetics and phonology in modern linguistics, one need not assume that

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ  49
the ancient grammarians and phoneticians did not have some of the same
concerns. We need to look for what such concerns may have been, and the
ways in which such concerns have surfaced in the ancient literature. While we
must make every effort to make sure that we are not superimposing a modern
set of concepts on the statements of the ancient grammarians, we should leave
no stone unturned to find out the distinctions that they made, and the ones
which they did not make. A good deal of work has been done in this direction
by scholars like George Cardona, Paul Kiparsky, myself, my student James
Bare, and more recently by Robert Hueckstedt. In what follows, I shall briefly
describe the kind of research which has been going on in this field for the past
twenty some years. Many of the details, which I shall report, involve long-
standing controversies, though here I shall not proceed in a polemical fashion. 
5.2. ‘Varṇa’ versus ‘Phoneme’
5.2.1. In modern expositions of Sanskrit grammar and phonetics,
especially the ones coming from India, there has been a tendency to use the
term ‘phoneme’ to render the Sanskrit term varṇa. Whatever the historical
origins of the term varṇa, and we shall not deal with that question here, the
term has been used with a wide latitude of reference in Sanskrit literature.
Perhaps the term varṇa is very much like the English term ‘letter,’ making an
oblique reference to the art of writing. The widest possible meaning of the
term varṇa is ‘sound, letter.’ In this wide sense, it appears in expressions like
varṇa-samāmnāya, where it seems to be identical in meaning with the term
akṣara, cf. akṣara-samāmnāya. If the term varṇa refers to sounds listed in the
traditional Sanskrit alphabet, including the often unlisted sounds \(ayogavāhas\),
e.g. ṃ and ḥ, can this use of the term varṇa be identical in meaning with the
sense of the term ‘phoneme’ in structural linguistics? Most of the sounds
listed in the Sanskrit alphabet do qualify for the term ‘phoneme,’ but not all. In
order that a sound should qualify for the term ‘phoneme,’ we must have
minimal pairs of words which differ in just one sound. Patañjali’s kūpa / sūpa
/ yūpa analysis does look similar to the analysis with minimal pairs in structural
linguistics. However, the fact is that for sounds like ḥ, ṅ, ñ, ḫ, and ẖ, we
cannot find minimal pairs in Sanskrit. For example, we have the pair bhāna /
bhāṇa, where the change of just one sound produces another word with a
distinct meaning. Through analysis like this, we can conclude that the Sanskrit
alphabet includes some varṇas which are not phonemes, but are allophones in
modern terminology. Why were such sounds considered to be varṇas? Here,
the distinctive background of the Sanskrit phonetic tradition must be fully

50 INTRODUCTION
appreciated. There seem to be two possible reasons for treating a sound like ñ
to be a separate varṇa. The first reason seems to be that the distinction of
allophones versus phonemes is foreign to the Indian tradition. The Indian
tradition was also a prayoga-śāstra ‘a science of performance,’ and obviously it
did desire that a reciter should pronounce ñ, where it was required, and should
not mispronounce it as n, or ṇ. Even if there are no minimal pairs for ñ, every
Vaidika knows that ñ must be distinguished from other sounds in recitation.
Secondly, the phoneme-allophone analysis applies when we are taking into
account only one language at a time. Several Śikṣās, including the more
popular Pāṇinīyaśikṣā \(v. 3\), say: त्रिषष्टिः चतुःषष्टिर्वा वर्णाः शम्भुमते मताः । संस्कृते
प्राकृते चापि ।, “In the opinion of Śiva, there are 63 or 64 sounds in Sanskrit as
well as in Prakrit.” Besides the initial uncertainty about the exact number of
varṇas, the verse clearly points out that these are the varṇas for both Sanskrit
and Prakrit together. In Prakrit we can find minimal pairs involving ñ, e.g.
ñāṇa versus nāṇa\(ka\). Such a pair may make ñ a legitimate phoneme for
Prakrit. For Indian phoneticians, ñ was simply distinct from n, ṇ, and ṅ. Thus,
the notion of phoneme must be distinguished from that of varṇa. We must
appreciate the similarities as well as the differences.
5.3. ‘Varṇa,’ ‘Varga,’ and ‘Savarṇa’
5.3.1. Now we can move to a narrower, and a more technical usage
of the word varṇa. In this narrow usage, the word -varṇa is distinguished from
-kāra. The word varṇa, when affixed to a short vowel, e.g. i-varṇa, stands for
the whole class of i-sounds differing in length, accents, and nasality. Patañjali
uses the term a-varṇa-kula for such a class. Thus, there is a-varṇa, but not ā-
varṇa, ai-varṇa, ka-varṇa, or ya-varṇa. Instead of these, we have ā-kāra, ai-
kāra, ka-kāra, and ya-kāra. The term a-kāra is also a generalization in that it
refers to varieties of short a, which may differ in accent and nasality. For the
groups of stops, one could not use the term varṇa, but one called the group of
k, kh, g, gh, and ṅ, by the term ka-varga. In older works like the Śikṣās and
the Prātiśākhyas, membership within a varṇa-group, or a varga-group was
generally defined simply by listing the sounds, cf. द्वे द्वे सवर्णे ह्रस्वदीर्घे, TPR \(1.3\),
also: Deshpande \(1975: 85ff\). This is generally the meaning of the term
savarṇa in the Śikṣās and the Prātiśākhyas, i.e. these sounds belong to the same
varṇa. The term kavarga was defined by just picking out the first item of the
list and saying: this is the k- class.

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ  51
5.4. From Definitions by Listing to Featural Definitions
5.4.1. As we move from the Śikṣās and the Prātiśākhyas to Pāṇini,
we see a qualitative difference in the way the groupings of sounds are defined.
Here, there are two modes of defining groups. The first way is to make
shortforms \(pratyāhāras\) based on the listings in the Śivasūtras. The second
way is to access members of a group through the procedure called
savarṇagrahaṇa ‘accessing a class of savarṇas by referring to a single token.’
While the Śikṣās and the Prātiśākhyas defined the phonetic features of Sanskrit
sounds, it was Pāṇini who showed a superior ability to define groupings of
sounds in terms of their phonetic features. This is how his definition of
savarṇa differs significantly from the definitions found in most of the
Prātiśākhyas: P.1.1.9 \(तुल्यास्यप्रयत्नं सवर्णम्\). The rule says that any two sounds
are called savarṇas of each other if and only if they share the same āsya-
prayatna ‘oral effort.’ The term āsyaprayatna was eventually interpreted as
referring to two features: sthāna ‘place of articulation’ and ābhyantara-prayatna
‘internal effort,’ i.e. the manner in which the karaṇa or the articulator was
related to the place of articulation.’ Pāṇini himself did not specify the phonetic
categories he had in mind, although the later Pāṇinian commentators have
provided those details for us. Here we shall not go into the question of
whether the later Pāṇinian tradition has given us historically reliable phonetic
classifications for Pāṇini. In any case, this single generalization in Pāṇini
covered the two separate notions in the Prātiśākhyas, i.e. savarṇa and savarga.
Once this was accomplished, Pāṇini introduced his general and limited
procedure of savarṇagrahaṇa through his rules P.1.1.69 \(अणुदित् सवर्णस्य
चाप्रत्ययः\) and P.1.1.70 \(तपरस्तत्कालस्य\). In terms of the progress of linguistic
theory, this indeed marked an advance.
5.5. Problems of the New Phonology in Pāṇini
5.5.1. The new featural definition of savarṇa in Pāṇini, and the
procedure of savarṇagrahaṇa, achieved new theoretical success, and yet in the
wake of this success, it brought with it new problems, which the Prātiśākhyas
were generally not faced with. I shall mention here two such problems. The
phonetic features assumed by Pāṇini were such that the vowels and the spirants
\(ś, ṣ, s, and h\) had the same prayatna, i.e. the degree of closure or openness
between the articulator and the place of articulation. This would have made
some vowels savarṇas of some consonants, and the procedure of
savarṇagrahaṇa would have allowed a vowel to stand for its consonantal

52 INTRODUCTION
savarṇa. Pāṇini did recognize the possibility of such undesired over-extension
of the notion of savarṇa, and to prevent it, he formulated his rule P.1.1.10
\(नाज्झलौ\). In general terms, the rule is supposed to say that vowels cannot be
savarṇas with consonants. This shows the limitations of featural groupings for
functional purposes. In spite of the common phonetic features, vowels and
consonants must be grouped apart from each other. On the other hand,
consider the opposite problem with a and ā. Traditionally, ā was described as
an open \(vivr̥ta\) sound, while a was described as a close \(saṃvr̥ta\) sound.
Thus, their prayatna being different from each other, they would not become
savarṇas of each other, and then they cannot be grouped together. To get over
this problem, Pāṇini apparently pronounced an open short a throughout his
grammar, which was restored to a close short a by the last rule of his grammar,
i.e. P.8.4.68 \(अ अ\). This made these two sounds technically savarṇas of each
other throughout his grammar, and only the very last rule, invisible to the rest
of the grammar, restored it to its true pronunciation. There is a moral to this
story. Sounds with common phonetic features can have a different functional
load, and sounds with different phonetic features may have the same functional
load. This same result has been achieved by some texts by using terms like
savarṇavat. In the later Pāṇinian tradition, the sounds r̥ and l̥ were legislated to
be each other’s savarṇas in spite of the difference in their phonetic features \(cf.
Vārttika 4 on P. 1.1.10: ऋकारऌकारयोः सवर्णविधिः\).
5.6. Varṇarūpa versus Varṇākr̥ti: From Phonetic Features
to Metaphysics
5.6.1. If the difference between the Śikṣās and Prātiśākhyas3 on the
one hand and Pāṇini on the other can be caracterized as a move from groupings
by listing to groupings by features, especially in the context of the notion of
savarṇa, the difference between Pāṇini and Kātyāyana may be characterized as
a move from featural phonology to metaphysical phonology. To describe this
move briefly, we can say that for Pāṇini, the sounds listed in the Śivasūtras
stand for themselves to begin with, and they stand for their savarṇa class only
as a result of the procedure of savarṇagrahaṇa. As we have seen before,
membership to the class of savarṇa is controlled by the featural definition of the
class given by P.1.1.9 \(तुल्यास्यप्रयत्नं सवर्णम्\). Where the procedure of
savarṇagrahaṇa does not apply, the given sound stands just for itself. The
basic notion of a sound standing for ‘itself’ is expressed by Pāṇini through the

3 This is a broad generalization about this literature, and has specific exceptions which may be
post-Paninian, e.g. the Vājasaneyi-Prātiśākhya.

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 53
term rūpa ‘phonetic shape’ of a sound, and this notion has been incorporated in
expressions like sarūpa, asarūpa, and in the fundamental rule P.1.1.68 \(स्वं रूपं
शब्दस्याशब्दसंज्ञा\). Thus, the form of a word is basically viewed by Pāṇini in
terms of its phonetic shape. Moving away from this featural phonology of
Pāṇini, Kātyāyana, perhaps under the influence of the emerging philosophical
schools such as those of Vājapyāyana and Vyāḍi, proposes a new brand of
metaphysical phonology. This proposal says that one should assume that the
listing of the Śivasūtras is not a listing of tokens, but a listing of sound-genera
or ākr̥tis, which would naturally represent a whole class sharing a given ākr̥ti,
without any special rules. If such is the case, then one does not need a large
part of the Pāṇinian procedure of savarṇagrahaṇa: Vt. सवर्णेऽण्ग्रहणमपरिभाष्य-
माकृतिग्रहणात्, on P.1.1.69. This proposal of Kātyāyana, which I have dis-
cussed at length in Deshpande \(1975: 17-31\), is fraught with difficulties. I
shall briefly mention the following:
1\) A metaphysical definition of ākr̥ti of a sound becomes impression-
istic in terms of one’s ability to identify its membership.
2\) Generally any member covered by an ākr̥ti would be able to stand
for the whole class. This obliterates the distinction between sounds
directly listed in the Śivasūtras, i.e. the aṆ sounds, and the sounds not
directly listed in the Śivasūtras, i.e. the non-aṆ sounds.
3\) The procedure of ākr̥tigrahaṇa cannot completely replace the
Pāṇinian procedure of savarṇagrahaṇa. This is so, because the ākr̥ti of i
can cover ī, but the ākr̥ti of k does not cover kh, g, gh, and ṅ. This is
admitted by Kātyāyana, who suggests that even after accepting the
procedure of ākr̥tigrahaṇa, one would still need the procedure of
savarṇagrahaṇa to cover these vargas of consonants. 
Thus, in general the metaphysical phonology proposed by Kātyāyana
has been relatively ineffective and in the later Pāṇinian tradition, there are few
supporters for it.
5.7. Phonetics versus Behavior: The Case of 
Sandhyakṣaras
5.7.1. The treatment of the Sanskrit sandhyakṣaras in the Indian
tradition is illustrative of several other important points. The sounds e, o, ai,

54 INTRODUCTION
and au are all generally called sandhyakṣaras in Sanskrit texts, implying that the
tradition views them as composit sounds in some sense. However, very few
texts suggest that all these sounds have distinct components. Generally, the
older texts treat the sounds e and o as monophthongs, and ascribe a single
point of articulation to these sounds, even while treating them as sandhy-
akṣaras. On the other hand, all texts treat the sounds ai and au as diphthongs.
The older texts explicitly call these sounds dvivarṇa ‘consisting of two
sounds,’ and ascribe to them two points of articulation. However, at the same
time, these older texts are quick to point out that for all practical purposes these
sounds, i.e. ai and au, are to be treated as if they are single sounds \(CA 1.1.40:
सन्ध्यक्षराणि संस्पृष्टवर्णान्येकवर्णवद् वृत्तिः\). These sounds behave as if they are single
sounds. They do not constitute two syllables either for metrical or grammatical
purposes, and phonologically behave as long vowels, rather than as sequences
of short vowels. This phonological behavior of these two diphthongs as
monophthongs has sometimes clouded even the supposedly phonetic
description of these sounds. Several texts tell us that the sounds e and o are
vivr̥tatara, the sounds ai and au are vivr̥tatama, and the sound ā is still more
open. If the sounds ai and au are phonetically dvivarṇa sounds, it makes no
sense to say that they are even more open than e and o. To my mind, the above
statement reflects a confusion caused by the lack of proper discrimination
between the phonetic and the phonological levels, and the superimposition of
one level upon the other. We shall later look at some other cases where the
phonological behavior may have colored the phonetic classifications in Sanskrit
texts.
5.8. Sthāna versus Karaṇa: The Case of V
5.8.1. The featural phonology brings with it the responsibility to
explicitly define and specify a finite set of phonetic features for the sounds of a
language. Any lack of clarity in the description of the phonological system in
this regard can lead to problems which were not faced by those who practiced
groupings by listing. As an example, consider the case of the sound v. Most
of the older Śikṣās and Prātiśākhyas list v among the oṣṭhya ‘labial’ sounds
without any further comment. These texts must be distinguished from those
texts which further specify that the karaṇa ‘articulator’ for v is the ‘tips of
teeth’ \(cf. VPR 1.81\). If the teeth or their tips are only a karaṇa for v, we can
still consider v to be an oṣṭhya sound, since such terms as oṣṭhya are seen as
always referring to the point of articulation and not the articulator. The texts
which come still later, such as the versified Pāṇinīyaśikṣā say that v is a

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ  55
dantyoṣṭhya sound. Since many of these late texts pay little attention to the
notion of karaṇa, the subsequent tradition has interpreted this term to mean that
the sound v has two points of articulation. This sound is dantya as well as
oṣṭhya, and, therefore, it should be included in both categories. What was
Pāṇini’s own intention? He has remained silent on the details of the phonetic
features, and has left it to his successors to worry about the problems caused
by his silence. Consider, for instance, the rule P.7.3.73 \(लुग्वा दुहदिहलिहगुहा-
मात्मनेपदे दन्त्ये\). The rule says that after the listed roots, the affix -ksa- of the
aorist is optionally \(or preferably, if one accepts Kiparsky’s interpretation of
vā\) deleted before a middle termination beginning in a dantya sound. The
affixes -dhvam and -ta are undoubtedly dantya-initial affixes. However, the
affix -vahi raises doubts. Is it a dantya-initial affix, or is it not? If the teeth
functioned only as karaṇa for v, then it is not a dantya sound, since the term
dantya should properly refer only to the point of articulation. However, the
KV, relying upon the late phonetic texts says that since v is a dantyoṣṭha
sound, it must be included among dantya sounds, as well as among oṣṭhya
sounds \(cf. दन्त्योष्ठ्योऽपि वकारो दन्त्य इति गृह्यते, KV on P.7.3.73\). This leads to
the derivation of forms like aduhvahi, as well as adhukṣāvahi. Whether this
statement is historically accurate is a major question. This question has been
debated elsewhere in detail, cf. Cardona 1964, Deshpande 1975a and 1981.
Suffice it to say that the choice of going for featural phonology requires a
degree of precision which is sometimes lacking in the Sanskrit texts, and this
lack of precision may have contributed to a certain degree of confusion.
Similar confusion is also noticeable on the exact status of nāsikā ‘nose.’
5.9. Āntaratamya versus Yathāsaṃkhya: The Case of iko 
yaṇ aci
5.9.1. In the last several years, a major discussion has taken place
among scholars such as myself, George Cardona, and recently, Robert
Hueckstedt. This question revolves around the use of the principle of
āntaratamya ‘maximal featural proximity’ stated in P.1.1.50 \(स्थानेऽन्तरतमः\)
versus the principle of yathāsaṃkhya ‘one-to-one substitution’ stated in
P.1.3.10 \(यथासंख्यमनुदेशः समानाम्\) in deciding appropriate substitutions in some
rules of Pāṇini. There are cases of substitution like P.3.4.101 \(तस्थस्थमिपां
तान्तन्तामः\) where it is beyond doubt that the substitution must be made on the
basis of yathāsaṃkhya. This rule says that tas, thas, tha, and miP are replaced
by tām, tam, ta and am, respectively. Similarly, there are cases like P.8.4.53
\(झलां जश् झशि\), where we must apply the principle of maximal featural

56 INTRODUCTION
proximity or āntaratamya. This rule says that jhaL sounds are replaced with
jaŚ sounds, before jhaŚ sounds. The group referred to by jhaL includes the
consonants jh, bh, gh, ḍh, dh, kh, ph, ch, ṭh, th, c, ṭ, t, k, p, ś, ṣ, s and h. On
the other hand, the substitutes denoted by the shortform jaŚ include j, b, g, ḍ
and d. The unequal number of originals and substitutes makes it an ideal
candidate for the application of the principle of maximal featural proximity.
However, rules like P.6.1.77 \(इको यणचि\) raise difficult questions. Here, the
originals are denoted by the shortform iK, while the substitutes are denoted by
yaṆ. hese shortforms are expanded just to i, u, r̥, l̥, and y, v, r, l,
respectively, then one can think of the possibility of one-to-one substitution.
However, in order to make sure that the rule would also apply to the change of
ī to y , one must expand the list of originals to cover all the homogeneous
varieties of i, u, r̥ and l̥, by P.1.1.69 \(अणुदित्सवर्णस्य चाप्रत्ययः\). If this is done
before effecting the substitution, then one gets unequal numbers of originals
and substitutes, and one needs to use the principle of maximal featural prox-
imity. On P.1.1.50, Patañjali \(MB, Kielhorn edn., Vol.I., p. 10\) says that the
problems of P.6.1.77 can be resolved even with yathāsaṃkhya : संख्यातानु-
देशेनाप्येतत्सिद्धम्. However, on P.1.3.10 \(यथासंख्यमनुदेशः समानाम्\), he says \(MB,
Kielhorn edn., Vol.I., p. 267\) that the problems of P.6.1.77 can be resolved
even with āntaratamya : स्थानेऽन्तरतमेनाप्येतत्सिद्धम्. Are there four originals and
four substitutes, or is the number of original and substitutes different? This
depends upon when exactly we apply savarṇagrahaṇa to ik and yaṇ. Recently,
Robert Hueckstedt has published a monograph that reviews the long traditional
debate relating to the interpretation of P.6.1.77, and I believe the final
conclusion regarding Pāṇini’s own intention, if there is one, is still elusive.
This example demonstrates that in using listings and features, Pāṇinian
grammar at times lacks sufficient clarity, and this has lead to such as-yet-
unresolved problems.
5.10. Did Phonology influence Phonetics? The Case of r̥ 
and r.
5.10.1. Earlier I have mentioned the case of ai and au which are
simultaneously described as being dvivarṇa ‘composed of two constituent
sounds,’ and yet being vivr̥tatama, i.e. even more open that e and o. In my
view, this situation has occurred either because these sounds are phonetically
diphthongs, but phonologically behave as single sounds, or because the
conception of these sounds as dvivarṇa is the inherited doctrine, while, at least
dialectally, these sounds have been reduced to monophthongal pronunciation

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 57
similar to vowels in the English words at and all. Since the levels of phonetics
and phonology were not sufficiently distinguished, the statements in the texts
leave room for speculation.
Such discrepancies are also found as regards the sounds r and r̥. The
older texts generally consider r̥ as a jihvāmūlīya ‘velar’ sound, and r as a
dantamūlīya ‘alveolar’ sound. The undoubtedly retroflex sounds are ṣ, and the
ṭavarga. However, notice the fact that the same old texts also specify that a
dental n coming after r, r̥, or ṣ is retroflexed. This would seem to show that a
dantamūlīya ‘alveolar,’ a jihvāmūlīya ‘velar,’ and a mūrdhanya ‘retroflex’ have
the same phonological function, i.e. they are cerebralizers, though not all
cerebrals themselves. Perhaps such a statement was gradually viewed as being
inappropriate, and the later texts started calling r and r̥ also mūrdhanya
‘retroflex’ sounds. Most modern scholars still wonder how these sounds can
be phonetically retroflex. It is thus possible that in this case the phonological
behavior of sounds has led the ancient phoneticians and grammarians to
reclassify the phonetic categories of the concerned sounds to remove the
seeming inconsistencies.
Such may also be the case of the oral effort for vowels and spirants.
Most ancient works, including Pāṇini, seem to hold that vowels and spirants
are all vivr̥ta ‘open.’ Precisely for this reason, Pāṇini had to formulate his rule
P.1.1.10 \(nājjhalau\) to prevent the impending sāvarṇya ‘homogeneity’ between
vowels and spirants. This rule, to say the least, has created enormous
problems of interpretation. To get over these, Patañjali, among others,
proposed to differentiate the oral effort for vowels from that of the spirants.
The vowels were now classified as ‘open’ \(vivr̥ta\), while the spirants were
classified as ‘slightly open’ \(īṣad-vivr̥ta\). Whether such a distinction is
phonetically justified is not clear. However, this distinction certainly made the
phonological statements clearer, and seems to have been greeted with joy by
the later grammarians, even at the cost of having to sacrifice P.1.1.10
\(nājjhalau\), cf. Nāgeśabhaṭṭa’s statement:
यदि तु सूत्रवृत्त्यादिषु श्रद्धाजाड्यमपहाय प्रयत्नभेदादेवैतद्व्यावर्त्त्य-
सावर्ण्यादीनां न सावर्ण्यमित्युच्यते, तदा सन्तु सप्त प्रयत्नाः, मास्तु च
नाज्झलाविति सूत्रम् ।,
Br̥hacchabdenduśekhara, vol. I., p. 48.
“If, however, having set aside the inertia caused by one’s trust
in the Sūtras, commentaries etc., one can say that there is no
homogeneity \[between sounds like i and ś\], whose homo-
geneity P.1.1.10 aims to prohibit, on the basis of a difference in

58 INTRODUCTION
their articulatory effort, then, \[by all means\], let there be seven
\[distinct\] articulatory efforts, and let there not be the rule
P.1.1.10.
5.11. Nāda versus Ghoṣa: Phonetic and/or Phonological?
5.11.1. Another such debate which has kept modern scholars busy
revolves around the terms nāda and ghoṣa. Most ancient texts clearly define
nāda as a type of phonation produced when the glottal chords are closed. The
vibration produced by the closed glottal chords is called nāda. All voiced
sounds have it, including vowels and voiced consonants. Now consider the
term ghoṣa. Hardly any text defines how ghoṣa is produced. However, they
all use the terms ghoṣavat, ghoṣin, and aghoṣa, implying at the very least that
ghoṣa is a certain feature which some sounds have, and others do not. What
complicates the debate is the fact that most older texts say that nāda is the
phonation for vowels and ghoṣavat consonants. This possibly suggests that
ghoṣa is a feature only for some consonants, but not for vowels. 
5.11.2. This last statement is the beginning of the whole controversy.
Some scholars have followed up the above conclusion and have attempted to
identify what ghoṣa as a separate voicing feature may have meant, cf. Desh-
pande \(1976\). Cardona \(1986\) has argued for a different view. I cannot do
justice to his extensive treatment of this question here, but to state his conclu-
sion in his own words \(p. 79-80\): “Though ghoṣavat \(‘voiced’\) and aghoṣa
\(‘voiceless’\) might at first blush seem to be purely phonetic class names, the
use of these terms with reference to voiced and voiceless consonants alone is
based on a phonological distinction.” 
5.11.3. I tend to believe that for the ancient phoneticians, ghoṣa was
also a phonetic term, which may then have had phonological uses as pointed
out by Cardona. Whether modern phonetics can identify two types or degrees
of voicing need not decide whether the ancient phoneticians viewed ghoṣa to be
a phonetic feature of sound, cf. RPR 13.15 \(आहुर्घोषं घोषवतामकारमेकेऽनुस्वार-
मनुनासिकानाम्\), RPR 13.18 \(अत्रोत्पन्नावपर ऊष्मघोषौ\) and the ancient Śikṣā quoted
by the CAB on CA \(1.1.12\). Such texts lead one to believe that the ancient
phoneticians and grammarians did indeed view ghoṣa as a varṇaguṇa which
some sounds have and others do not. Such a view is supported by the lists of
prayatnas or varṇaguṇas in various texts. Uvaṭa on RPR \(13.21\) lists ghoṣatā
and aghoṣatā as varṇaguṇas ‘features of sound.’ The grammatical texts in the
Pāṇinian tradition also list ghoṣa and aghoṣa among the bāhya-prayatnas,
besides nāda and śvāsa, and suggest that in their opinion these are phonetic

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 59
features. If one says that nāda and ghoṣa are distinct phonological features
with no distinct phonetic reality, then one could perhaps say that a lack of
clarity between the levels of phonetics and phonology may have led the
Sanskrit tradition to come up with pseudo-phonetic features in some cases. On
the other hand, this offers us an opportunity to investigate a possible distinction
in the kind of voicing involved in the articulation of vowels and voiced
consonants. I have suggested that ghoṣa may possibly refer to the
amplification or perhaps friction added to the original voicing caused by the
glottal closure in the pronunciation of voiced consonants. Such an added
amplification or friction can be attributed to the partial or complete closure of
the oral organs in the utterance of voiced consonants. For example, the
implosion for unreleased voiced stops like b feels like a form of oral vibration
distinct from the vibration of the glottal chords, and it may have been
interpreted by the ancient phoneticians as the feature of ghoṣa, distinct from
nāda ‘vibration of the glottal chords.’ Also see: Ralf Stautzebach 1994: 287.
5.12. No explicit ‘phonology’ versus ‘phonetics’
5.12.1. To reiterate my main point, the Sanskrit phonetic and gram-
matical traditions did not explicitly distinguish between the phonetic and the
phonological levels in their description. However, it is clear that they were
faced with many dilemmas in trying to correlate the phonetic features of sounds
to their phonological behavior. In doing so, sometimes they made explicit
distinctions between what we would call the phonetic character of a sound and
its phonological behavior. At other times, the phonological behavior of sounds
may have led the ancient grammarians into consciously or unconsciously
creating pseudo-phonetic distinctions to match the observed differences in
phonological behavior. In any case, the above analysis shows the promise as
well as the limitations of the science of phonetics and grammar as practiced in
ancient India.
6.Pāṇinian Impact on the Tradition of the CA
6.1. Surya Kanta’s Proposal concerning two types of 
Prātiśākhyas
6.1.1. In the introduction to his magnificent edition of the APR \(p.
24\), Surya Kanta proposed that the evolution of the Prātiśākhya literature

60 INTRODUCTION
shows that in their formative period, there were essentially two types of
Prātiśākhyas. 
Type A, represented by the APR, contained exhaustive listings
\(gaṇas\) of examples showing certain patterns of linguistic behavior, but
no generalized rules. This was the first step.
Type B, represented by the CA, containing generalizations, exceptions
to generalizations etc., but not exhaustive lists \(gaṇas\). This was the
second step.
Surya Kanta \(ibid, p. 25\) claims that “the evolution of B would throw
into abeyance A”, and that “B being descriptive would be easily reduced to the
abstract sūtra style.”
6.2. Surya Kanta’s view of the existing Prātiśākhya texts
6.2.1. We shall briefly summarize below, Surya Kanta’s more exten-
sive discussion \(ibid, pp. 25ff\):
a\) Existing Prātiśākhyas represent a mixture of the types A and B, and
there are no pure representatives of the types A and B.
b\) Surya Kanta assumes that the type A is inherently earlier than the
type B, i.e. the listings of instances were made prior to the stage of
generalizations. However, on the basis of direct quotations of the CA
rules in the APR, he admits that the CA is older than the APR.
Thus, an actual text showing generalizations is older than the text which
is primarily a set of listings. In actuality, listings are dependent on generaliza-
tions, and generalizations are dependent upon listings. 
6.3. Vedic grammar and the grammar of contemporary 
Sanskrit
6.3.1. We may observe that even the Padapāṭhas presuppose a set of
grammatical generalizations, on the basis of which the original Saṃhitā was
segmented into Padas, and occasionally into their components. The gram-
matical theory, though not clearly spelled out by the Padakāras must be

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 61
assumed to have existed, and can be inferred to a certain extent from the
Padapāṭhas, cf. V.N. Jha \(1987\).
The ancient Padapāṭha/Prātiśākhya type grammars worked under two
different pressures or had two slightly divergent targets:
i\) narrow target = to describe just the text of a particular Śākhā of a 
particular Veda
ii\) wider target = to describe the generic Sanskrit language:
Vedic and post-Vedic Sanskrit taken together.
Even the Padapāṭha manifests features of post-Vedic dialects of San-
skrit like those of Śākalya and others, cf. Cardona \(1991\), and is not free from
the implicit influence of the grammar of contemporary Sanskrit.
The narrow target of describing the texts of a particular Śākhā, in
practice could not be separated from considerations of post-Vedic Sanskrit, and
the concerns of a generalized grammar of Sanskrit at large. The Vedic texts
were maintained orally by Brahmins who used the more contemporary forms
of Sanskrit in their academic and ritual activity, and hence the existence of the
Vedic texts was fully circumscribed by the use of the contemporary forms of
Sanskrit. Secondly, the recitational segmentations and recombinations often
created sequences which were not strictly speaking Vedic, and these were more
directly subject to the rules of the contemporary usage of Sanskrit. This is the
case, for instance, when Śākalya adds the word iti after certain forms in the
Padapāṭha, or when the words are reversed in their order in the Jaṭāpāṭha, i.e.
a\+b\+b\+a\+a\+b. This phenomenon of active recitational switching between
Vedic grammar and the grammar of contemporary Sanskrit is discussed in my
paper “Grammars and Grammar-Switching in Vedic Recitational Variations,”
\(Deshpande, 1994\). Thus, one may not necessarily assume that there ever
existed grammatical texts, some precursors of our Prātiśākhyas, which were
strictly related to the facts of a particular Śākhā, and were not at all influenced
by or concerned with the general grammar of contemporary Sanskrit. 
6.4. The Perceived Role of General Grammar in Relation 
to Prātiśākhyas
6.4.1. Patañjali indeed asserts that the Padakāras should follow the
Grammarians, and the Grammarians should not follow the Padakāras \(न लक्षणेन
पदकारा अनुवर्त्त्याः, पदकारैर्नाम लक्षणमनुवर्त्त्यम्, MB, Kielhorn edn., Vol.II., p. 85\).

62 INTRODUCTION
The Prātiśākhya tradition as we know it does seem to accept a view that its
specifications are to be understood on the background of a general grammar of
Sanskrit. This is seen from the following discussions
6.4.2. Consider CA 1.1.3-4 \(एवमिहेति च विभाषाप्राप्तं सामान्ये\). The com-
mentary CAB on this rule says:
एवमिहेति च । अस्यां शाखायां तत्प्रातिज्ञं मन्यन्ते । ‘यरोऽनुनासिकेऽ-
नुनासिको वा’ \(पा.८.४.४५\) इति विभाषाप्राप्तं सामान्ये । किं सामान्यम् ।
व्याकरणम् । वक्ष्यति ‘उत्तमा उत्तमेषु’ \(च.आ. २.१.५\) इति ।
“\[On\] thus it is in this \[branch\]. In this branch, such is con-
sidered to be the \[specific, non-optional\] doctrine. In the
generic \[grammar of Sanskrit\], namely in P.8.4.45, \[the proce-
dure of changing a stop to its corresponding nasal, before a
nasal\] obtains optionally. What is the generic description? This
is the tradition of grammar. \[The CA\] will state \[its own
specific, i.e. non-optional, procedure\] in 2.1.5.”
This suggests the relation between a general grammar of Sanskrit and a
Prātiśākhya as that between a generic description of a language comprising all
its dialectal and temporal manifestations and a specific description of a specific
text. The general grammar of Sanskrit had to introduce a number of options,
due to its goal of describing the large variety of linguistic phenomena under its
coverage, cf. सर्ववेदपारिषदं हीदं शास्त्रं तत्र नैकः पन्थाः शक्य आस्थातुम्, MB on
P.2.1.58 and P.6.3.14, “Indeed this science \[of grammar\] is concerned with all
Vedic traditions \[taken together\], and hence it is not possible to choose a
unique \[= non-optional\] path \[of description, which would apply only to a
specific Vedic branch\].” On the other hand, the Prātiśākhya literature relates to
us the specific choices made by a specific textual tradition.
6.4.3. Uvaṭa, in his introductory commentary on the first Paṭala of the
R̥gveda-Prātiśākhya, discusses this relationship at length. He presents two
opposing views. Some claimed that the Prātiśākhyas are statements of ex-
ceptions to the rules of a general grammar of Sanskrit, while others claimed
them to be independent treatises. Finally, Uvaṭa says: अनयोः पक्षयोर्यतरः पक्षः
श्रेयांस्ततरो ग्रहीतव्यः, RPR, Vol.II., p. 23, “Of these two views, one may choose
the one which is deemed to be beneficial”. However, he has paid greater
attention to the first alternative, namely that the relationship of a Prātiśākhya to
a general grammar of Sanskrit is that of a specific description to a generic
description. He says \(RPR, Vol.II., pp. 21-23\):

“The purpose of \[this\] science \[of the Prātiśākhya\] is \[to clarify\]
that the rules which are generically expressed in the Śikṣās,
metrics \(chandas\) and grammars are \[effective\] in this branch in
a restricted manner. This verse elucidates the purpose of a
Prātiśākhya. The rules are stated generically in the Śikṣās and
other texts. For example, in the Śikṣā statement ‘r̥, ṭ-series, r
and ṣ should be cerebral,’ the sound r is generically said to be a
cerebral sound in all Vedic traditions. Thus, all the Śikṣās
generically prescribe the points of articulation, articulators,
phonation etc. for sounds with reference to all Vedic branches,
but they do not specifically say in which branch the sound r is
invariably cerebral, and where it is \[invariably\] alveolar.
Therefore, this \[science of the Prātiśākhya\] is undertaken to
settle such \[questions\]. Similarly, the grammar makes generic
statements, for example P.6.1.133. This \[Prātiśākhya\] is
undertaken to settle this question. The words \[listed in
P.6.1.133, i.e. tu, nu, gha etc.\] are consistently free from
lengthening in this entire textual tradition \[of the RV\]. Thus,
the rules which are generically stated by the Śikṣās, metrics, and
grammars, indifferently with respect to all Vedic branches, are
specifically settled by this \[Prātiśākhya\] with respect to this
particular Vedic branch. This is the purpose of this ancillary
tradition. The same purpose is expressed in the Prātiśākhya of
the Atharvaveda \[= CA\] in rules CA \(1.1.3-4\). Such is the

64 INTRODUCTION
significance of this rule: Whatever \[procedure\] obtains
optionally through generic descriptions is settled in a restrictive
way in this Vedic branch. This way the purpose of the
Prātiśākhya is explained.”
6.4.4. On VPR \(6.24: परोपापावप्रतिपर्यन्वप्यत्यध्याङ्प्रसन्निर्दुरुन्निविस्वभि\),
which provides a list of Upasargas, Uvaṭa’s commentary says:
एते विंशतिरुपसर्गाः प्रकृतिस्वरा भवन्ति ।... प्रकृतिस्वरस्तु व्याकरण-
पठितोऽत्र गृह्यते । तथा च तत् सूत्रम् - ‘निपाता आद्युदात्ताः,’ ‘उपसर्गा-
श्चाभिवर्जम्’ इति ।
“These twenty upasargas \[as listed in VPR 6.24\] retain their
natural accent. The natural accent as stated in the grammar is
taken for granted in this tradition. Thus, there are the \[follow-
ing\] grammatical rules: ‘The nipātas have their first syllable
high-pitched. So do the upasargas, except abhi.’” 
Anantabhaṭṭa’s commentary on the VPR also repeats the same Sūtras
of some Vyākaraṇa. These rules are not found in Pāṇini’s grammar, but are
found in the Phiṭsūtras \(80, 81\) ascribed to Śāntanava. In any case, the dis-
cussion assumes that the Prātiśākhyas take for granted the prescriptions of the
general grammar of Sanskrit.
6.4.5. The commentary Vaidikābharaṇa by Gopālayajvan on TPR
uses the word mūlaśāstra “original science” for Pāṇini’s rules \(cf., on TPR
5.14, 5.33, 7.16, 9.10, 10.9, 11.1, 13.4, 14.4\) and views the rules of the TPR
as statements of exceptions applicable exclusively to the text of the TS. The
TPR \(19.5: न पूर्वशास्त्रे न पूर्वशास्त्रे\) makes a reference to a pūrvaśāstra, a prior
grammatical system, and again Gopālayajvan says: अस्य शास्त्रस्य मूलभूतं व्याक-
रणं पूर्वशास्त्रमित्युच्यते, “The tradition of grammar which forms the basis of this
science \[of the Prātiśākhya\] is referred to as a prior \[= foundational\] science.”
6.4.6. The same term pūrvaśāstra is used in the CAB on CA \(4.4.27\)
and seems to have the same reference, namely Pāṇinian grammar.
The above evidence indicates that the Prātiśākhya tradition viewed itself
as a description of specific linguistic features found in specific texts, and for
more generic facts, it took for granted the prescriptions of the general grammar
of Sanskrit. For most of the commentatorial tradition, this general grammar of
Sanskrit was non other than that of Pāṇini.

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ  65
6.5. Which general grammar do the Prātiśākhyas and 
their commentators assume?
6.5.1. The commentators, as discussed earlier, seem to refer to
Pāṇini’s grammar while discussing the general grammar taken for granted by
the Prātiśākhyas. I would like to make some important historical distinctions in
using the term ‘grammar.’ We must make at least the following distinctions:
a\) general grammatical principles taken for granted by the Padakāras, 
but not spelled out clearly by them.
b\) general grammatical principles taken for granted by the authors of 
the Prātiśākhyas. 
c\) grammatical system as taken for granted by the commentators.
6.5.2. It is important to make a distinction between these various
notions of grammar, so that we may hope to have a clear understanding of the
changing historical situation. For example, the Padapāṭha provides us a seg-
mentation of the Saṃhitā as a fait accompli. In general, it provides a word-for-
word segmentation of the Saṃhitā-text. However, in many cases, it separates
the members of compounds, and the base from certain affixes. What we
possess is not a theory of segmentation, but the segmentation itself, or the lack
of it, and hence we can only indirectly infer the grammatical categories which
were used by the authors of the Padapāṭha, cf. V.N. Jha 1987. For instance,
we do not know in some cases whether the Padakāra viewed the segments
separated by an Avagraha as members of a compound, or as a base and an
affix. For instance, the rule CA \(4.1.49: कृत्वे समासो वा नानापददर्शनात्\) and the
commentary CAB on it raise such a question concerning the segment kr̥tvaḥ.
For Pāṇini, we know that the item kr̥tvasUC is indeed an affix, cf. P.5.4.17
\(संख्यायाः क्रियाभ्यावृत्तिगणने कृत्वसुच्\). On the other hand, the facts of the AV
Padapāṭha are such that kr̥tvas is sometimes separated by an Avagraha, and
sometimes it is not, e.g. aṣṭa-kr̥tvaḥ \(AV 11.2.9\) is separated by an Avagraha,
but daśakr̥tvaḥ \(AV 11.2.9\) and saptakr̥tvaḥ \(AV 12.2.29\) are not separated by
an Avagraha. The author of the CA says that where it is separated by an
Avagraha, it is a case of a Samāsa ‘compound.’ For Pāṇini, it is a case of
affixation. All we know about the Padapāṭha is that kr̥tvas is sometimes sepa-
rated by an Avagraha. We do not know whether the author of the Padapāṭha
treated this as a case of compounding or affixation, or whether these specific

66 INTRODUCTION
distinctions between compounding and affixation developed later on. Here, we
should note another interesting dimension of this problem. While it is clear that
by invoking the category of Samāsa, the author of the CA demonstrates his
familiarity with a grammatical system, that grammatical system is indeed not
that of Pāṇini. Consider for instance, CA 4.1.50 \(जातीयादिषु च\). Taken in the
context of the previous rule, i.e. CA 4.1.49 \(कृत्वे समासो वा ...\), this rule also
relates to the treatment of a segment as a member of a compound, and its
consequent segmentation by an Avagraha. There are two points to be taken
into account in this case. The expression jātīyādi refers to a Gaṇa or a listing.
However, there are no examples of jātīya attested in the AV. This means that
the CA is indeed bringing in a Gaṇa from some generalized grammar of
Sanskrit. However, while the CA, and probably the grammatical source from
which it takes this generalized Gaṇa, treat this as a case of compounding
\(samāsa\), Pāṇini \(5.3.69: प्रकारवचने जातीयर्\) clearly treats this as a case of
affixation. Thus, one can assert that the author of the CA is familiar with a
generalized grammar of Sanskrit, but that grammar need not be identical with
that of Pāṇini. 
6.6. Generalized description of Sanskrit as the occasional
target of the Prātiśākhyas
6.6.1. While the term ‘Prātiśākhya’ does indeed seem to imply that
ideally there should be a specific Prātiśākhya text for each distinct Śākhā, and
that the specific text should not aim at linguistic phenomena extending beyond
its chosen Vedic Śākhā, the authors of the Prātiśākhyas, for reasons not clearly
understood by us, often sojourn into such external territories. Gopālayajvan in
his commentary Vaidikābharaṇa on TPR \(11.9\) discusses this question:
स्वशाखायामलब्धावकाशो हि विधिः शाखान्तरविषयत्वकल्पनयोपपादयितव्यः \(Mysore
edn., p. 317\), “Indeed a rule, for which one does not find an example in one’s
own Vedic branch, should be explained as having examples in other Vedic
branches.” This issue comes up very often in interpreting the rules of the CA.
Consider the following instances:
1\) CA \(4.2.5-6: षट्पुरसोरुकारोऽन्त्यस्य दशदाशयोरादेश्च मूर्धन्यः\). CA \(4.2.5:
षोडशी सन्देहात्\) says that the word ṣoḍaśī is not split with an Avagraha in the
Padapāṭha, due to doubts regarding the exact boundaries of the member ele-
ments. In part, this statement is simply an observation that the word ṣoḍaśī is
not split with an Avagraha. On the other hand, the remainder of the statement,
i.e. sandehāt, is a criticism of the author of the Padapāṭha, who apparently
could not overcome this alleged sandeha. The rules CA \(4.2.5-6\) in fact

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 67
represent a clear effort on the part of the author of the CA to overcome this
element of sandeha, and in a way mark a grammatical advance over the
Padapāṭha. However, of what practical consequence are these rules? The new
derivation does not lead to a new segmentation with an Avagraha, but only to a
better understanding of the etymology of these words. Such an advance,
though indeed praiseworthy, is of little utility in either converting the Padapāṭha
into Saṃhitā, or in explaining why a certain segmentation is the way it is.
Strictly speaking, this is an advance in the territory of general grammar of
Sanskrit, which has its scope extending far beyond that of a Prātiśākhya.
2\) CA \(1.3.2: कृपे रेफस्य लकारः\). This rule, like Pāṇini’s rule P.8.2.18
\(कृपो रो लः\), derivationally links the forms of kl̥p/kalp with those of kr̥p. What
is the practical utility of such a rule for a Prātiśākhya? While it marks an
advance in the understanding of the derivation of the forms of kl̥p, the sound-
change taught by this rule remains unutilized in the crucial area of the
Pada<>Saṃhitā relationship. This change does not figure in the process of
samāpatti or restoration of the supposedly original sounds of an item in Pada
and Krama variation. The forms of kl̥p are not restored to kr̥p. Thus, this
remains an advance in the area of grammatical derivation, which is strictly
speaking outside the scope of a Prātiśākhya.
3\) CA \(1.3.25: शान्मान्दानाम्\). This rule teaches that the long ā of the
listed roots becomes nasalized before the affix -san. Out of these three roots,
only the forms of mān, e.g. mīmāṃsamānāḥ \(AV 9.1.3\) is attested in the ŚAV.
Why should this text concern itself with other roots? Should we assume with
Surya Kanta, that the forms of these other roots may have occurred in a sup-
posedly more genuine Śaunakīya recension? I, rather, tend to agree with
Whitney. He shows the similarity of this CA rule with P.3.1.6 \(मान्बधदान्शान्भ्यो
दीर्घश्चाभ्यासस्य\) and suggests that, in the present rule, the CA is simply carried
away by the urge to account for facts of the general grammar of Sanskrit.
6.7. Connection of the CA with the traditions of Sanskrit
Grammar.
6.7.1. The following examples show how intricately the CA is con-
nected with some traditions of Sanskrit grammar. Some of these features, but
not all, look like those of the Pāṇinian grammar, and it is possible that both the
texts are drawing upon certain common sources. The CA does not share
Pāṇini’s ultra-algebraic style, but it shares a number of common terms, and
other features. These are a few illustrations:

6.7.2. To show that the CA has similarities with the Pāṇinian gram-
mar, but is not exclusively identical to it, consider the following non-Pāṇinian
grammatical features:

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 69
1\) Lack of Pāṇini’s algebraic formulations: 
CA \(1.3.2: कृपे रेफस्य लकारः\) versus P.8.2.18 \(कृपो रो लः\)
CA \(1.3.12: ईकारोकारौ च सप्तम्यर्थे\) versus P.1.1.19 \(ईदूतौ च
सप्तम्यर्थे\)
CA \(1.4.1: वर्णादन्त्यात्पूर्व उपधा\) vs. P.1.1.65 \(अलोऽन्त्यात्पूर्व उपधा\)
2\) Non-Pāṇinian terminology:
CA \(1.2.15: परस्य स्वरस्य व्यञ्जनानि\). Contrast svara and
vyañjana with Pāṇini’s algebraic shortforms aC and
haL, respectively.
CA \(1.3.26: वस्वन्तस्य पञ्चपद्याम्\). Contrast pañcapadī with
Pāṇini’s sarvanāmasthāna as defined by P.1.1.43 \(सुड-
नपुंसकस्य\).
CA \(2.1.2: पदान्तानामनुत्तमानां तृतीया घोषवत्स्वरेषु\). Contrast tr̥tīya
and ghoṣavat with Pāṇini’s algebraic shortforms jaŚ and
jhaŚ in P.8.4.53 \(झलां जश् झशि\).
CA \(2.4.7: नामिकरेफात् प्रत्ययसकारस्य\). Contrast nāmi-ka-rephāt
with Pāṇini’s iṆ-koḥ in P.8.3.57 \(इण्कोः\).
CA \(3.2.26: भूतकरणस्य च\). Contrast bhūtakaraṇasya with āṭaḥ
in P.6.1.90 \(आटश्च\).
3\) Non-Pāṇinian procedures: \(For details, see Notes on the respective 
CA rules\)
CA \(2.1.3: पदान्ते चाघोषाः\) vs. P.8.4.56 \(वावसाने\).
CA \(2.1.31: मकारस्य स्पर्शे परसस्थानः\) vs.
P.8.4.58 \(अनुस्वारस्य ययि परसवर्णः\).
CA \(3.4.25-26: व्यवाये शसलैः, चटतवर्गैश्च\) vs.
P.8.4.2 \(अट्कुप्वाङ्नुम्व्यवायेऽपि\).
The conclusion based on the above evidence is that the CA was familiar
with grammatical traditions which were in part like Pāṇini’s grammar, but in
part different from it. It does not look like a text which is a direct reworking of
Pāṇini’s grammar.

70 INTRODUCTION
6.8. The early tradition reflected in the metrical authority
quoted in the CAB.
6.8.1. The CAB looks like a fairly old commentary, perhaps as old as
the KV. The commentary occasionally quotes statements which look like
Vārttikas of some sort, and these mark an advance of the tradition, beyond the
stage set by the CA itself. The commentary also quotes profusely from a met-
rical authority, some verses of which are identical with those of the Varṇa-
paṭala, a Pariśiṣṭa of the Atharvaveda. However, this commentary quotes a
large number of verses which are not attested in the currently available text of
the Varṇapaṭala. It is likely that the Varṇapaṭala is itself a short selection from
a larger older authority. This older authority is probably older than the text of
the Māṇḍūkīśikṣā. This Śikṣā was not known to the CAB. Whether the
metrical authority quoted to elucidate the contents of the CA is older than the
CA itself is a difficult question. CA \(1.2.10: पूर्वरूपस्य मात्रार्धं समानकरणं परम्\) is
identical with the first two quarters of a verse quoted in the CAB on this rule:
पूर्वरूपस्य मात्रार्धं समानकरणं परम् ।
प्रत्ययेन भवेत् कार्यमेतत् संयुक्तमिष्यते ॥
There is indeed a possibility that the metrical authority is older than the
text of the CA, though one cannot be completely certain in this matter. In any
case, the metrical authority is older than the CAB.
6.8.2. The metrical authority exhibits greater familiarity with the
Pāṇinian tradition, as compared to the rules of the Caturādhyāyikā. This can be
seen from the following instances:
a\)Metrical Authority: एदैतोः, on CA \(1.1.19\). Here, in the
expressions eT and aiT, the marker T is clearly identical with
the marker T defined in P.1.1.70 \(तपरस्तत्कालस्य\).
b\)Metrical Authority: समानास्यप्रयत्ना ये ते सवर्णा इति स्मृताः, on CA
\(1.1.27\). This is the only known early authority which coin-
cides with P.1.1.9 \(तुल्यास्यप्रयत्नं सवर्णम्\) in its use of the term
āsyaprayatna. The CA does not use this term. 
c\)Metrical Authority: टाशब्दः, on CA \(4.1.33\) to refer to the
instrumental singular affix. Pāṇini \(4.1.2: स्वौजसमौट्छस्टा...\) also

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 71
uses the expression ṭā for the same affix. The metrical authority
seems to take this term for granted.
d\)Metrical Authority: अङ्गस्य, on CA \(4.1.38\). The CA does not
use the term aṅga, but P.1.3.13 \(यस्मात् प्रत्ययविधिस्तदादि प्रत्ययेऽ-
ङ्गम्\) defines this term. The metrical authority seems to take this
term for granted.
e\)Metrical Authority: कृत्, on CA \(4.1.48-49\). The term kr̥t is not
used by the CA. Pāṇini defines it as P.3.1.93 \(कृदतिङ्\). The
metrical authority seems to take this term for granted.
f\)Metrical Authority: मतुप् and मयट्, on CA \(4.1.49\). CA \(4.2.1:
न तकारसकाराभ्यां मत्वर्थे\) knows the first affix as matu, and CA
\(4.1.46: मयेऽसकारात्\) knows the second affix as maya. Pāṇini
refers to these affixes as matuP \(P.5.2.94: तदस्यास्त्यस्मिन्निति
मतुप्\) and mayaṬ \(P.5.4.21: तत्प्रकृतवचने मयट्\).
g\)Metrical Authority: किकिनौ, on CA \(4.1.57\). These two affixes
are taught by Pāṇini \(3.2.171: आदृगमहनजनः किकिनौ लिट् च\).
h\)Metrical Authority: बहुलं छन्दसि, on CA \(4.1.57\). This is a ref-
erence to a rule in Pāṇini, which occurs a number of times in his
grammar, e.g. P.3.2.88.
i\)Metrical Authority:अभ्यासस्य च दीर्घत्वं दीर्घोऽकितेति दृश्यते । ...
यद्यभ्यासस्य दीर्घत्वं तुजादीनां च यङ्लुकोः । सवर्णे च परोक्षायां ..., on
CA \(4.3.12\). Compare: P.7.4.83 \(दीर्घोऽकितः\), P.6.1.7 \(तुजादीनां
दीर्घोऽभ्यासस्य\), and P.6.4.78 \(अभ्यासस्यासवर्णे\). 
This evidence amply demonstrates that the versified authority quoted by
the CAB was fully familiar with Pāṇini’s grammar, and that it quotes it
profusely. At the same time, one must make it clear that it is almost totally free
from the impact of the Pāṇinīyaśikṣā and the phonetic doctrines of the later
Pāṇinian tradition. It is in many ways closer to the tradition represented in the
RPR. 
6.8.3. To illustrate its relatively more archaic phonetic doctrines, I
shall draw attention to the following details. Unlike the metrical Pāṇinīyaśikṣā
\(verse 18: एऐ तु कण्ठतालव्यावोऔ कण्ठोष्ठजौ स्मृतौ\), this cited metrical authority

72 INTRODUCTION
regards only ai and au as having an initial kaṇṭhya element \(कण्ठ्यः ...
ऐदौतोराद्ययोर्मात्रयोः स्मृतः, on CA 1.1.19\), while the sounds e and o are consid-
ered to be tālavya and oṣṭhya, respectively \(cf. ताल्वेयशचवर्गाणामिवर्णस्य च, on CA
1.1.21; उपध्मानीय ओकारो ... तथा \(ओष्ठ्याः\) मताः, on CA 1.1.25\). It holds the
sounds r̥, l̥, ka-varga, and the jihvāmūlīya to be jihvāmūlīya sounds \(cf.
जिह्वामूलमृवर्णस्य कवर्गस्य च भाष्यते । यश्चैव जिह्वामूलीय ऌवर्णश्चेति च स्मृतः, on CA
1.1.20\). The only retroflex sounds are ṣ and the ṭavarga \(cf. मूर्धा स्थानं षकारस्य
टवर्गस्य तथा मतम्, on CA 1.1.22\). The sound r is treated as a dantamūlīya,
though the metrical authority is aware of other views on its alternative classi-
fications \(cf. रेफस्य दन्तमूलानि ... अपर आह ... हनुमूले तु रेफस्य दन्तमूलेषु वा पुनः ।
प्रत्यग्वा दन्तमूलेभ्यो मूर्धन्य इति चापरे, on CA 1.1.28\). Thus, on the whole, this
ancient metrical authority holds fairly archaic phonetic classifications, while
exhibiting a wide ranging awareness of Pāṇinian terminology.
6.9. The tradition as reflected in the CAB
6.9.1. The CAB exhibits greater familiarity with the Pāṇinian rules.
It quotes some of them directly. Also, while quoting the ancient metrical
authority discussed above, it offers phonetic classifications which are more in
line with the later Pāṇinian system as represented by the metrical Pāṇinīyaśikṣā.

Most of the examples, not attested in the AV, are found in the
KV on P.8.3.7 \(नश्छव्यप्रशान्\). It is absolutely unconscionable
that the commentary does not offer a single example from the
text of the Atharvan to illustrate this phenomenon, which is by
no means rare in the Atharvan text. By citing the examples
which he does, the commentator shows how deeply influenced
he is by the of Pāṇinian tradition.

The KV on P.6.1.101 \(अकः सवर्णे दीर्घः\) cites the examples
daṇḍāgram, dadhīndraḥ, madhūdake, and hotr̥̄śyaḥ. The
Osmania edition of the KV notes a manuscript variant
madhūṣṭram for madhūdake. This variant is probably a cor-
ruption of madhūṣṇam. 
6.9.4.Influence of the Late Pāṇinian Phonetic 
Classifications:
a\) The CAB includes e, ai, o, and au, among the kaṇṭhya sounds,
implying that the initial elements of all the four are kaṇṭhya sounds \(cf. CAB
on CA 1.1.19\). This notion is more in line with the metrical Pāṇinīyaśikṣā
\(verse 1: एऐ तु कण्ठतालव्यावोऔ कण्ठोष्ठजौ स्मृतौ\), and it directly contradicts the
doctrines of the cited metrical authority \(कण्ठ्यः ... ऐदौतोराद्ययोर्मात्रयोः स्मृतः, on
CA 1.1.19, ताल्वेयशचवर्गाणामिवर्णस्य च, on CA 1.1.21; उपध्मानीय ओकारो ... तथा
ओष्ठ्याः मताः, on CA 1.1.25\).

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 75
b\) On CA 1.1.22, it includes r among the mūrdhanya sounds, again
contradicting both the cited metrical authority, as well as the direct prescription
of the CA 1.1.28 \(रेफस्य दन्तमूलानि\). This notion is closer to the metrical
Pāṇinīyaśikṣā \(verse 17: स्युर्मूर्धन्या ऋटुरषाः\). The CAB \(on CA 1.1.28\) says that
the ‘roots of teeth’ \(dantamūlāni\) are the karaṇa ‘articulator’ for r. This is
believed not to contradict the claim that r is a mūrdhanya sound. However, it
makes little sense to say that the ‘cerebrum, top of the oral cavity’ is the point
of articulation for r, and that the ‘roots of teeth’ are the articulator for it.
c\) While the cited metrical authority \(in CAB on CA 1.1.25\) considers
v to be an oṣṭhya sound, the CAB \(on CA 1.1.25\) takes it out of the list of
oṣṭhya sounds, possibly implying that v is a dantyoṣṭhya ‘labio-dental’ sound.
This is again closer to the doctrines of the metrical Pāṇinīyaśikṣā \(verse 18:
दन्त्योष्ठ्यो वः स्मृतो बुधैः\).
6.10.The Pāṇinian Drift seen in Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s 
Vr̥tti
6.10.1. While the CAB is probably closer in date to the KV, the
commentary of Bhārgava-Bhāskara and the Pañcasandhi by Kr̥ṣṇadāsa
represent the very late phase of this tradition. These late works indicate that the
tradition of the CA has now come under the full Pāṇinian influence as typified
by works like Bhaṭṭojī Dīkṣita’s SK. This late tradition does not show any
awareness of the existence of the older commentary CAB, or of the metrical
authority quoted by the CAB. Bhārgava-Bhāskara cites not only Pāṇini’s
rules, but also the versified Pāṇinīyaśikṣā, and he twists the meaning of the CA
rules to fit the interpretations of Pāṇini’s rules found in the late texts like the
SK. Below we shall briefly review the evidence from Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s
commentary:

Contrast the two commentaries. Bhārgava-Bhāskara seems to
have confused the notion of prayatna as it appears in the
Pāṇinian school with that of karaṇa in this text. The first term
refers to the manner in which the articulator \(karaṇa\) relates to
the point of articulation \(sthāna\). On the other hand, the second

It is clearly seen from the above evidence that Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s
commentary has offered a fully late-Pāṇinian interpretation of the CA rules.
He has no knowledge of the older commentary CAB or of the metrical
authority quoted by the CAB. His authorities include the late Māṇḍūkīśikṣā,
but more importantly, the versified Pāṇinīyaśikṣā. Thus the independence of
the CA tradition is lost in this process. Since Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commen-
tary is available to us only in an incomplete form, it is difficult to assess what
he did with the rest of the CA rules.
6.11.Full Pāṇinianization of the CA rules in Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s
Kautsavyākaraṇe Pañcasandhiḥ
6.11.1. Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s Kautsavyākaraṇe Pañcasandhiḥ represents the
latest and the most severe case of Pāṇinianization of a Prātiśākhya tradition.
The text probably belongs to the period after the SK of Bhaṭṭojī Dīkṣita became
popular. It reorganizes the rules of the CA using the model of the SK,4 and
seems to add a whole host of new Sūtras, not found in the CA. Almost at
every step, Kr̥ṣṇadāsa compares the CA formulations with those of Pāṇini, and
effectively provides a fully Pāṇinian interpretation of the CA rules. In contrast
with the CAB as well as Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary, Kr̥ṣṇadāsa hardly
quotes Atharvan examples. Most of his examples are identical with those
found in texts like the SK, and in effect he is trying to build a grammar of the
classical language using the rules of the CA, and in this process he stretches
the CA rules maximally in the direction of the late Pāṇinian tradition. The
following examples are offered to illustrate this phenomenon of maximal
Pāṇinianization in Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s work. In my notes on Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s work, I
have discussed the parallelisms with the late Pāṇinian works such as the SK
more fully. Here, a few instances are noted:

4 In this respect, Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s work resembles the commentary Prātiśākhyajyotsnā on the VPR.
For details on this work and its reorganization of the VPR rules along the lines of Bhaṭṭojī
Dīkṣita’s SK, see: Sunanda R. Abhyankar \(1984\).

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 79
6.12. The changing nature of the CA tradition
On the basis of the above evidence tracing the historical changes which
occurred in the CA tradition, we can draw the following conclusions.
The CA itself was perhaps familiar with Pāṇinian, or perhaps Pāṇini-
like, terminology, and occasionally it does venture into explanations of
formations which do not occur in the AV, but on the whole it is an authentic
description of a particular phase of the Śaunakīya AV. Generally, the text is
concerned with the AV, and represents a distinct tradition.
The Metrical Authority, an ancient Śikṣā relating to the AV tradition,
predates the later Māṇḍūkīśikṣā. It shows substantial familiarity with Pāṇini’s
system, and yet it shows a true independent view of Sanskrit phonetics, not
colored by what one finds in the versified Pāṇinīyaśikṣā. We can safely
assume that this ancient Śikṣā predates the versified Pāṇinīyaśikṣā.
The CAB shows even greater familiarity with the Pāṇinian tradition,
perhaps with the KV. Its phonetic description is beginning to show signs of
the influence of the late Pāṇinian tradition, though it does not directly quote the
versified Pāṇinīyaśikṣā. However, it is clear that its deviations from the quoted
Metrical Authority are in the direction of the versified Pāṇinīyaśikṣā. At the
same time, it is genuinely related to the Atharvavedic tradition, and it has a very
close connection with the APR edited by Surya Kanta.
The commentary of Bhārgava-Bhāskara shows a deep influence of the
Pāṇinian tradition. It looks like it has no knowledge of either the CAB or the
Metrical Authority quoted by it. On the other hand, it quotes Pāṇini, the
Māṇḍūkīśikṣā, and the versified Pāṇinīyaśikṣā. Its interpretations are colored
by this late phase of the Pāṇinian tradition. However, at the same time it must
be admitted that it is closely linked with the Atharvavedic tradition, and it cites
a large number of examples from the text of the Atharvaveda.
The last text, i.e. Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s Kautsavyākaraṇe Pañcasandhiḥ, is a truly
different text. It is an SK-style reorganization of the CA rules, clearly
dominated by the SK. It is only peripherally part of the Atharvavedic tradition.
The examples cited by this commentary are hardly different from those of the
SK, and rarely does it cite anything from the AV. It is an effort to write a
grammar of the classical language using the rules of the CA, supplemented by
a set of new rules based on the Pāṇinian system. Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s work is also
largely influenced by Anubhūtisvarūpācārya’s Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa.
The above survey indicates how the tradition of the CA gradually lost its
individuality and came under the direct influence of the dominant grammatical
paradigm, i.e. the Pāṇinian tradition. This influence perhaps kept the tradition

80 INTRODUCTION
of the CA alive, but in the process of keeping it alive, the CA tradition was
gradually drained of its grammatical and phonetic distinctiveness, and, in this
sense, the Pāṇinian influence must be viewed as a negative force, and not a
positive help in the interpretation of the Prātiśākhya tradition. 
7. The AV Prātiśākhyas and the ŚAV Text-
Transmission
7.1.General Issues of Saṃhitā Formation and 
Transmission
7.1.1. In his MB, Patañjali says that the Atharvaveda has nine differ-
ent recensions \(cf. नवधाथर्वणो वेदः, MB, Vol.I, p. 9\). However, the Saṃhitā of
the Atharvaveda is available to us at present only in two major recensions, i.e.
the Śaunakīya and the Paippalāda. The two recensions differ in their overall
organization of the material, and the readings for individual verses differ in
hundreds of places. The readings found in any one recension are authentic
only in so far as they represent that particular recension of the Atharvaveda,
and there is no intrinsic claim for any reading to represent the Ur-Atharvaveda,
if indeed there was such a thing. With the Vedic Saṃhitās, scholars have
proposed two distinct phases of oral transmission. Oldenberg \(1890, 1962:
28\), referring to the Saṃhitā of the RV, says: “The study of Śaunaka’s work
\[= RPR\] affords us the proof that from that time on the Vedic hymns, protected
by the united care of grammatical and religious respect for letters, have suffered
no further appreciable corruptions.” However, worth noting are his comments
on the pre-redaction textual transmission: “In some cases, isolated details of the
additions of prior epochs were caught and clung to with felicitous acumen; in
others, no hesitation was had in wiping out of existence entire domains of old
and genuine phenomena to suit half-correct theories, so that the most patient
ingenuity of modern science will only be able to restore in part what has been
lost” \(1890, 1962: 27\). He further reminds us that “the collection was re-
corrected on repeated occasions. It is conceivable enough that thus the original
structure, yes, even the existence itself of special hymns was often injured,
effaced, or destroyed” \(1890, 1962: 26\). The first phase represented the pre-
redaction period of the oral transmission, uncontrolled and unguided by any
systematic efforts at standardization, while the post-redaction phase was
characterized by a great deal of systematic standardization of the text in its
organization as well as its pronunciation. This second phase began with the
work of scholars like Śākalya for the RV, and Śaunaka for the Śaunakīya AV.

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 81
Patañjali refers to Śākalya’s well-prepared Saṃhitā \(cf. शाकल्येन सुकृतां
संहितामनुनिशम्य देवः प्रावर्षत्, MB on P.1.4.84, Vol.I, p. 347\) of the RV.
Śaunaka probably did the same thing for the AV Saṃhitā and prepared its
Padapāṭha. As it has been documented more fully for Śākalya, the Padapāṭha
reflects his understanding of the words of the Saṃhitā. It also reflects certain
features of his own dialect of Sanskrit \(Cardona 1991\). Finally, the Saṃhitā
was to be rebuilt by changing the Padapāṭha by applying the rules of Sandhi,
and hence in certain respects, the Saṃhitā, thus arrived at, reflected more
modern features, as compared to the original compositions of the Vedic seers
which are now lost to us. Thus, a given Saṃhitā represents not precisely the
original compositions of the Vedic seers, but compositions as they were
received, understood, interpreted, and organized by a particular Saṃhitākāra.
As this is true of Śākalya’s recension of the RV, so it must be true of
Śaunaka’s recension of the AV.
7.1.2.With all this, one may develop an impression that such recen-
sions or Saṃhitās, once they were so well put together by the respective
Saṃhitākāras, must have been essentially immutable, not susceptible to any
further change. As we shall see, such an expectation is wide-spread, but in fact
unfounded. For instance, we know that Pāṇini knew Śākalya’s RV Saṃhitā,
as he directly quotes Śākalya’s opinions in several places \(cf. लोपः शाकल्यस्य,
P. 8.3.19; सम्बुद्धौ शाकल्यस्येतावनार्षे, P.1.1.16\). However, can we be certain that
he knew Śākalya’s recension exactly as we know it today? Did he know the
RV with ḷ for intervocalic ḍ, or did his version not have this feature? In my
opinion, the latter alternative is more likely. If the RV recension of Śākalya
which has come down to us shows somewhat different features than what
were known to Pāṇini, is it possible for us to say that only one of these
versions is a true Śākalya recension, and that what survives is not a Śākalya
recension in a real sense? Or should we rather abandon the view of the
supposed immutability of these recensions, and accept a view that the
recensions once formulated by scholars like Śākalya and Śaunaka did undergo
a slow process of marginal change. Some of this change was imperceptible
phonetic change for a long time, but eventually such changes accumulated over
a period of time. In spite of such changes, it was still possible for the
successive generations of redactors to believe that they were still maintaining
the ancient recension formulated by Śākalya or Śaunaka. If we accept such a
view of the transmission of Vedic Saṃhitās, we may have a different
understanding of how these Saṃhitās were transmitted. Here we shall
investigate some of these questions in relation to the text-transmission of the

Prātiśākhyas.

Saṃhitā of the AV came out before Whitney’s 1862 edition of the
Caturādhyāyikā, Roth and Whitney were already in possession of the then
known single Berlin manuscript of the Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā with the
commentary CAB. Although this lone manuscript was terribly corrupt, Whit-
ney was able to extract a working text of the CA before he and Roth finalized
the text of their edition of the AV. Since they were editing the Śaunakīya AV,
they could see the value of the rules of the CA in the process of establishing
the text of the Saṃhitā. However, their AV manuscripts did not always agree
with the prescriptions of the CA. Whitney dutifully notes this divergence in
his notes on the CA. In such cases, Roth and Whitney were faced with the
question of whether to follow the authority of the manuscripts, or to abandon
the manuscripts and follow the rules of the Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā in set-
tling the reading to be selected. There were several assumptions to be made in
deciding this question. The text to be finally printed as that of the Śaunakīya
AV must ideally represent the text as settled by Śaunaka. Secondly, the text
which called itself Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā must also be assumed to reflect
the opinions of Śaunaka as regards the Saṃhitā and the Padapāṭha of this
school. Therefore, on the face of it, it seemed that one could follow the CA in
settling the text of the Śaunakīya Saṃhitā. In practice, the Roth-Whitney
edition of the ŚAV Saṃhitā follows the CA and rejects the manuscripts in
some places, and follows the manuscripts and rejects the CA in other places,
and Surya Kanta has rightly criticized Whitney and Roth for this haphazard
behavior: “What RW \(= Roth-Whitney\) have done in such cases is this, that,
either they have ignored the CA authority, adopting the unanimous reading of
the Vulgate mss., or they have flouted the Vulgate mss., and followed the
former” \(APR, Intro., p. 32\).
7.3. Surya Kanta’s assumption of the ‘lost original 
Śaunakīya AV’
7.3.1. In 1923, Vishva Bandhu \(= Vidyārthī\) published a text by the
title the Atharvaprātiśākhya, and in 1939, Surya Kanta published his magnifi-
cent expanded and annotated edition of the same Atharvaprātiśākhya. All the

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 83
manuscripts used for this text directly called it Atharvaprātiśākhya. Until then,
the title Atharvaprātiśākhya was used with reference to the Śaunakīyā
Caturādhyāyikā edited by Whitney. Whitney himself knew that the CA did not
call itself a Prātiśākhya, and yet he argued \(1862: iii\): “The treatise was first
brought to light, and its character deter-mined, by Roth. It was recognized by
him as being what is indicated by our title, a Prātiśākhya to a text of the
Atharvaveda. That it has any inherent right to be called the Prātiśākhya to the
Atharvaveda is not, of course, claimed for it; but, considering the extreme
improbability that any other like phonetic treatise, belonging to any other
schools of that Veda, will ever be brought to light, the title of Atharvaveda
Prātiśākhya finds a sufficient justification in its convenience, and in its analogy
with the names given to the other kindred treatises by their respective editors.”
The above paragraph from Whitney needs to be read carefully, and one
should note that he nowhere asserted that the CA is the Prātiśākhya of the
Atharva-Veda, an accusation hurled at him unjustly by Surya Kanta \(Atharva-
Prātiśākhya, Introduction, p. 31\): “Whitney turns an APr into the APr.”
Whitney never made such a claim. Whitney’s modest claim that the CA was ‘a
Prātiśākhya’ of the AV was clearly not out of line, and now stands supported
by a reference in Uvaṭa’s commentary on the first Paṭala of the R̥gveda-
Prātiśākhya: \(M.D. Shastri’s edition, Vol. II, p. 23\): तथा चाथर्वणप्रातिशाख्ये इदमेव
प्रयोजनमुक्तम् - ‘एवमिहेति च विभाषाप्राप्तं सामान्येन’ - अस्य सूत्रस्यायमर्थः - सामान्येन
लक्षणेन यद् विकल्पप्राप्तं तदेवमस्यां शाखायां व्यवस्थितं भवतीति प्रातिशाख्यप्रयोजनमुक्तम् ।,
“Thus, the same purpose is mentioned in the Ātharvaṇa-Prātiśākhya rule evam
iheti ca vibhāṣāprāptaṃ sāmānyena \(= CA 1.1.3-4, Whitney 1.2\). The meaning
of this rule is as follows: Whatever obtains optionally in a generic grammar of
Sanskrit is settled in a particular way in this branch. Thus, the purpose of the
Prātiśākhya is explained.”  Clearly, Uvaṭa refers to CA as an Ātharvaṇa-
Prātiśākhya.
7.3.2. Anyway, now we are fortunately in possession of two texts
which belong to the category of Prātiśākhyas for the Śaunakīya Atharvaveda,
or are we mistaken? If we are to believe Surya Kanta, we are indeed mistaken.
To put his claim in his own words: “The Atharva-Prātiśākhya belongs to the
AV., and the CA belongs to the Śaunakīya School of this Saṃhitā, and not to
the AV. in general” \(APR, Intro., p. 32\). He argues that the APR clearly does
not belong to the Paippalāda tradition, nor does it call itself Śaunakīya at any
place, and therefore it belongs to a non-Paippalāda and a non-Śaunakīya
recension of the AV. This, he calls, ‘the AV,’ in contrast with the Śaunakīya
recension, which he assumes must be the subject of the Śaunakīyā
Caturādhyāyikā. He offers the following arguments to support his case. For

84 INTRODUCTION
each argument, I have provided only a few sample examples, though Surya
Kanta has offered a large number of such examples.
7.3.3.Argument a:
7.3.3.1. In a number of places, the Vulgate of the AV, the text repre-
sented by the manuscripts, agrees more closely with the description in the
APR, than with the description in the CA: “The APR cites 3,236 AV.
passages, and the number of citations is probably larger than that contained in
any other Prātiśākhya. Out of this large number, there are hardly ten passages,
where the Vulgate mss. do not follow the sanction, explicit or implicit, of the
APR, while there occur hundreds of passages in the CA., where not a single
Vulgate ms. follows the sanction of this treatise, besides those typical cases,
where CA specifically prescribes a certain saṃdhi for a chosen passage, but
that saṃdhi is not carried out in that passage even by a single Vulgate ms.; and
this is significant” \(APR, Intro., p. 32\). 
7.3.3.2. For example, consider CA \(1.4.3, Whitney 1.94: सोष्मणि
पूर्वस्यानूष्मा\) and its examples. This rule says that if we have a sequence such as
nicakh-kh-nuḥ, the first kh changes to k, and we get the form nicak-kh-nuḥ.
Thus, we should get id-dh-ma, and not idh-dh-ma; rurud-dh-re, and not ru-
rudh-dh-re. In practice, the manuscripts of the Vulgate do not show forms like
nicak-kh-nuḥ. We only get nicakh-nuḥ. Thus, the CA rule is not obeyed by
the manuscripts of the Vulgate. Therefore, the Vulgate is not truly Śaunakīya.
7.3.3.3. Another such example is CA \(2.1.6, Whitney 2.6: द्वितीयाः
शषसेषु\). This rule requires that in a combination like godhuk-śete, the final k of
the first word be replaced by kh. This doctrine is explicitly ascribed to
Śaunaka by VPR \(4.119: असस्थाने मुदि द्वितीयं शौनकस्य\). However, the manu-
scripts of the Vulgate of the AV do not follow this rule, and hence, according
to Surya Kanta, the Vulgate is not Śaunakīya.
7.3.3.4. Referring to CA \(2.1.9, Whitney 2.9: ङणनेभ्यः कटतैः शषसेषु\),
Surya Kanta again points out that the Vulgate manuscripts do not show forms
like pratyaṅ-k-śete, and concludes: “\(1\) that CA records sandhis for the
Śaunaka AV; \(2\) that these are not observed by the Vulgate mss.; \(3\) that the
Vulgate does not represent the Śaunaka śākhā, but some other” \(APR, Intro.,
p. 40\).

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 85
7.3.4.Argument b:
7.3.4.1. In a number of places, the CA seems to be explaining
usages which are not found in the Vulgate text of the AV, and Surya Kanta
proposes that such usages must have existed in a genuinely Śaunakīya
recension.
7.3.4.2. For example, consider CA rules \(1.3.24, Whitney 1.86:
हनिगम्योः सनि\) and \(1.3.25, Whitney 1.87: शान्मान्दानाम्\). The first rule refers to
desiderative forms of the roots han and gam. While the desiderative of han is
attested in the AV, the desiderative of gam is not. Similarly, of the three roots
cited in CA \(1.1.26, Whitney 1.26\), only the desiderative forms for mān are
attested in the Vulgate of the AV, but the desideratives of śān and dān are not
so attested. Surya Kanta argues that the desiderative forms of gam, śān and
dān must have occurred in the original Śaunakīya recension, and their absence
in the Vulgate of the AV proves that the Vulgate is not Śaunakīya.
7.3.5. Argument c:
7.3.5.1.  The commentary CAB often quotes instances to illustrate
the CA rules which are not found in the Vulgate text of the AV. Surya Kanta
proposes that such instances must have existed in the genuinely Śaunakīya
recension.
7.3.5.2. For example, the CAB on CA \(1.1.16, Whitney 1.14-16\)
quotes an instance which appears in the manuscripts as prāmū ca roha. This is
not found in the Vulgate of the AV. Surya Kanta cites this as an example
which occurred in the so-called genuine Śaunakīya AV, which is now lost.
Whitney, I believe correctly, amends the manuscript reading to prajāṃ ca roha,
AV \(13.1.34\).
7.3.5.2. To cite another example, the CAB on CA \(1.1.28, Whitney
1.28\) cites an instance punā raktaṃ vāsaḥ, which not attested in the Vulgate
of the AV. Surya Kanta asserts that this example comes from the now lost
genuine Śaunakīya recension of the AV.
7.3.6. Argument d:
7.3.6.1. In some places, the APR explicitly goes against the rules of
the CA, and in such cases, the manuscripts of the AV generally seem to be
closer to the APR, than the CA. Therefore, the AV as found in the currently
available manuscripts does not represent the genuine Śaunakīya recension.

86 INTRODUCTION
7.3.6.2. For example, on CA \(2.3.6, Whitney 2.65: कुरुकरंकरत्कृणोतु-
कृतिकृधिष्वकर्णयोः\), the CAB says: कृणोतु इत्यत्र त्रिधात्विति वक्तव्यम् । ‘दीर्घमायु-
ष्कृणोतु’ \(अ.वे. ६.७८.३\)। ‘अग्निष्कृणोतु भेषजम्’ \(अ.वे. ६.१०६.३\) । ‘मणिष्कृणोतु
देवजाः’ \(अ.वे. १०.६.३१\). Thus, the CAB says that the change of a visarga to ṣ
before kr̥ṇotu occurs \[only\] in the three listed examples. Referring to the same
three instances, the APR \(148\) says: कृणोत्वित्यत्र त्रिधातु सत्वं न, “There is no
change of visarga to s \(and then to ṣ\) in these three examples.” This would
suggest that in the view of the APR, one was expected to maintain a visarga in
these cases. Surya Kanta points out that the Vulgate manuscripts follow the
APR, and not the CA. Then he concludes that the Vulgate is not a Śaunakīya
text.
7.3.6.3. Based upon an extensive examination of the CA, CAB, and
the APR, in relation to the existing manuscripts of the AV, Surya Kanta arrives
at the following conclusions:
1\)The APR belongs to the Vulgate.
2\)CA goes with the Śaunaka School
3\)the two are not one.
Besides these conclusions, Surya Kanta has given a detailed compari-
son of the readings for the AV as known to the APR and the readings as
known to Sāyaṇa. Sāyaṇa shows hundreds of different readings, “more than
300 readings in the first four Kāṇḍas alone” \(APR, Intro., p. 56\). Sāyaṇa
claims to represent the Śaunakīya version of the AV, and yet these different
readings exist in the text known to him. Surya Kanta suggests that one should
check the mss. of Sāyaṇa’s commentary to see if they conform to the sanctions
of the CA, and then decide whether he really commented on the Śaunakīya
recension. In any case, he would like to assert that whatever Śākhā is
represented by Sāyaṇa is not the same as the one represented by the APR. 
7.4. Surya Kanta’s Conclusions:
7.4.1. Based on the above discussion, we can list below the conclu-
sions drawn by Surya Kanta as I understand them.
Conclusion 1: The recensions or Saṃhitās, once they were
prepared by scholars like Śaunaka, were for all practical pur-
poses immutable. 

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 87
Conclusion 2: The Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā totally reflects
the opinions of Śaunaka, and hence the picture of the Saṃhitā
gathered from the CA must be viewed as a faithful representa-
tion of the original Saṃhitā prepared by Śaunaka.
Conclusion 3: The CA was designed to deal exclusively
with the linguistic facts of the original Śaunakīya Saṃhitā, and
nothing more. Therefore, all usages targeted by the rules of the
CA must have existed in the original Śaunaka AV, which is not
found in the Vulgate mss.
Conclusion 4:  The CA and the APR represented different
Śākhās of the AV, and are unrelated to each other. 
Conclusion 5:  The CAB is a completely faithful explanation
of the CA rules, and does not represent any change. The CAB,
like the CA, is a true Śaunakīya text, and that all the examples
cited by the CAB must have occurred in the genuine Śaunakīya
AV.
Conclusion 6:  Even though Sāyaṇa claims to be
commenting on the Śaunakīya AV, his text actually represents a
non-Śaunakīya recension.
Some of these conclusions have been explicitly articulated by Surya
Kanta, while others can be inferred from his arguments. 
7.5. Critique of Surya Kanta’s claims and assumptions.5
7.5.1.Critique of Surya Kanta’s Conclusion 1: 
7.5.1.1. In my opinion, this conclusion is unacceptable. It can be
demonstrated that while Pāṇini knew the RV Saṃhitā of Śākalya, the form in
which he knew it was not totally identical with the form of the RV Saṃhitā as
we know it. The Paippalāda as found in Kashmir and in Orissa shows in-

5In my annotations on the rules of the CA in this critical edition, I have discussed these issues
at a number of places. See Notes on the following CA rules: 1.1.10, 1.2.4, 1.2.9, 1.3.15,
1.3.16, 1.3.24, 1.3.25, 2.1.2, 2.1.9, 2.1.12, 2.1.14, 2.1.19, 2.2.1, 2.2.8, 2.2.11, 2.2.12,
2.2.13, 2.3.4, 2.3.6, 2.3.8, 2.3.14, 2.3.15, 2.3.16, 2.3.17, 2.4.6, 3.1.5, 3.1.20, 3.2.10,
3.2.24, 3.2.31, 3.4.5, 3.4.6, 3.4.24, 4.2.16, 4.2.21, and 4.3.13.

88 INTRODUCTION
credible variation of detail, and there is every reason to believe that these
Saṃhitās underwent change in the process of transmission. S.P. Pandit gives a
vivid account of his encounters with a reciter of the AV, Keśava Bhaṭ: “he
was more shocked that the several mss. of that Veda ... exhibited numerous
varieties of reading, and still more horrified when he found that the text he
knew by heart and which was as it had been improved by Gaṇeś Bhaṭ Dādā
was the worse for improvements.” \(AV, VVRI edition, Vol. I, p. xvii\). Pandit
amply demonstrates how the Vaidikas practised what they called Śuddhī-
karaṇa ‘purification, restoration’, and often knew the inherited traditional
reading, besides the improved reading. For the Vaidikas, the results of such a
Śuddhīkaraṇa did not reflect a change from the original, but, on the contrary, a
way of restoring the original. Thus, while in historical terms, a great deal of
change occurred in the transmission of a Śākhā, this change was not admitted
by the Vaidikas, who continuously tried to restore what they thought was the
original. Thus, we cannot maintain any notion of immutability of a Śākhā-text.
7.5.2. Critique of Surya Kanta’s Conclusion 2:
7.5.2.1. While the CA does call itself Śaunakīyā, it would not be ap-
propriate to assume that it provides a picture of the Saṃhitā as it was originally
prepared by Śaunaka himself. The CA claim to the title Śaunakīyā should only
be understood to mean that it respects Śaunaka as the founder of its tradition,
and that it belongs to that school. When it comes to details, the CA openly
admits that it deviates from the opinions of Śaunaka, and hence represents the
Śaunakīya tradition as it had changed over a period of time.
7.5.2.2. For instance, consider CA \(1.1.10, Whitney 1.8: प्रथमान्तानि
तृतीयान्तानीति शौनकस्य प्रतिज्ञानं न वृत्तिः\) and the CAB on this rule: प्रथमान्तानि
पदानि तृतीयान्तानीति शौनकस्य आचार्यस्य प्रतिज्ञानं भवति । न तु वृत्तिः । प्रथमान्
तृतीयान् विद्यात् । न तु पठेत् क्वचित् । वृत्तेरननुदर्शनात्. Śaunaka’s doctrine held that
the voiceless unaspirated stops, occurring at the end of words, should be
changed to voiced unaspirated stops. However, the CA and the CAB both
point out that such a doctrine is not to be applied in actual recitation. Inter-
estingly, Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary on this rule refers to Śākaṭāyana’s
opinion in the RPR \(1.15-16: तस्मादन्यमवसाने तृतीयं गार्ग्यः स्पर्शं प्रथमं शाकटायनः\),
and states: अत्र वेदे तु प्रथमपद्यो गृह्यते शाकटायनानुसरणात्, “Because \[we\] follow
Śākaṭāyana, in \[the recitation of\] this Veda, \[we\] accept the first members of
the stop-series as word-final \[consonants in prepausal situations\].” The lesson
to be learned from this comment is that a tradition claiming itself to be in the
line of Śaunaka felt no hesitation in occasionally deviating from the opinion of

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ  89
Śaunaka, and following the opinions of another scholar like Śākaṭāyana. Thus,
the claim that the CA represents the unsullied views of Śaunaka can not be
entertained.
7.5.3.Critique of Surya Kanta’s Conclusion 3:
7.5.3.1. In most cases, it is true that the rules of the CA deal exclu-
sively with the linguistic facts of the AV. However, this is not true in absolute
terms. Whitney has pointed out numerous cases, where the CA is venturing
into an explanation of the facts of Sanskrit beyond what is attested in the AV.
This probably occurred because the author of the CA had before him general
treatments of Sanskrit at large, and in many cases he drew upon such gener-
alized sources. 
7.5.3.2. For example: CA \(1.3.25, Whitney 1.87: शान्मान्दानाम्\).
While the rule relates to the desiderative forms of three roots, only the forms of
mān are attested in ŚAV. However, these three roots are also grouped together
in P.3.1.6 \(मान्बधदान्शान्भ्यो दीर्घश्चाभ्यासस्य\), and it is very likely that the CA rule
was based on a concern for the general grammar of Sanskrit.
7.5.3.3. Consider CA \(3.4.24, Whitney 3.92: क्षुभ्नादीनाम्\). This rule
refers to a Gaṇa, the Kṣubhnādigaṇa, and says that in these forms the n does
not change to ṇ. However, no forms of kṣubh where this would be applicable
are available in the ŚAV. But notice that Pāṇini 8.4.39 \(क्षुभ्नादिषु च\) prescribes
the same thing and refers to the same Gaṇa. Thus, it is safer to assume that
occasionally the CA was drawing upon generalized grammars of Sanskrit, and
hence occasionally its rules extend beyond the linguistic facts of the AV.
7.5.4.Critique of Surya Kanta’s Conclusion 4:
7.5.4.1. This argument is unacceptable for numerous reasons. As
Surya Kanta himself notes, several Gaṇas referred to in the CA by the first
instance are fully listed in the APR with the same first instance. Similarly, in
95 percent of the cases, the examples quoted in the CAB are simply the first
few instances of long lists found in the APR. This could not have occurred
unless these two texts were somehow genetically linked. 
7.5.4.2. Surya Kanta himself notes that the mss. of the APR are
mostly found in the same bundles which also contain the text of the CA, as
well as many clearly Śaunakīya texts. The colophons in these ms. bundles
indicate that these mss. were copied, preserved and studied by Śaunakīya
families \(e.g. the Pañcolī family of Gujarat\), and the texts of the Vulgate also

90 INTRODUCTION
largely come from these same families. Thus, the Śaunakīyas preserved and
studied both of these texts and they also preserved the Vulgate text of the AV,
and saw no contradiction. 
7.5.4.3. The few cases, where the APR explicitly rejects the
formulation of the CA, and where the mss. of the Vulgate follow the APR
should be accounted for by resorting to linguistic change within a given
tradition over a period of time. Such for instance is the case of CA \(2.3.6,
Whitney 2.65: कुरुकरंकरत्कृणोतुकृतिकृधिष्वकर्णयोः\). As discussed earlier, the
CAB says that the change of visarga to s \(and then to ṣ\) before kr̥ṇotu occurs
only in three instances. However, the APR \(148\) says that one does not
change the visarga to s \(and then to ṣ\) in these three cases. It is possible to
account for these statements as reflecting a possible historical development.
7.5.4.4. Whitney, on this rule, says: “In all these \(= three\) passages,
however, the manuscripts read, without dissent, visarjanīya before the k. ...
Other instances in which kr̥ṇotu has an unaltered visarjanīya before it are
tolerably numerous.” Thus, instead of simply talking about two different re-
censions represented by these two texts, one could make a better case for a
possible historical change within the same tradition:
1\) CA - Unconditional change of visarjanīya to s before kr̥ṇotu.
2\) CAB - This change occurs only in three instances.
3\) APR - The above change does not occur in any instances.
7.5.4.5. Such a general direction of possible change in the oral text is
further supported by the following observations of W.S. Allen \(1953: 51\): “In
later, though still ancient, times there appears to have been a tendency for -ḥ to
extend its usage to contexts other than in pausa. The earliest of these
extensions was to the position before the initial fricatives ś-, ṣ-, s-, where it
replaced the homorganic final -ś, -ṣ, -s \(indraś śūraḥ > indraḥ śūraḥ, &c\). This
practice was then extended to the position before the velar and labial voiceless
stops: in connexion with this innovation we find mentioned the names of
Āgniveśya, Vālmīki, Śākalya, and the Mādhyandina school, whilst the ancient
grammarian Śākaṭāyana is quoted as holding to the more conservative
practice.” Allen also refers to A.H. Fry’s view that “the spread of -ḥ was due
to the writers of Classical Sanskrit operating with a phonemic orthography.”
The last comment is especially significant, since we are dealing with relatively
late manuscripts for editing our texts.

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 91
7.5.5.Critique of Surya Kanta’s Conclusion 5:
7.5.5.1. There is no reason to believe that the CAB is a totally faithful
interpretation of the CA and that it does not add anything to the CA reflecting
either historical change in the transmitted text of the Śaunakīya AV, or new
influences from other grammatical traditions such as that of Pāṇini. 
7.5.5.2. The discussion in the previous section shows a possibility of
a gap between the views held by the CA and the CAB. Here is another
example. On CA \(2.3.3, Whitney 2.62: समासे सकारः कपयोरनन्तःसद्यःश्रेय-
श्छन्दसाम्\), the CAB first discusses all the instances directly referred to by the
CA rule, and finally adds: परः परः । पर इति चाम्रेडितसमासे न सकारो भवति।
‘त्वत् परः परः’ \(अ.वे. १२.३.३९\). This added instance is not covered by the list
of exceptions in the CA rule itself. However, it is covered by the APR \(201\).
Thus, it is possible that this exception was not intended by the author of the
CA, but developed later on and was accounted for by both the CAB and the
APR.
7.5.5.3. In very many cases, the CAB offers lists of examples which
are not found in the AV, but are taken most probably from the Pāṇinian com-
mentaries like the KV. I have already discussed a number of such examples
above in section 6.9.3. Considering the profusion of such non-AV Pāṇinian
examples in the CAB, one cannot agree with Surya Kanta that every example
cited by the CAB, not found in the Vulgate of the AV, must have occurred in
the so-called genuine Śaunakīya recension of the AV. I must also point out
that Whitney had already cited all these Pāṇinian examples from the CAB in his
edition of the CA. However, Surya Kanta remains totally silent about all these
examples. If the CAB can cite all these examples, there is no reason to assume
that every example cited by the CAB must be a genuine AV example. Even an
example like पुना रक्तं वासः in the CAB on CA \(1.1.28, Whitney 1.28\) which is
not traced in the AV, and is ascribed by Surya Kanta to his genuine Śaunakīya
recension, is found in the KV on P.1.3.14 \(रो रि\), and could have been taken
from such a Pāṇinian commentary.
7.5.6.Critique of Surya Kanta’s Conclusion 6:
7.5.6.1. At the very beginning of his Bhāṣya on the first Kāṇḍa of
the AV, Sāyaṇa says:
शाखायाः शौनकीयायाः पूर्वोक्तेष्वेव कर्मसु ।
विनियोगाभिधानेन संहितार्थः प्रकाश्यते ॥

92 INTRODUCTION
“The meaning of the Saṃhitā of the Śaunakīya branch shall be
explained by pointing out its application in the ritual actions
mentioned earlier.”
This makes it clear that in his own opinion, Sāyaṇa was commenting on
the Śaunakīya recension and none other. We should be willing to accept a
strong possibility that, like the separate textual transmission of the Paippalāda
recension in different regions of India, the Śaunakīya recension also underwent
slightly divergent developments in different parts, cf. Mishra, R.C. 1984.
These different sub-schools were not always in touch with each other, and
probably underwent independent Śuddhīkaraṇa ‘purification / restoration’ \(and
a-Śuddhīkaraṇa for that matter\) in different regions. As it has been shown by
Vishva Bandhu and Pandit, such regional traits are manifest in the manuscripts
of the AV. 
“Looking to the nature of the several MSS., I group them as
follows: A, B, C, D, E, R, Sm, Cs, P, P2, J, and Cp, come
from Gujarat, though not from the same original source. They
are untainted by any attempts to revise the tradition of the text
and probably represented the original form of the true tradition
of the text. Bp, Bh, K, Km, V, and Dc, are on the other hand
representatives of the Atharvaveda as it was revised in the
Deccan; where it was introduced about 160 years ago, under the
influence of the school of the R̥gvedins and was further
subjected to changes in relation to the text of Sāyaṇācārya by
Gaṇeś Bhaṭ Dādā after his visit to Śriṅgeri, and his discovery
there of Sāyaṇa’s commentary” \(AV, VVRI edition, Vol. I,
Intro., p. xxvi\).
7.5.6.2. It is also clear that the late commentators of the CA,
Bhārgava-Bhāskara and Kr̥ṣṇadāsa, were unaware of the existence of CAB,
and were working not on CA, but on what they called Kautsa-Vyākaraṇa.
Generally speaking, the CA manuscripts are located in the regions of Gujarat
and Rajasthan. The manuscripts which call their text Kautsa-Vyākaraṇa are
generally located in Ujjain and Deccan. Not a single manuscript of the CA has
been found in the southern parts of India. As Pandit’s introduction shows, the
Deccan tradition of the AV became aware of Sāyaṇa’s commentary at a very
late time, when a Maharashtrian AV reciter visited Śriṅgerī and then became
aware of its existence. It is also not unlikely that the southern tradition of the

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ 93
Śaunakīya AV was not aware of the existence of the CA and its commentaries.
Sāyaṇa’s commentary, which refers to Pāṇini and later grammarians in that
tradition hundreds of times, does not refer either to CA or to APR even once.
Thus, one can make a probable assumption that the text-tradition of the
Śaunakīya AV received by him was not in contact with either the CA or the
APR. However, for that reason, one need not discard his claim that he too was
working with ‘a’ Śaunakīya tradition.
7.6. Surya Kanta’s ‘star example’ Re-examined.
7.6.1. Surya Kanta \(APR, Intro., p. 42\) points to a passage in the
APR which proves conclusively to him that the currently preserved text of the
AV is not that of the true Śaunakīya Saṃhitā. This is a dual reference in APR
\(140c\) and \(3g\) to the passage tannastapaḥ \(AV 12.3.12\). The question is
whether this should be understood as a combination of taṃ naḥ or tat naḥ.
APR \(140c: तन्निष्कुरु तन्निदध्मस्तन्नो भूमे तन्नस्तपस्तन्निर्दहत तन्नो गोपायतास्माकमिति
षण्मकारान्तानि नकाराबाधे\) refers to this passage and says that tannas should be
analyzed as tam naḥ. Referring to the same passage, APR \(3g\) says: शाखान्त-
रेऽपि । तन्नस्तपः । अकारान्तं पुंसि वचनम् । नपुंसकं तकारान्तं शौनके।. Surya Kanta
\(APR, Intro., p. 42\) translates this passage as: “Also in another śākhā of the
AV; tan nas tapaḥ \(12.3.12\); tat, masc., nom. sing. ends in a \(= saḥ\); the same
in neut. ends in t; \(this is so found\) in the school of Śaunaka.” For Surya
Kanta, “The wording is explicit. Śaunakas read in the Pada tat naḥ, against tam
naḥ of the APrŚ. APr. 140c and 3g taken together give: - 1. tam naḥ; APrŚ.;
so SPP. with all his authorities. 2. tat naḥ, Śaunakas; so Whitney with all his
mss.”
7.6.2. What does this passage mean? One must concede that it refers
to an observed difference in the recitation of the Padapāṭha, and that the reading
tat naḥ is ascribed by the author of the APR to a tradition described as
Śaunaka. However, this does not and should not be taken to mean that the
reading tat naḥ belongs to the so-called pure genuine Śaunakīya Saṃhitā which
is now lost. It in fact does not refer to the view of Śaunaka, or directly to the
Padapāṭha as constituted by Śaunaka, but to the tradition as constituted by the
Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā. This is clear from CA \(1.1.10, Whitney 1.8:
प्रथमान्तानि तृतीयान्तानीति शौनकस्य प्रतिज्ञानं न वृत्तिः\) and the commentaries CAB
and Bhārgava-Bhāskara-Vr̥tti. It was Śaunaka’s doctrine that the words
ending in the first members of the stop-series should be recited as ending in the
third members, e.g. tad / naḥ. However, the rule and the commentaries inform
us that such was no longer the practice, and that in the recitation as it was

94 INTRODUCTION
known to the author of the CA, the words were to be recited as ending in the
first members of the stop-series, e.g. tat / naḥ. Bhārgava-Bhāskara, in his
commentary on CA 1.1.10, clearly ascribes the practice of the followers of the
CA to the doctrine of Śākaṭāyana: अत्र वेदे तु प्रथमपद्यो गृह्यते शाकटायनानुसरणात्.
Thus, it is clear that the word śaunaka as used in APR \(3g\) refers not to some
Ur-Śaunakīya recension, now lost, as assumed by Surya Kanta, but to the
followers of the CA, who had openly diverged from the genuine doctrine of
Śaunaka. Additionally, as Surya Kanta notes himself, these two views, e.g.
tam naḥ versus tat naḥ, continued to manifest in the manuscripts of the Vulgate
of the AV, and it is not the case that the manuscripts of the Vulgate took no
notice of the view ascribed to śaunaka by the APR. What this suggests is a
picture of a diversified recitational tradition of the Śaunakīya Saṃhitā. While it
is perfectly appropriate to say that the reading taṃ naḥ was not followed by the
adherents of the CA, the texts as we have them do not distinguish these
readings as some being Śaunakīya and others as non-Śaunakīya. 
7.7. Need for a new approach to the study of the 
transmission of the Veda
7.7.1. To conclude, I would like to say that in order to have a realistic
notion of what happened to the Vedic Saṃhitās as they were transmitted over
centuries in different regions of India, one needs to give up certain stereotypes
regarding the nature of the transmission of the Vedic texts. One need not
belittle the enormous efforts made by the Vaidikas to transmit these texts
without change. However, our critical assessment must not be swayed by such
respect. The Vaidikas who transmitted the Śaunakīya Saṃhitā never thought
that they were changing anything, and yet change did indeed take place. When
they did change something, either this change was unconscious change, or they
thought that they were purifying the text and were restoring the pristine
original. The CA, the CAB, the APR, the various manuscripts, and Sāyaṇa’s
commentary must all be looked at for traces of what transpired during this long
and diversified process of transmission. All these sources are changing
manifestations of the Śaunakīya textual tradition and there is no need to deny
the title ‘Śaunakīya’ to any one of them. Moving away from the unreachable
goal of reaching the Ur-form of the Śaunakīya text, or any other Vedic text for
that matter, we should look at the changing vicissitudes of a Vedic tradition
more carefully. Here, we are more likely to find a realistic historical picture of
what real Vaidikas, copyists, reciters, and interpreters did to a text, which had
no independent existence from what these custodians did to it. This is all the

ŚAUNAKĪYĀ CATURĀDHYĀYIKĀ  95
more significant in the case of the transmission of the Atharvaveda. For
reasons which we cannot discuss here in great detail, the population of
Vaidikas who pursued the Atharvavedic traditions is minuscule at present, in
comparison with the followers of the R̥gveda and Yajurveda, and there is
reason to believe that it was so even in the past. This may have to do with the
historically traceable lower status given to the Atharvaveda by the other
traditions reflected in its early exclusion from the Trayī, and probably also due
to the Ābhicārika rites practiced by the Atharvavedic priests. This is analogous
to the social relations of the Brahmaṇa families who perform the funerary rites,
and the refusal of even the Atharvavedic reciters to recite the funerary hymns
of the Atharvaveda as noted by Pandit. It is indeed the case that the
Atharvaveda that we possess today comes to us from extremely limited
sources. Most manuscripts found in the Gujarat area seem in fact to point to
one single prominent Atharvavedic family, the Pañcolis. From the manuscript
colophons alone one can reconstruct several generations of Pañcolis involved
in the transmission of the Atharvaveda. With very small numbers of reciters,
and often the reciters of the other Vedas taking over the recitation of the
Atharvaveda to cater to the demand for the Ābhicārika rites \(as reported to me
by the late Pt. Nārāyaṇa Śāstrī Raṭāṭe of Banaras\), the transmission has indeed
suffered through the ages, and hence the Atharvaveda material we possess is in
a relatively less authentic state in comparison with other Vedic traditions. In
any case, we possess enough material to trace the development of the
Atharvaveda transmission in various regions of Western and Southern India.
Any detailed discussion of such efforts lies clearly outside the scope of this
Introduction. However, the interpretation and the transmission of the CA and
the transmission of the Śaunakīya Atharvaveda have been closely related to
each other, and this edition hopes to further a clearer understanding of these
relations.

Whitney \(1.1\). Found in B, D, E, F, Hb, I, J, K, L, Nab, O, and P.
Translation: Here are defined the \[phonetic/phonological\]
characteristics of nouns, verbs, prepositions, and particles, the
four types of words, as they occur in combination \[with the
following words, as in the Saṃhitāpāṭha\] and before pause \[or
in isolation, as in the Padapāṭha\].
Note: The word prātijñam refers to the notion of pratijñāna \(cf. CA
1.1.10\), and this refers to a doctrine or a view explicitly held or stated by a
teacher, in contrast with vr̥tti “recitational practice.” In most cases, the pratijñā
and the vr̥tti are expected to agree with each other. However, this is not always
the case. There is a general expectation that the Prātiśākhyas take the existence
of the Padapāṭha for granted and then teach the rules for converting the
Padapāṭha into Saṃhitāpāṭha. Such an expectation is created by the statement
पदप्रकृतिः संहिता \(NR 1.17; RPR 2.1: संहिता पदप्रकृतिः\). This statement is inter-
preted in two opposite ways. The first interpretation is that the Saṃhitāpāṭha is
the basis for the Padapāṭha. This is historically valid, since the Padapāṭha is an
analysis of the words of the Saṃhitāpāṭha. However, the more commonly
accepted interpretation is that the Saṃhitāpāṭha has the Padapāṭha for its basis,
i.e. the Saṃhitāpāṭha is derived by applying the rules of Sandhi to the Pada-
pāṭha. With this interpretation in mind, one expects the Prātiśākhyas to provide

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका99
rules for converting the Padapāṭha into the Saṃhitāpāṭha, and not the other way
around. However, as Whitney \(1862: 10\) notes: “Our own work gives in its
fourth chapter the rules for the construction of the pada-text itself, as does also
the Vājasaneyi Prātiśākhya.” This is more in line with the neutral statement of
the present rule. It lays equal emphasis on the sandhya characteristics, as well
as the padya characteristics. This is clear in its use of the dual forms: सन्ध्यपद्यौ
गुणौ \(प्रातिज्ञम्\). In general, the Prātiśākhyas are not concerned with the full
derivation of grammatical forms, as are the grammars of Sanskrit. This
contrast is brought out by the commentary Caturādhyāyībhāṣya. Also see
Whitney’s comments on TPR \(3.1, pp. 82ff\): “In the other treatises \(Rik Pr
vii.-ix., Vāj. Pr. iii. 95-128, Ath. Pr. iii.1-25\), the rules tell us in what situations
a vowel originally short is lengthened: This is more in accordance with the
general method of the Prātiśākhyas, which take for granted, upon the whole,
the existence of their Śākhās in the analyzed condition of the pada-text, and
proceed to construct the saṃhitā from it. Here, on the contrary, we are told
what vowels, long in the ordinary text, are to be shortened when thrown out of
combination with their surroundings. Such dissolution of the continuity of the
text takes place, first, in pada, whenever a pause - either the avagraha sepa-
rating the two members of a compound, in its repetition after iti, or the longer
pause that divides between two words - comes to stand between the vowel in
question and the consonant which was its next neighbour in saṃhitā.” I thank
Prof. Cardona for drawing my attention to this section of the TPR.

Note: Whitney \(1862: 11\) expresses some doubt as to whether the
commentator here refers to Pāṇini or to some other authority. The expressions
used are so obviously Pāṇinian, that we need not entertain any such doubt.
The CAB is fully conversant with Pāṇini, and by the term vyākaraṇa, it refers
to Pāṇini alone. Compare the CAB on the next rule. This need not mean that
the CA itself necessarily presupposes Pāṇini. However, the commentatorial
tradition is firmly rooted in the awareness of Pāṇini’s grammar as the grammar
par excellence.

Whitney \(1.2\), Ha, I, Na: एवमिहेति च विभाषाप्राप्तं सामान्ये. B, D, E, F, J,

Translation: \[This treatise\] also \[defines that the phonetic/
phonological features of the words\] in this \[tradition\] are such
and such.
Note: Whitney combines this rule with the following one in a single
rule, following the CAB. However, having done that, he still feels that the rule
is “somewhat obscure and of difficult construction” \(Whitney 1862, p. 11\). He
then refers to Max MÜller’s rendering of this rule \(M. MÜller, RPR, p. xii\):
“what by the grammatical text books is left free, that is here thus and thus, so
says the Prātiśākhya.” Whitney criticizes this interpretation by saying that “it
leaves the ca unexplained, and supposes the iti to be in another place, making
the rule to read rather evam iha vibhāṣāprāptaṃ sāmānya iti; ... It seems
necessary, in order to account for ca, to bring down prātijñam as general
predicate from the preceding rule; and the iti must be understood as pointing
out that the Prātiśākhya says evam iha, ‘so and so is proper here,’ respecting
any matter which the rules of grammar leave doubtful” \(Whitney, 1862, p. 11\).
Whitney is correct in bringing down the word prātijñam from the previous rule
to give a better account of ca in this rule. However, such an interpretation fits
better if the portion ending in ca is a separate rule, as the majority of mss. now
indicate. Additionally, the rule is not obscure, and its interpretation is further
assisted by the fact of it being quoted by Uvaṭa in his introduction to the RPR
\(M.D. Shastri edn., Part II, p. 23\) in a discussion of the exact relation between
the Prātiśākhya tradition and the tradition of grammar. However, Whitney
does make a problematic statement: “it \(= CA\) does not at all imply or base
itself upon the general science of grammar and its text book, but is an
independent and a complete treatise as regards its own subject.” While it is an

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका101
independent treatise, it clearly assumes the prior existence of general grammars
of Sanskrit, and seems to imply that it is related to the general science of
grammar as a statement of particular features of a Veda branch would relate to
a generic description of Sanskrit at large.

Translation: \[These phonetic/phonological features of the

Note: This rule contrasts the function of a generic grammar of
Sanskrit with that of a Prātiśākhya. A Prātiśākhya ideally aims at strictly de-
scribing the linguistic features of words as they occur in a particular Vedic
Saṃhitā text, and , therefore, it is expected to be highly specific. A general
grammar of Sanskrit, on the other hand, is expected to cover all the different
textual traditions and dialects of colloquial Sanskrit, and hence it ends up
making optional statements. This precisely accords with Patañjali’s explana-
tion as to why Pāṇini was forced to use different option-terms. \(सर्ववेदपारिषदं

found at all in either of the Yajur-Veda Prātiśākhyas, or in Pāṇini, and in the
Rik Prātiśākhya it means ‘member of a compound word.’” By its etymology,
the word would simply mean ‘belonging to a pada,’ and hence the need for a
precise definition.

Note: All the manuscripts share the mistaken reading अनृकारः. How-
ever, I agree with Whitney’s reading. As the CAB clearly shows, the only
excluded vowel is l̥. Whitney \(1862: 12\) provides information on how several
other Prātiśākhyas also exclude l̥ from the sounds which may occur at the end
of words, i.e. padas in the Padapāṭha.

Note: While the ms. H reads brahmā, the ms. N reads brahma, and
this is the reading chosen by Whitney. It seems to be the correct reading in
view of the fact that the commentary is clearly offering examples of short and
long vowels in a fixed sequence. This would make the reading brahmā
unsuitable. The word nīlam is found in AV \(14.2.48\), and nīlena is found in
AV \(15.1.8\). However, the VVRI concordance does not record any occur-
rence of nīlā in the Vedic Saṃhitās. Whitney \(1862: 12\) appropriately notes
that r̥ appears only at the end of the first member of a compound, or before a
case affix, but not exactly at the end of inflected words. This reminder is
important in view of the fact that the word pada, though not defined in this text,

104अध्याय १, पाद १
applies not only to inflected nominal and verbal items, it also covers nominal
bases as they appear in compounds and before certain case terminations. The
Padapāṭha typically separates members of compounds, and nominal bases
before bh- initial case terminations and -su. The sound r̥ does appear in such
environments, and, therefore, it is legitimately a padya sound.

says that members of the c-series cannot occur pada-finally. Whitney \(1862:
13\) gives a detailed account of which stops are more or less frequent in the
pada-final position. Also compare: VPR \(i. 85\), and RPR \(xii. 1\).

Note: Since only the firsts and the lasts of the stop-series qualify to
occur at the end of words according to CA 1.1.8, one needs to exclude only c
and ñ, and not the whole c-series. Perhaps the expression cavargaḥ is felt to be
more economical as compared to the expression cakārañakārau. The notion of
economy often applies at the level of expression, rather than reference.

Note: The incomplete initial word of the Bhārgava-Bhāskara-Vr̥tti is
most likely sparśānām. Thus, the commentary makes it explicit, that among the
stops, only eight stops may occur at the end of the padas. Concerning the
word-final ṅ, Whitney \(1862: 13\) points out that it “appears only as final of
masculine nominatives singular of derivatives of the root añc.” Note that
Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s example is pratyaṅ. The example śīrṣaṇ-vatīm offered
by Bhārgava-Bhāskara is important, because, as Whitney \(1862: 13\) notes: “ṇ,
\[occurs\] only in a few instances, at the end of the first member of a compound,
where, by a specific rule \(iv. 99 = CA 4.3.28\), it is left in the pada in its
saṃhitā form.” Whitney himself came up with the example ब्रह्म॑ण्वतीम् \(ŚAV
vi.108.2\). It is difficult to see why Bhārgava-Bhāskara could not find an
example in the ŚAV. The form शी॒र्ष॒ण्वती॑, not शीर्षण्वतीम्, is attested in ŚAV
\(10.1.2\).

Note: Bhārgava-Bhāskara adds some important information, namely
that while the CA mentions the opinion of Śaunaka, it does not follow its prac-
tice, and that the practice of the AV tradition follows the view of Śākaṭāyana.
In view of the fact that we are dealing with the so-called Śaunakīya AV, it is
curious to find that the surviving tradition follows the view, not of Śaunaka,
but that of Śākaṭāyana. While the CA mentions Śākaṭāyana’s views in other
contexts, e.g. CA 2.1.24 \(लेशवृत्तिरधिस्पर्शं शाकटायनस्य\), it does not do so in this
case. The view, which the commentator attributes to Śākaṭāyana, is simply
assumed to be the default view. The citation of the RPR in Bhārgava-
Bhāskara’s commentary shows that Śaunaka’s view was also shared by
Gārgya. 
This rule provides a fitting answer to Surya Kanta’s excessive claims
about the Śaunakīya-ness of this text. It is indeed called Śaunakīyā Caturā-
dhyāyīikā and no doubt belongs to the tradition of Śaunaka. At the same time,
one must keep in mind that this tradition was not immutable, and in the course
of time, it came to adopt in practice the doctrines of other sages like Śākaṭā-
yana, which were historically at variance with the views of Śaunaka. Also see
CA 4.1.52, and the CAB on that rule.

भा.भा.वृत्ति - वर्गाणां ये प्रथमास्तृतीयाश्च ते वर्णा अधि-
स्पर्शसंज्ञका ज्ञेयाः ।
Note: This rule is indeed somewhat unclear. Part of the reason for
this lack of clarity is that the expression adhisparśam is extremely rare in the
Sanskrit phonetic literature. It has been used adverbially in CA 2.1.24 \(लेश-
वृत्तिरधिस्पर्शं शाकटायनस्य\), and etymologically it can simply mean “as regards
contact.” There are several possible interpretations.
a\) This interpretation is supported by the CAB. According to this in-
terpretation, the rule simply means: “Adhisparśa is also a precept of Śaunaka,
though such is not the recitational practice.” Then, for the meaning of the term
अधिस्पर्शम्, we are referred to CA 2.1.24 \(लेशवृत्तिरधिस्पर्शं शाकटायनस्य\). Accord-
ing to this rule, in the opinion of Śākaṭāyana, the euphonic y and v were pro-
nounced slightly \(= लेशवृत्तिः\) as regards contact \(अधिस्पर्शम्\), i.e. as weak glides.
The same view is then ascribed to Śaunaka in the present rule. Such an inter-
pretation seems less likely, because it would be unnatural that the text would
refer a certain view to Śaunaka in one place and to Śākaṭāyana in another place.
b\) What seems more likely is that the expression अधिस्पर्शम् is used as
an abbreviation for the longer phrase लेशवृत्तिरधिस्पर्शम् found in CA 2.1.24. The
phrase then refers to “partial or incomplete articulation.” With this generic
meaning, one may assume that rule CA 1.1.11 \(अधिस्पर्शम् च\) is more closely
connected to the doctrine as taught in CA 1.1.10. It could then be interpreted to
mean: According to the precept of Śaunaka, the padas ending in the first
members of the stop-series should rather end in the third members of the stop-
series, and that these third members, i.e. voiced unaspirated stops, are articu-
lated incompletely or partially, i.e. without their contact being released. This is
my preferred interpretation.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका109
Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary proposes that both the firsts and
thirds of the stop-series were called अधिस्पर्श according to Śaunaka. Presuma-
bly they were all pronounced with a weak articulation according to Śaunaka,
though such was not the recitational practice supported by the CA. This inclu-
sion of both the categories has no textual support, though in terms of the gen-
eral history of Indo-Aryan, all final stops are weak, see: R.L. Turner \(1960:
11-19\).
According to Allen \(1953: 70\), this rule, taken along with the previous
one, “is perhaps to be interpreted as indicating a realization as voiceless stops,
but with the lax articulation characteristic of the voiced stops.” It is not clear to
me whether the term अधिस्पर्शम् indicates ‘lax articulation characteristic of the
voiced stops.’ I think that this term is more like an equivalent of लघुप्रयत्नतर
“having a lighter articulatory effort” or लेशवृत्तिः “a reduced articulation.” It is
most probably the non-release of the closure making it a weak articulation,
rather than a lax articulation. There is a clearer reason for not accepting Allen’s
interpretation. The rule is not trying to make a generic distinction between
voiceless and voiced stops, but a distinction between final voiced stops versus
non-final voiced stops. Since all voiced stops have the feature of laxness, one
cannot use this feature to distinguish between final and non-final voiced stops.
On the other hand, it is clear that while one cannot have unreleased non-final
voiced stops, it is possible to have unreleased final voiced stops. Allen also
does not recognize the fact that the rules refer to actual recitational or articula-
tory differences, and not mere theoretical differences. He \(1953: 70\) renders
them as: “Words ending \(sc. according to orthodox doctrine\) in voiceless
stops, end according to Śaunaka in voiced stops, but they are not so treated \(sc.
phonologically\); they have lax contact.” As we have noted above, this is not a
phonological distinction, but a distinction in recitational practice, and the term
vr̥tti refers to articulation in recitation.
Whitney \(1862: 15\) did think of another possibility: “Or is adhisparśa
to be interpreted as the name of a slighted or imperfect utterance, and did
Śaunaka teach such an utterance as belonging to a final mute, which wavered,
as it were, between sonant and surd? This appears somewhat more plausible,
but not sufficiently so to be accepted as at all satisfactory: there is no question
of a difference of contact of the organs \(sparśa\) in such a case.” I do not
believe that the CA refers to such a wavering pronunciation. It rather refers to
two different practices consistently followed by different schools of reciters.
However, I agree with Whitney that the term अधिस्पर्शम् is used to refer to
incomplete articulation. Whitney \(1862: 16\) also refers to Weber’s conjecture
that the passage means that “when the padyas enter into sandhi, they are to be

110अध्याय १, पाद १
converted into tr̥tīyas before nasals \(e.g. tad me, not tan me\): but this is only
pratijñānam, not vr̥tti.” Whitney rejects this interpretation. However, the last
part of Weber’s interpretation, “but this is only pratijñānam, not vr̥tti,” is sup-
ported by the commentary CAB. That means that, like the precept of Śaunaka
taught in the previous rule, this rule also teaches a precept of Śaunaka, which is
not carried out in the recitational practice. If this is true, then it cannot refer to
the weakening of euphonic y and v, since that is part of the recitational practice
\(cf. CA 2.1.24: लेशवृत्तिरधिस्पर्शं शाकटायनस्य\). 
I take the rule to refer to the weakening or non-release of the final
voiced unaspirated stops. Śaunaka evidently supported the weak pronunciation
of the final voiced unaspirated stops, while the recitational practice maintained
the voiceless unaspirated stops at the end of words. The weakening of final
stops in general can draw support from what happens in the Prakrit languages,
see R.L. Turner \(1960: 11-19\). All final stops are lost in Prakrit, except the
nasals are retained in some form or another for a much longer time. It is likely
that the recitational practice, perceiving the danger of losing the weak
consonants, went in the other direction and strengthened them. Devoicing may
have been seen as a move in the direction of preservation. The medial
voiceless stops were voiced in most Prakrits, and then were lost in some, as in
Mahārāṣṭrī. However, the voiced medial stops were devoiced in the
northwestern Paiśācī where they were preserved and protected from loss. For
HinÜber \(1981: 127\) this Paiśācī feature is purely orthographical “without any
bearing on Paiśācī phonetics.” I am yet to be convinced by this argument.
१.१.१२. द्वितीयचतुर्थाः सोष्माणः ।
Whitney \(1.10\). A, B, D, I \(orig\), J, L, M \(corr\), O: सोष्मणः.
Translation: The seconds and the fourths \[in the five stop-
series\] are termed soṣman “aspirated \[stops, lit. combined with
a spirant\].”
Note: The term soṣman literally means “with ūṣman.” Most of the
later commentators on phonetic treatises interpret the term to mean “with
aspiration,” and take the term ūṣman to refer to aspiration, cf. अन्वर्थसंज्ञेयम् ।
ऊष्मा वायुस्तेन सह वर्तन्त इति सोष्माणः, Uvaṭa on RPR 1.13. On the other hand, a
more historically apt interpretation is suggested by the ancient Śikṣā text quoted
in the CAB. According to this view, the aspirated stops are born through a
combination of the unaspirated stop with a voiced or voiceless spirant. Thus,
at an earlier period, the term soṣman probably meant “combined with a

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका111
spirant,” rather than “combined with aspiration.” Compare RPR \(13.16-17\):
सोष्मतां च सोष्मणामूष्मणाहुः सस्थानेन ॥ \(एके\) घोषिणां घोषिणैव ॥ The simple fact is
that these are different views. However, I believe that the view of soṣman as
“combined with a spirant” must be the earlier view, since the term ūṣman as it
is attested in its oldest occurrence in the Aitareya-Āraṇyaka \(2.2.4, 3.2.1\) and
the Chāndogya-Upaniṣad \(2.22.2\) already seems to refer not to aspiration as
such, but to spirants. Thus, historically, it is more likely that the term soṣman
first meant “combined with a spirant,” and then, in certain schools, came to
mean “with aspiration.” The interpretation “with aspiration” fails to account for
the difference between the groups denoted by the terms ūṣman and soṣman,
and points more closely in the direction of the later term mahāprāṇa, which
does not distinguish between these two sub-groups.

Note: Bhārgava-Bhāskara offers a more simplistic view. All aspirated
stops are produced by a combination of a non-aspirated stop with pulmonary h
\(= aurasya-hakāra\). Bhārgava-Bhāskara further adds an important clarification.
Even though the proposed explanation regards aspirated stops as combinations
of unaspirated stops with h, the commentator hastens to add that the combina-
tion is not regarded as a consonant-cluster, because the h sound which is added
is a sound with a weaker effort \(laghu-prayatna-tara\). Thus, a short vowel pre-
ceding such an aspirated stop does not become a heavy \(guru\) syllable. A

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका113
better explanation, of course, is that the aspiration, or the h- sound, is not an
added sound, but is part of the basic phonation \(anupradāna\), cf. Taittirīya-
Prātiśākhya \(2.6: मध्ये हकारः\). However, Bhārgava-Bhāskara does not worry
about explaining the difference between voiced and voiceless aspirated stops.
The interpretation found in the CAB offers an explanation of this difference.

Note: Compare the usage of the terms prathama and uttama in Pāṇini,
outside of the context of phonetic lists, referring to the third and the first person
forms in the verbal paradigms, cf. Pāṇini 1.4.101 \(तिङस्त्रीणि त्रीणि प्रथममध्यमो-
त्तमाः\). The term prathama refers to the group which appears first in the list,
while the term uttama refers to the group which appears at the end of the list.
Thus, Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s paraphrase of the term uttama by antya offers the
clearest interpretation. One should also note that while the term anunāsika is
used here to refer to the final members of the stop-series, i.e. ṅ, ñ, ṇ, n, and m,
it is used elsewhere more generically to include the nasal vowels, cf. CA 1.3.6
and CA 1.3.8. Generally, the term anunāsika refers to those sounds which
involve both the oral and nasal passages in their articulation, cf. CA 1.1.27
\(अनुनासिकानां मुखनासिकम्\) and P.1.1.9 \(मुखनासिकावचनोऽनुनासिकः\), and this often
leaves sounds like the anusvāra and nāsikya uncovered by this term.
१.१.१४. श्वासोऽघोषेष्वनुप्रदानः ।
Whitney \(1.12\). G: 1.1.14.

114अध्याय १, पाद १
Translation: In the case of voiceless \[consonants\], the \[type
of\] phonation \[or emission\] is śvāsa ‘\[voiceless, non-resonant\]
breath.’
Note: The term anupradāna raises a number of conceptual and
historical problems. While Whitney generally renders this term by ‘emitted
material,’ he also mentions the view of the RPR \(xiii. 2\) that śvāsa and nāda are
prakr̥ti ‘material cause,’ or the original phonic material out of which the
different sounds are fashioned. Whitney offers another translation of the term
anupradāna as ‘a giving along forth, a continuous emission.’ 
In my view, in the period which predated the formation of the available
phonetic treatises, the anupradāna view originally contrasted with the prakr̥ti
view, and these two terms referring to the same phenomenon, in all likelihood,
originally represented two somewhat different perspectives on the phonic
material covered by the terms śvāsa and nāda. Instead of the meaning ‘along
with,’ the term more directly stands for ‘that which is subsequently
contributed.’ Such a notion does not make sense in terms of our modern
notions of the process of articulation. However, in ancient India, there did
exist a school of phonetics which argued that anupradāna is like the resounding
vibrations of the sound of a bell. The clearest exposition of this view is found
in the Āpiśaliśikṣā: “However, others say: When nāda ‘resonant air-stream’ is
subsequently contributed to the sound produced by the contact of the point of
articulation and the articulator, then through the mixture of nāda and that sound,
ghoṣa ‘voice’ is produced. When śvāsa ‘non-resonant air-stream’ is subse-
quently contributed \[to the sound produced by the contact of the point of
articulation and the articulator\], then through the mixture of śvāsa and that
sound, the aghoṣa ‘voiceless sound’ is produced,” अन्ये तु ब्रुवते । तत्र यदा
स्थानकरणाभिघातजे ध्वनौ नादोऽनुप्रदीयते, तदा नादध्वनिसंसर्गाद्घोषो जायते, यदा तु श्वासोऽ-
नुप्रदीयते, तदा श्वासध्वनिसंसर्गादघोषो जायते, Āpiśaliśikṣā, cited by K.C. Chatterji
\(1964: 240\). This view cited by the Āpiśaliśikṣā as the view of some other
scholars \(अपरे तु ब्रुवते\) goes hand in hand with the etymological meaning of the
term anupradāna, and may have had a different significance as compared to the
prakr̥ti view represented by the RPR, TPR etc. 
Supporting evidence for such an interpretation of the original meaning
of the term anupradāna may be extracted from some ancient practices of silent
or rather airless recitation \(upāṃśu\). In the Brāḥmaṇa literature, a priest is
often advised to perform the recitation of a certain Mantra in an upāṃśu
fashion. For example, the Aitareya-Brāhmaṇa \(1.27, Anandashrama edn., Pt.
I, p. 115\) says: तस्मादुपांशु वाचा चरितव्यम्, ‘one should, therefore, act with one’s

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका115
speech in an upāṃśu fashion.’ Sāyaṇa explains this as: यथा परैर्ध्वनिर्न श्रूयते तथा
‘in such a way that others will not hear the sound.’ This does not mean that
one should recite the Mantra simply in one’s mind. In the specific upāṃśu
mode, one does all the movements of the articulatory organs, except that there
is no sound coming out, i.e. there is no phonation. Böhtlingk and Roth in their
PW on this term cite passages which clearly distinguish between an upāṃśu
recitation from a mānasa ‘mental’ recitation. A more technical explanation of
the term upāṃśu is found in the definition: करणवदशब्दममनःप्रयोगमुपांशु \(TPR
23.6\): “Upāṃśu is without sound, without application of mind, but with
articulating action.” The commentary Tribhāṣyaratna paraphrases the word
karaṇavat by prayatnavat, and says that this is given specifically to distinguish
this form of recitation from silence: करणवदिति तूष्णींभावनिवृत्त्यर्थम्. This
conception is very important, because it divides the articulatory process into
two parts, phonation and the movements of the articulatory organs. Since the
upāṃśu mode of recitation clearly assumes the presence of the movements of
the articulatory organs without the presence of phonation, one can extrapolate
that the addition of phonation leads to a recitation which then becomes audible.
Most likely, it is this type of recitational practice which led to the perception of
phonation as a secondary or an add-on feature. This closely corresponds to
one of the two descriptions of anupradāna given by the Āpiśaliśikṣā, as
something that is added on to the sound produced by the contact of an
articulator and a point of articulation
Such an older meaning for the term anupradāna is made likely by the
use of the verb anu\+pra\+dā in the Vedic literature. For instance, the TS
\(2.2.1.4-5\) reads: पषा वा इ॑न्द्रि॒यस्य॑ वी॒र्य॑स्यानुप्रदा॒ता पू॒षण॑मे॒व स्वेन॑ भाग॒धेये॒नोप॑ धावति॒ स
ए॒वास्मा॒॑ इन्द्रियं॒ वीर्य॑मनु॒ प्र य॑च्छति, “Pūṣan is the giver of power and strength,
verily he \(= sacrificer\) has recourse to Pūṣan with his own share; verily he \(=
Pūṣan\) gives to him power and strength.” The previous passage speaks:
“Verily Indra and Agni he has recourse to with their own share; verily they
two place power and strength in him; with power and strength he approaches
the battle and conquers in it \(TS 2.2.1.3\).” Thus, the verb anu-pra-dā is used
in the sense of contributing something to someone who does not already have
it. Also see MS \(2.1.1\). The word rasānupradāna also occurs twice in
Yāska’s Nirukta \(7.10, 10.34\). In the first occurrence \(NR 7.10\), Sarup
translates it by ‘release’ of waters \[by Indra by means of slaying of the demon
Vr̥tra\], and in the second occurrence, as ‘gift of juice.’
This also goes along with my suggestion \(cf. Introduction, 3.2.2\) that
in the formative stages of Sanskrit phonetics, the distinction between the points
of articulation of sounds was probably understood earlier than the distinction

116अध्याय १, पाद १
between voiced/voiceless consonants, and aspirated/unaspirated consonants.
This is what may have allowed some early traditions to view, for example, k as
the representative consonant, which subsequently came to be differentiated
between k, kh, g, gh etc. through various combinations of primitive sounds. A
similar view is found in the Śikṣā verses cited on CA \(1.1.12\). Also see RPR
\(13.5-6\), and Deshpande \(1976\). Thus, the notion of voicing, aspiration, and
nasality as added features to a basic non-nasal voiceless unaspirated consonant
is a fairly old conception, and it occurs independently of the concerns of the
definition of homogeneity \(sāvarṇya\) in these texts. Also compare the term
anunāsika to anupradāna; both share the prefix anu, and probably both hint at
the ‘add-on’ character of these features as conceived by some of these old
traditions.
However, it looks as if the term anupradāna soon lost its original ety-
mological meaning and was shared by most of the schools, including the ones
which espoused the prakr̥ti view. This is also clear from the Āpiśaliśikṣā itself,
where the other school does not subscribe to the ‘subsequent’ character of nāda
and ghoṣa, and yet calls them anupradāna. In these traditions, the term anu-
pradāna has been understood differently. George Cardona \(personal commu-
nication\) suggests that in traditions such as the TPR \(2.4-10: संवृते कण्ठे नादः
क्रियते। विवृते श्वासः । मध्ये हकारः । ता वर्णप्रकृतयः । नादोऽनुप्रदानः स्वरघोषवत्सु।
हकारो हचतुर्थेषु। अघोषेषु श्वासः\) the word “anupradāna could be derived with
lyuṭ denoting either an instrument or an object: that by which the sounds are
produced or that which is emitted in producing the sounds.” This is in accor-
dance with the interpretation of the term anupradāna as given by the commen-
tary Tribhāṣyaratna on TPR \(2.8\): अनुप्रदीयतेऽनेन वर्ण इत्यनुप्रदानं मूलकारणम् ।
अनुप्रदीयते उपादीयते जन्यत इत्यर्थः ।
However, one may note that the most likely earlier etymological mean-
ing of the term anupradāna as an ‘added or subsequently contributed factor’ is
eventually picked up by the later texts when they use the term bāhyaprayatna
‘external effort’ to refer to these types of phonation. While most scholars have
translated the term anupradāna by ‘phonic material,’ Allen \(1953: 23\) renders it
by ‘secondary feature,’ thus capturing the etymological significance of the
term. Following the lead of Patañjali and the Āpiśaliśikṣā, he lists anupradāna
under ‘extra-buccal processes’ \(bāhyaprayatna\). While this accurately repre-
sents the view of Patañjali and the Āpiśaliśikṣā, we must keep in mind that
such a global division of internal versus external efforts is not common to the
Prātiśākhyas. And yet, as has been hinted above, the term anupradāna in its
etymological meaning may have implied the secondary or external nature of
this feature. 

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका117
A somewhat different explanation is suggested by Cardona \(personal
communication\): “Given that the Taittirīya- and R̥kprātiśākhyas very deliber-
ately and carefully distinguish between descriptions of speech production and
statement of phonological entities, I think it wise to accept that anupradāna was
used as equivalent to prakr̥ti with reference to śvāsa, nāda and their combina-
tion \(hakāra in TPR terms\). The other view, which takes anupradāna as refer-
ring to features added to basic sounds is obviously based on the primacy of
ābhyantaraprayatna with respect to savarṇa sets. ... The RPR/TPR descriptions
do indeed describe the articulatory process. The alternative way, wherein one
has a basic sound defined by sthāna and prayatna to which anupradānas are
added, is patently a blend of phonetics and phonological considerations.” For a
detailed argument in this direction, see: Cardona \(1986\).
We may also point out that some texts use the term anupradāna as an
adjective for the terms śvāsa and nāda, and hence in these texts the word
appears in the masculine gender. However, other texts, such as the Āpiśali-
śikṣā \(8.11, Yudhishthir Mīmāṃsaka edition: तौ श्वासनादावनुप्रदानमित्याचक्षते\), use
the term in the neuter gender, indicating that it is used as a substantive. In any
case, there is no doubt about the reference of the term.

Note: The categorization of the various types of anupradāna as types
of bāhyaprayatna is not relevant to the Prātiśākhya tradition, but is a reflection
of the influence of the Pāṇinian school. The commentator brings in categories
from the Pāṇinian school to explain the usage of the Prātiśākhya. To some
extent, this is indicative of the fact that the Prātiśākhya traditions, in the course
of time, became secondary traditions, and had to be explained in terms of the
main-stream paradigm of Pāṇinian grammar. The distinction between bāhya-
prayatna and ābhyantaraprayatna is relevant to the definition of homogeneity
within the Pāṇinian school, but has little relevance to the Prātiśākhya tradition,
Cf. Deshpande \(1975: 11\).
There is also an important assertion made in the verse cited by the
Caturādhyāyībhāṣya and in Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary that the yamas
or the nasalized twins or transitional nasal allophones of voiceless sounds like
k and kh are also voiceless. Interestingly, the CAB itself does not list these
voiceless yamas. On the other hand, the CAB on the next rule explicitly lists
the voiced yamas: g̐ and g̐h. One does not quite know whether the notion of
voiceless yamas was felt to be somewhat uncomfortable. While other Prāti-
śākhyas do list yamas for k, kh etc., there is no explicit indication that these are
voiceless. While Whitney \(1862: 18\) does refer to the sonant nasalized twins
for g and gh, he does not mention the fact that the nasalized twins for k, kh etc.
are listed by the verse cited in the CA as voiceless consonants. In fact, for
some reason, Whitney does not refer to the verse cited in that commentary at
all, even though it does occur in the ms. of the CAB which was available to
him.

Translation: In the case of voiced \[consonants\] and vowels,
the \[type of\] phonation \[or emission\] is nāda ‘resonance.’
Note: For a critique of Max MÜller’s and Whitney’s refusal to accept
the voiced h, and the combination of voice and aspiration in sounds like gh, jh,
ḍh, dh, and bh, and the subsequent rebuttal of this early misunderstanding, see:
Allen \(1953: 35ff\). The notion of ‘breathy voice’ is now commonplace in
modern phonetics, see: Peter Ladefoged \(1971: 12-13; 1973\).

Note: The statement of this rule as well as similar rules in other
Prātiśākhyas raise the legitimate question of whether the terms nāda and ghoṣa
are co-extensive with each other. Literally interpreted, the rule would seem to
suggest that, while vowels and the ghoṣavat consonants share the feature of
nāda, the separate mention of ghoṣavat consonants, apart from vowels, seems
to suggest at least a possibility that vowels may not have the feature of ghoṣa.
The question boils down to this. Is there a phonetic distinction intended
between the notions of nāda and ghoṣa, or is this distinction in some sense
phonological and not phonetic? This has led to a lively debate among scholars,
cf. Deshpande, \(1976\); Cardona, \(1983, 1986\), and Stautzebach \(1994: 287\).
The commentary of Bhārgava-Bhāskara has been clearly misled by a
wrong reading for the rule, i.e. नादोऽघोषवत्परेषु. Such a reading presumes the
existence of the term aghoṣavat. While the term ghoṣavat is a common term, its
opposite is always aghoṣa, and not aghoṣavat. It also comes up with an

120अध्याय १, पाद १
interpretation which excludes vowels from having the feature of nāda. Such a
view is not at all acceptable, and it simply shows a deteriorating state of
phonetic scholarship reflected in this late commentary. Such a view originates
in a certain misunderstanding due to the fact that the emission-features are
relegated to the category of bāhyaprayatna ‘external effort,’ and the external
effort features are useful in the Pāṇinian phonology only in the context of
selecting a substitute with maximal featural proximity \(āntaratamya\). Since, in
practical terms, such a consideration of substitutes, in terms of external efforts,
applies only to the substitutes for consonants, one develops a misperception
that vowels do not have the emission features. This misguided view has been
articulated by several late texts, cf. the following statement from Pandit
Jagadīśācārya Citrācārya \(1969: 13\): तत्रोदात्तानुदात्तस्वरितास्त्रयः स्वराणामेव सर्वेषाम् ।

\(APR, Introduction, p. 40\), on the other hand, believes that the ms. reading is
probably the genuine Śaunakīya reading, and that it is not found in the
currently known Vulgate of the AV, because it is not the genuinely Śaunakīya
recension.
Allen \(1953: 89\) particularly commends the CA for making an impor-
tant specification in this rule: “the AP, in describing the udātta as high and the
anudātta as low, made the important specification, ‘within the same register’ \(=
samānayame\); the pitches, that is to say, are relative and not absolute - a point
which is specifically made by Patañjali: The terms ‘high’ and ‘low’ have no
absolute signification.” For a detailed discussion of the term ākṣipta, see: Allen
\(1953: 87-88\). It is not simply the falling tone, but it carries the meaning of
thrusting down.

Note: Following the Pāṇinian school, Bhārgava-Bhāskara says that
there is no long l̥̄ in the usage of Sanskrit. Interestingly, Bhārgava-Bhāskara
refers to different head movements of the reciter to indicate different accents.
The anudātta is indicated by the lowering of the head. The udātta is indicated
by the slight raising of the head. The svarita is indicated by raising the head
even higher to look upwards to the heaven \(svar\). Especially interesting is his
folk-etymological linking of the word svarita with svar ‘heaven,’ and the
upward movement of the head of the reciter. This also corresponds to the
orthographic vertical mark to indicate a svarita. While the western scholars
have focused upon the ‘falling’ character of svarita, the Indian tradition may
have looked at the initial high tone as the distinguishing mark of a svarita.
Several texts say that the initial portion of a svarita is not just a high tone
\(udātta\), but that it is a super-high tone \(udāttatara\), cf. RPR \(3.45\) and
Vaidikābharaṇa on TPR \(1.41\). In Vedic recitation, when an udātta is
followed by a svarita, the tone rises from high to super-high, before falling.
For gestures accompanying the different pitches used by different tradition,
see: Allen \(1953: 91\).
The reading of the second verse from the Māṇḍūkīśikṣā quoted in the
commentary of Bhārgava-Bhāskara is slightly different from the one seen in
the Śikṣāsaṃgraha edition \(p. 470\):

the beginning of a svarita is udātta. It is also certain that the CA rule is identi-

tion of this rule does not seem to be correct. For him, irrespective of the
number of mātrās in a svarita vowel, fully the first half portion is udātta. If
such were the intention, the CA rule might as well be framed with the expres-

sion ardham alone, and not mātrārdham. However, we may note that
Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s interpretation is in agreement with late Pāṇinian com-

It is not always clear whether or not to include nāsikā ‘nose’ as part of mukha.
While CA \(1.1.26: नासिक्यानां नासिका\) lists nāsikā as an articulator for the pure
nasal nāsikya sounds under the general heading of our present rule, CA
\(1.1.27: अनुनासिकानां मुखनासिकम्\) mentions oral and nasal tracts separately and
says that both of these are used for the articulation of nasalized sounds
\(anunāsika\).

Note: Bhārgava-Bhāskara seems to have confused the notion of
prayatna as it appears in the Pāṇinian school with that of karaṇa in this text.
The first term refers to the manner in which the articulator \(karaṇa\) relates to
the point of articulation \(sthāna\). On the other hand, the second term refers to
the articulator. Historically speaking, the term prayatna originally did not even
have this meaning. Its meaning, most probably, was simply “effort.” This is
the meaning seen even in Pāṇini’s rules like P.8.3.18 \(व्योर्लघुप्रयत्नतरः शाकटा-
यनस्य\). Here, the term laghu-prayatna-tara does not refer to the manner in

126अध्याय १, पाद १
which the articulator relates to the point of articulation, but to the general
articulatory effort. In this case, it refers to a weak articulatory effort. Most
probably, the term prayatna had the same generic meaning in P.1.1.9
\(तुल्यास्यप्रयत्नं सवर्णम्\), but that it was explained by the commentators by using
more refined categories which were developed in later times. It seems that
words like spr̥ṣṭa ‘touching, in contact’  were originally used as adjectives of
the word karaṇa ‘articulator’ to distinguish the different positions of the
articulator. This is seen in the CA and in the RPR \(13.8ff: तद्विशेषः करणं
स्पृष्टमस्थितं ...\) These differences of the position of the karaṇa later came to be
denoted by the term prayatna. The VPR \(1.43: समानस्थानकरणास्यप्रयत्नः सवर्णः\) is
probably the earliest text which came to clearly distinguish between the terms
karaṇa ‘articulator’ and āsyaprayatna ‘effort,’ see: Deshpande \(1975: 9-11, 94-
97\). The CA clearly first describes the articulators for different sounds, and
then it describes the positions of those articulators. However, it does not use
the term prayatna to refer to these different positions of the articulators
\(karaṇa\).

Whitney \(1.19\), G: °कण्ठः. A, B, L, M: °मधरं कंण्ठ्यः. G: 1.1.19.
Except G, all mss. support the reading कण्ठ्यः. While the reading adhara-
kaṇṭhyaḥ is clearly justified on the basis of the manuscript evidence, one
wonders if adharakaṇṭhaḥ was the original reading. The oldest commentary
CAB knows the reading adharakaṇṭhaḥ. It is possible that -kaṇṭhyaḥ was an
ancient error which was copied blindly by most manuscript traditions.
Translation: For the glottal sounds, the lower part of the
glottal area \[is the articulator\].
Note: Allen \(1953: 59\) prefers to render kaṇṭhya with ‘glottal.’
However, it is not clear what is exactly meant by the distinction of lower glottal
area versus upper glottal area. Whitney renders kaṇṭha with throat. However,
the same word kaṇṭha is used to describe the production of resonance and
voiceless breath, depending upon whether kaṇṭha is open or closed. Such a
description better fits the glottis, rather than throat in a broad sense. Now what
could adharakaṇṭh\(y\)a refer to, in contrast with the rest of the kaṇṭha ? If we
take kaṇṭha to refer just to the glottis, then it is difficult to make the distinction
of lower versus upper glottis. However, it is possible that the word kaṇṭha
referred to the entire throat area inclusive of the glottis. The upper part of this
kaṇṭha was involved in the production of velar sounds, while the lower part,

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका127
i.e. the glottis, was involved in the production of the vowel a etc. Since, the
only moving part of this kaṇṭha in the sense of the whole throat area was the
glottis, the text could refer to it to be the articulator for the vowel a etc. These
difficulties of accurate classification probably explain why some texts opted to
describe the k-series as a kaṇṭhya series, while others chose to describe it as a
velar series with a distinct point of articulation, i.e. the root of the tongue. In a
view that a and k were both kaṇṭhya sounds, one could not truly say that they
had the same karaṇa. Such a reasoning may have led the ancient phoneticians
to differentiate these two by positing different points of articulations for them.
In any case, the description of the process of articulation of these glottal
sounds as given in the CAB is very dubious: “the upper kaṇṭha is the place of
articulation and it is approached by the lower kaṇṭha.” This reference to lower
kaṇṭha as the articulator, in spite of its understandable parallelism with the
notion of the lower lip as the articulator for labials in CA \(1.1.25\), hardly
makes sense. Perhaps, such absurdities may have led other texts to declare that
glottal sounds do not have a distinct karaṇa of their own. For them, the point
of articulation and the articulator are the same, cf. शेषाः स्वस्थानकरणाः, Āpiśali-
śikṣā \(2.9, p. 3, Yudhishthira Mimamsaka edition\).
Allen \(1953: 59\) has an enlightening discussion on the classification of
a, h, and -ḥ as kaṇṭhya ‘glottal’ sounds: “To class the open vowels as ‘glottal’
appears at first sight an indefensible procedure. It becomes less so when we
perceive the conceptual framework underlying these statements. It will be
remembered that the TP referred to a ‘neutral’ position of the articulatory
organs, in which the tongue is extended and depressed, and the lips are in the
position for a. The classification of a as glottal begins to make sense if we
assume that it was viewed as a ‘neutral’ vowel in the sense of involving no
special intra-buccal articulatory effort.” Where the difference of opinion arises
is the question of karaṇa for these ‘glottal’ sounds. The CA is perhaps making
a unique effort to find a karaṇa for these sounds, for which, according to other
traditions, there is no distinct karaṇa \(Allen 1953: 49, 59\).

Allen \(1953: 17\) points out the similarity of the definitions of sthāna
and karaṇa given by the CAB to Kenneth Pike’s terms ‘point of articulation’
and ‘articulator.’ Also compare TPR \(2.31-34\): स्वराणां यत्रोपसंहारस्तत्स्थानम् ।
यदुपसंहरति तत्करणम् । अन्येषां तु यत्र स्पर्शनं तत्स्थानम् । येन स्पर्शयति तत्करणम् ।
The CA does not give us a list of which sounds it considers to be
kaṇṭhya. That task has fallen to the commentators. The CAB and the ancient
Śikṣā text it cites agree that the label of kaṇṭhya ‘glottal’ be given to a, ā, ā3, h,
and ḥ. Then comes the difference. While the cited Śikṣā verse says that the
initial elements of the diphthongs ai, and au are also glottal, the CAB goes one
step ahead and adds e and o, implying that these sounds are not mono-
phthongs, and that their initial elements are also glottal. In doing so, it agrees
with the statements found in Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary on CA \(1.1.
28\).

Note: While the CAB appropriately maintains the distinction between
the point of articulation \(sthāna\) and the articulator \(karaṇa\), Bhārgava-
Bhāskara has confused the two notions. The rule, taken in its proper context,
says that the lower kaṇṭha is the articulator of those sounds which have kaṇṭha

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका129
as their point of articulation. Bhārgava-Bhāskara interprets the rule to mean:
“The point of articulation for these sounds is the lower kaṇṭha.” This is not
correct. This confusion is continued in many of the following rules.
On this particular rule, Bhārgava-Bhāskara does seem to maintain a
certain distinction of the CA tradition from that represented by the texts such as
the Āpiśaliśikṣā \(1.2\) and the prose Pāṇinīyaśikṣā \(1.2\) which treat the k-
series as kaṇṭhya, in addition to a, h, and ḥ.  The Āpiśaliśikṣā \(1.2\) and the
prose Pāṇinīyaśikṣā \(1.2\) say: अकुहविसर्जनीयाः कण्ठ्याः, cf. SK on P.1.1.9: अकु-
हविसर्जनीयानां कण्ठः.  These texts express a view different from that of the metri-
cal Pāṇinīyaśikṣā, which ascribes kaṇṭha as the point of articulation for a and h,
while it ascribes jihvāmūla to the k-series, cf. verses 17-18: कण्ठ्यावहौ, ...

supports Whitney. A comparison of the way ऌ and लॄ are written in the
manuscript N in the commentary on CA 1.1.32 leaves no doubt that the se-
quence here refers to these two sounds. It may also be noted that the transmis-
sion of the CAB and that of the Varṇapaṭala may have occurred independently.
The reading ऌवर्णस्येति स स्मृतः is not found among the variants in the

Note: Again, the commentators differ as to which sounds are to be
listed as velar sounds. The CAB and the Śikṣā it cites list the k-series of stops,
the r̥ and l̥ vowels, and the allophone of ḥ before k, kh, i.e. ḫ \(jihvāmūlīya\).
For a detailed review of the velar classification for r̥ and l̥ vowels, see Hans
Henrich Hock \(1992\). Following the late Pāṇinian tradition, Bhārgava-
Bhāskara removes the r̥- and l̥-vowels from the list of velars. For him, the r̥-
vowels are retroflex, while the l̥-vowels are dental. See Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s
commentary on CA 1.1.22, 24.
The confusion of the notions of sthāna and karaṇa continues into this
rule in Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary. This is explainable in part because
he identifies the referents of the words jihvāmūla and hanumūla. If these two
words refer to the same thing, then how can the point of articulation be differ-
ent from the articulator? It needs to be pointed out that these terms do not refer
to the same thing. 
Another point to consider is that Bhārgava-Bhāskara does not include
the sounds r̥ and l̥ among the jihvāmūlīyas.  For him, r̥ is a mūrdhanya sound,
while l̥ is a dantya sound. This is more in line with later texts in the Pāṇinian
tradition like the Siddhāntakaumudī. The CAB, on the other hand, seems to
reflect an older view.
The final comment of Bhārgava-Bhāskara that the word jihvāmūlīya is
derived by adding the affix cha \(\! īya\) to the word jihvāmūla shows how he
takes the Pāṇinian system for granted both for himself, and for his readers.
In the phonetic literature, there is indeed a good deal of confusion in the
case of sounds such as these concerning which of the organs is the point of
articulation and which is the articulator. While the CA rule literally seems to
say that the hanumūla is the articulator and that the jihvāmūla is the point of
articulation, the TPR \(ii. 35: हनुमूले जिह्वामूलेन कवर्गे स्पर्शयति\) presents a reverse
doctrine. While the CAB seems to offer a straight forward interpretation of the
CA statement, Bhārgava-Bhāskara seems to have been influenced by other tra-
ditions. Thus, the Āpiśaliśikṣā \(2.4: जिह्वामूलेन जिह्व्यानाम्\) states that the jihvā-

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका131
mūla is the articulator for jihvya sounds. The same doctrine is found in the
prose Pāṇinīyaśikṣā \(2.3\). 
१.१.२१. तालव्यानां मध्यजिह्वम् ।
Whitney \(1.21\). G: 1.1.21. Most mss. read jivham.
Translation: For palatal sounds, the middle of the tongue \[is
the articulator\].
Note: Again, the CA itself does not tell us which sounds are included
in the category of palatal sounds. For that we have to rely upon the
commentators who differ from each other on this point.
चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - तालुस्थानानां वर्णानां मध्यजिह्वं करणं

‘ताल्वे\(Whitney: ल्वै\)यशचवर्गाणामिवर्णस्य च
भाष्यते ।’ \(= वर्णपटलम्, २१\)
Note: The verse cited by the CAB seems to hold a slightly different
view as compared to that of the commentary. The commentary, if correctly
reproduced by the manuscripts, seems to include both e and ai among the
sounds produced at the palate, besides the i-vowels and the c-series. On the
other hand, out of e and ai, the verse seems to include only the sound e. This
may be a reflection of the old view that e was a pure monophthongal tālavya
sound, while ai, atrue diphthong, was a composite sound with distinct
points of articulation for its two parts, kaṇṭha for the first part and tālu for the
second part. The emendation suggested by Whitney does not seem to lead to
an acceptable text. It is hard to see how ai could be included without the
inclusion of e. On the other hand, it is easy to see how e could be included
without the inclusion of ai. Bolling and Negelein \(1910: 302\) report that the
mss. A and E of the Varṇapaṭala support the reading \*tālvai-, while the rest of
the mss. support the reading tālve-.
Allen \(1953: 52\) also makes an important point: “No difficulty is
provided by the description of the c-series, which at the period described by
out treatises appear still to have been true palatal plosives rather than pre-palatal
affricates such as are general in modern Indian pronunciation.” The modern
pronunciation neither uses the middle of the tongue, nor the point of articula-

132अध्याय १, पाद १
tion named as tālu. This tālu as intended by the Sanskrit phoneticians must
have been farther back on the oral dome as compared to the point touched
during the pronunciation of the retroflex stops. This must be so given the
back-to-front ordering of the consonantal vargas. However, the modern pro-
nunciation uses a point slightly above the alveolar ridge and pressed against it
not the middle of the tongue, but a portion of the tongue much closer to the tip
of the tongue. The historical alternations between palatal and velar consonants
are also an indication that the palatal point of articulation was much farther back
and closer to the velar point, than being closer to the alveolar ridge as it is in the
modern pronunciation.

Note: Bhārgava-Bhāskara includes neither e nor ai among the pure
tālavya sounds. This is similar to his exclusion of o and au from the list of the
pure oṣṭhya sounds later on. The reason is that he treats these four sounds, in
line with the late Pāṇinian tradition, to be sounds with double points of ar-
ticulation, kaṇṭhatālu and kaṇṭhauṣṭha respectively for e, ai, and o, au, cf.
Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary on CA1.1.28. This brings out a significant
difference between the CAB and the commentary by Bhārgava-Bhāskara. The
former is most certainly a relatively earlier text and is relatively free from the
influence of the Pāṇinian tradition. It seems that, as time went on, the com-
mentaries were influenced more and more by the Pāṇinian school. This is at-
tributable to the fact that while the Pāṇinian school flourished, the Prātiśākhya
tradition became more and more dormant, and the late efforts seen in the
commentaries like those of Bhārgava-Bhāskara were essentially efforts to in-
terprete these texts in familiar Pāṇinian terms.

\(= वर्णपटलम्, २१. \*तथा मतः\)
Note: While the cited verse makes no reference to r or r̥, the enumera-
tion in the commentary includes r, which is described elsewhere in the CA \(1.
1.28\) as being alveolar and not cerebral. The inclusion of r among the mūr-
dhanyas is relatively late. Thus, the cited verse seems to represent an earlier
phase in the development of Sanskrit phonetics. Neither the cited verse nor the
commentary makes a reference to r̥, because that sound is considered to be a
jihvāmūlīya by this text. On the other hand, Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary
below includes r̥ among the mūrdhanyas. This is again a reflection of his
following the late Pāṇinian tradition. Interestingly, he excludes r from the list
of mūrdhanyas. 
Allen \(1953: 32\) discusses the Indian description of retroflexion and
comments that “to consider the retroflex articulations on the same terms as the
velars, palatals, dentals, or labials is, even from the point of view of the Indian
descriptive framework, not entirely justified.” He feels \(ibid, p. 33\) that “the
retroflex series ... is articulated as our treatises recognize, ‘by rolling back the
tip of the tongue’ - that is to say, the place of articulation is not automatically
determined by the application of the closure-processes to the apical articulator:
there is need of a further prayatna, ‘articulatory effort,’ which might with con-
sistency have been included at this point.” I feel that the curling back of the
tongue has not been treated as a prayatna, firstly because the notion of prayatna
is defined somewhat narrowly as referring to degrees of contact or lack of it,
between the articulator and the place of articulation. Furthermore, given the
same point of articulation and the articulator, one does not have a choice of
whether or not to curl up one’s tongue. Thus, curling up one’s tongue is not a
feature of choice, with other factors being constant. It is just sheer necessity.

Whitney \(1.23\). G: 1.1.23.
Translation: For the sound ṣ, the bowl-\[shaped tongue is the
articulator\].
Note: Whitney feels that ṣ should not have been singled out for a
special treatment among the cerebral sounds, and that this rule may have been
“very possibly a later interpolation in the text of our treatise. ... It can hardly be
claimed that this rule adds to the distinctness of our apprehension of the char-
acter of this sibilant, which is clearly enough exhibited by its relation to the
other lingual sound.” In any case, the rule is found in all manuscripts, and
there is no reason to consider it to be an interpolation, cf. TPR \(2.45\): करणमध्यं
तु विवृतम्. In contrast to Whitney, Allen \(1953: 26\) admiringly calls this: “a
rather more graphic description,” and cites a similar description by Grammont.
The commentary of Bhārgava-Bhāskara also adds some graphic description of
its own. While for the other cerebral sounds, it is the rolled back tip of the
tongue which becomes the articulator, the pronunciation of ṣ was supposed to
be done in such a way that the middle of the tongue had a dip, and the lower
sides of the front edges of the tongue touched the sides of the palatal region.
The Āpiśaliśikṣā says that all cerebral sounds are produced with “the part next
to the tip, or the under-side of the tip,” Allen \(1953: 53\). It is possible that the
CA made a distinction between the rest of the cerebral sounds and the ṣ. The
CA distinction is at least internally well supported, because it says that the
middle of the articulator remains open, i.e. without contact. Thus, the tongue
turned into a bowl-like shape, the sides of the front of the touched the sides of
the curvature of the oral cavity, leaving the middle without contact. In contrast
with this, the tip of the tongue had a direct contact in the pronunciation of cere-
bral stops.

Note: Whitney translates prastīrṇa as ‘thrust forward,’ and this might
imply that the tip of the tongue was pressed against the upper teeth. The com-
mentary of Bhārgava-Bhāskara, on the other hand, lends support to Allen’s
\(1953: 56\) rendering of prastīrṇa as ‘spread, flat.’ The commentary describes
the tongue as spread out flat like the leaf of a Vaṭa ‘banyan’ tree.

136अध्याय १, पाद १
Note: In contrast with the CAB and the verse cited therein, the late
tradition recorded in Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary treats l̥ to be a dantya
sound. It is clear that Bhārgava-Bhāskara follows here the late Pāṇinian
school. At the same time, Bhārgava-Bhāskara seems to give an explanation of
the articulation of dentals which makes them more like dantamūlīya. Accord-
ing to him the tip of the tongue touches the root of the teeth \(जिह्वाग्रं दन्तमूलस्पर्शि
भवति\). If the blade of the tongue is truly flat, we would expect a true dental,
rather than an alveolar pronunciation. It is not clear whether Bhārgava-
Bhāskara intends the normal pronunciation of dentals to be more like the
alveolars, or just that a clear enunciation \(sphuṭa-uccāra\) of the dentals was
more like alveolars. One possible interpretation of these comments is that even
though the CA calls these sounds dentals, they were pronounced like alveolars
in Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s own tradition. The RPR \(1.9\) also supports the
alveolar pronunciation for the sounds which are normally considered to be
dentals. It is of some interest to note that Bhārgava-Bhāskara generally follows
the tradition of the Pāṇinīyaśikṣā, and that there is no support for the alveolar
pronunciation of dentals in that text. Thus, the source of this deviation remains

Note: Notice that the cited verse includes v among the labials, while it
is not included in the prose listing, perhaps because it is considered to be a
labiodental \(dantyoṣṭhya\) sound. Here again, the cited verse represents an ear-
lier tradition of classification, while the commentary represents a later tradition.
There are two slightly different possibilities for v being classified earlier as an
oṣṭhya sound. One possibility is that it was a true glide, more like the English
w. The other possibility is that many texts considered teeth to be the articulator
for v, but not its point of articulation, and hence in spite of its labio-dentality, it
came to be listed as an oṣṭhya sound. The second possibility has greater textual
justification in other phonetic treatises. For further details, see: Allen \(1953:
57\). 
Another important factor to note is that many Śikṣā texts do not distin-
guish between the point or articulation and the articulator for labial sounds,
while here the CA seems to make a determined effort to come up with an ar-
ticulator for each sound. Compare also CA \(1.1.19: कण्ठ्यानामधरकण्ठ्यः\). 
Also compare: Varṇapaṭala 22bcd:

Note: Here Bhārgava-Bhāskara lists v among the oṣṭhya sounds.
However, he explains that v is an exception to other oṣṭhya sounds in that its
articulator is ūrdhvadantāgra “tips of the upper teeth.” For his authority, he
refers to the dantauṣṭhya “labio-dental” classification for v in the Pāṇinian tra-
dition. The Pāṇinīya tradition, however, does not clearly distinguish between
the sthāna and karaṇa for v. It is curious to note that the text of CA does not
have a separate statement, like some other phonetic treatises, concerning the
separate karaṇa for v. This makes us wonder if the original text did conceive

138अध्याय १, पाद १
of v as a dantauṣṭya sound. If v did not have a separate karaṇa of its own,
apart from that of the other oṣṭhya sounds, and if it was more like the other
oṣṭhya sounds, then it must have been a bilabial sound, like the English w.
This may, perhaps, explain why the gap between v and b seemed much smaller
within the Atharvaveda tradition, and a separate treatise listing the words with
these two sounds, i.e. the text called Dantyoṣṭhyavidhi, had to be developed
within this tradition. Among modern Indian languages, the merger of v with b
is seen more frequently in Bengali and the related eastern languages, and occa-
sionally in the Hindi-speaking area, cf. Hindi bīs ‘twenty’. The close connec-
tion of the Atharvaveda itself with the tradition of Vrātyas and the region of
Magadha makes such an articulation of v a very old possibility. This may also
hint at the eastern origin of the tradition of CA itself, along with that of the
Dantyoṣṭhyavidhi, though no manuscripts of the CA have been found in these
eastern parts. 
१.१.२६. नासिक्यानां नासिका ।
Whitney \(1.26\). G: 1.1.26.
Translation: For the sounds with the nose as their point of
articulation, the nose \[is also the articulator\].
Note: Most Sanskrit texts do not distinguish between the point of ar-
ticulation and the articulator for the nasal sounds. However, as seen in CA
\(1.1.19\) and \(1.1.25\), the CA makes a unique effort to distinguish between the
point of articulation and the articulator for each sound, even though, as in the
present case, they turn out to be the same. Also, it is not immediately clear
what the reference of the term nāsikya is, as distinct from that of the term
anunāsika in the next rule. The commentaries include under the term nāsikya
sounds which are generally recognized as anunāsika, e.g. ṅ, ñ, ṇ, n, and m.
Whitney suggests that the rule should properly apply to “merely the nāsikya
and the yamas.” Here, the term nāsikya refers to a peculiar nasal sound, which
is inserted between an h and the following n, ṇ, or m, and is equivalent to a
nasalized h̐ cf. CA \(1.4.9: हकारान्नासिक्येन\), also see: Allen \(1953: 77\). How-
ever, the tradition conceives it to be a pure nasal sound, rather than as a nasal-
ized h. However, what about the yamas? If the yama corresponding to k is a
nasalized k̐, then how is it possible to say that this sound is a pure nasal
sound. For instance, the Nāradīśikṣā \(Śikṣāsaṃgraha, p. 428; Allen, 1953:
76\) says that the yama which comes between a non-nasal stop and a nasal is a

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका139
nasal sound homorganic with the preceding stop. Thus, it does not make sense
to call it a pure nasal.

Note: The Varṇapaṭala reads iṣyate for ucyate. Also note that the
notation kaṃ-khaṃ-gaṃ-ghaṃ in the commentary refers to the so-called
yamas, or the nasalized ‘twins,’ i.e. nasalized transitional segments which come
after non-nasal stops, before nasals, cf. CA \(1.4.8\): समानपदेऽनुत्तमात् स्पर्शादुत्तमे
यमैर्यथासंख्यम्. Also compare the doctrine of the TPR \(21.12\): स्पर्शाद-
नुत्तमादुत्तमपरादानुपूर्व्यान्नासिक्याः. The TPR actually uses the term nāsikya to refer
to these sounds, instead of using the term yama. This doctrine of yama as an
additional transitional segment is different from the doctrine found in the RPR
\(6. verse 8\): स्पर्शा यमाननुनासिकाः स्वान् परेषु स्पर्शेष्वनुनासिकेषु, which teaches that
non-nasal stops, before nasal stops, are replaced by the corresponding yamas.
In this procedure, the yamas may be said to be nasalized allophones for non-
nasal stops, before nasals. I thank George Cardona for bringing this reference
to my attention.

Note: Bhārgava-Bhāskara omits the yamas from the list of nasal
sounds, and this may also be a reflection of his reliance on the late Pāṇinian
school, where the yamas are not given a proper place. The yamas are included

140अध्याय १, पाद १
neither in the Śivasūtras, nor referred to in the rules of Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī.
Thus, one can conclude that using the Pāṇinian tradition for the elucidation of a
Prātiśākhya text is on the whole a regressive development, and this is what we
see in the commentary of Bhārgava-Bhāskara. The confusion of the notion of
nāsikya and anunāsika continues in Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary.
१.१.२७. अनुनासिकानां मुखनासिकम् ।
Whitney \(1.27\). G: 1.1.27. P reads मुखनासिका.
Translation: For the nasalized sounds, the oral \[organ, as
well as,\] the nose \[are the articulators\].
Note: Like several previous rules, e.g. CA \(1.1.19, 25-26\), this rule
makes a vain effort to distinguish between the articulator and the point of arti-
culation for nasalized sounds, and ends up identifying the same organs as both
the point of articulation and the articulator. Here, there is also an additional
problem, which neither the CA nor the commentators address clearly. What is
the distinction between the nāsikya sounds and the anunāsika sounds? The
commentators are clearly confused over this issue.

\(= वर्णपटलम्, १२\)
Note: Interestingly, the only sound included by the CAB under the
category of anunāsika is the anusvāra. It leaves out the nasal vowels and con-
sonants which are generally referred to by this term in the Sanskrit phonetic
texts.
Strangely, the CAB uses the word anunāsikasthāna as if the word anu-
nāsika referred to a point of articulation. There is no such sthāna-expression in

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका141
Sanskrit, and the Caturādhyāyībhāṣya is simply giving a paraphrase of the ex-
pression anunāsika, which is comparable to its paraphrases of expressions in
earlier rules, cf. oṣṭhya = oṣṭhasthāna, dantya = dantasthāna, nāsikya = nāsikā-
sthāna. 
In this case, majority of the mss. for the Varṇapaṭala \(= ABCETU\)
give the reading mukhanāsikena. This is rejected by Bolling and Negelein in
favor of the minority reading mukhanāsike ye varṇā. With the concurrence of
reading from the mss. of the CAB, the reading mukhanāsikena gains in
probability.
Whether nāsikā is a sthāna or karaṇa for the anunāsika sounds is not
quite clear from the statement of the rule, and the commentary does not help
either. The expression mukhanāsika seems to refer to a joint mode of articula-
tion, without making a further distinction between sthāna and karaṇa. At the
same time, it is to be acknowledged that the term is a popular one. It is seen in
the cited Śikṣā text, and is also used by Pāṇini in his rule P. 1.1.8 \(मुखनासिका-
वचनोऽनुनासिकः\). For a number of sounds, the Apiśaliśikṣā \(2.9: शेषाः स्वस्थान-
करणाः\) openly declares that the sthāna and the karaṇa is the same organ.
Among these are the kaṇṭhya, oṣṭhya, nāsikya, and anunāsika sounds.
The Pāṇinian commentators do make a distinction in the status of
nāsikā in relation to different sounds. For details, see: Deshpande \(1975: 11\),
Bare \(1980: 138\). The verse cited in the commentary is also important in that it
is the only other ancient text, besides Pāṇini 1.1.9 \(तुल्यास्यप्रयत्नं सवर्णम्\) and the
VPR 1.43 \(समानस्थानकरणास्यप्रयत्नः सवर्णः\), to use the term āsyaprayatna in
relation to a definition of the term savarṇa, see: Deshpande \(1975: 92\). Verses
13-15 of the Varṇapaṭala are related to savarṇa and savarṇagrahaṇa:

Note: Bhārgava-Bhāskara says that nasal e and ai have kaṇṭhatālu-
nāsikam as their points of articulation, implying that the non-nasal ones have
kaṇṭhatālu as their points of articulation. The inclusion of e, and similarly the
inclusion of o, among sounds with double points of articulation is a relatively
late phenomenon seen mostly in texts which follow the Pāṇinīyaśikṣā.
Bhārgava-Bhāskara on the next rule actually quotes the versified Pāṇinīyaśikṣā
to this effect. It is not clear why Bhārgava-Bhāskara does not list the nasal
stops under the category of anunāsika. His description of these sounds given
in the commentary under the previous rule exactly matches the description of
anunāsika sounds given here.
१.१.२८. रेफस्य दन्तमूलानि ।
Whitney \(1.28\). G: 1.1.28.
Translation: For r, the roots of the teeth \(i.e. alveolar ridge\)
\[is the articulator\].
Note: This rule indicates that the text of the CA itself is confused
over the notions of the point of articulation \(sthāna\) and the articulator \(karaṇa\).
Generally, the articulator is the moving organ and the point of articulation is the
relatively stationary part in the oral tract. Here, one would naturally expect a
portion of the tongue, such as the tip of the tongue, to be the articulator, while
the alveolar ridge or the roots of the teeth would be the point of articulation.
The Śikṣā verse cited by the CAB correctly describes dantamūla as a point of

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका143
articulation \(sthāna\). On the other hand, the CAB itself is philologically accu-
rate in interpreting the CA rule to mean that dantamūla is an articulator \(ka-
raṇa\).

Note: Even the words अपर आह are found in the Varṇapaṭala. This
may be an indication that the Varṇapaṭala is itself a conflation of earlier texts.
The Varṇapaṭala reads हनुमूले तु रेफः स्यात् for हनुमूले तु रेफस्य.
The example पुना रक्तं वासः cited by the CAB is not found in the Vulgate
of the AV, nor in any other Saṃhitā, Brāhmaṇa, Āraṇyaka, or Upaniṣad.
Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 40\) suggests that this may have occurred
in the genuine Śaunakīya recension of the AV, and that the Vulgate is not the
genuine Śaunakīya recension. However, his example is cited in the KV on P.

Note: The rule to says that dantamūla is the karaṇa for r. On the
other hand, Bhārgava-Bhāskara disregards the context of karaṇa for this rule,
and treats dantamūla not only as a sthāna, but as an indication of the vicinity of
the real sthāna for this sound, namely mūrdhan. Treating r as a mūrdhanya,
when the rule clearly says that it is dantamūlīya, shows how the characteri-
zations in the Pāṇinīyaśikṣā override the explicit statements of the CA. The
Śikṣā cited in the CAB reports that there are different views regarding the point
of articulation for r and that mūrdhanya and dantamūlīya are some of the
alternative classifications for it. It does not try to interpret the term dantamūlīya
as a near synonym for mūrdhanya, and to this extent, it shows that it is not as
much influenced by the Pāṇinian school.
Allen \(1953: 54\) says that while the Pāṇinīyaśikṣā describes r as being
a retroflex sound, “the Prātiśākhyas generally require an alveolar articulation
\(which agrees with the present pronunciation of Sanskrit and the general prac-
tice of the modern Indo-Aryan languages\).” There are two points to be noted
here. The first point, as brought out by Allen \(1953: 53\), is that r \(as well as r̥\)
functions phonologically as a member of the retroflex class, in spite of the
probable dialectal variation in its phonetic value. I have suggested \(Deshpande,
1979: 284\) that it is this phonological retroflexion of r and r̥ which was eventu-
ally confused with phonetic retroflexion in later times, perhaps under the pres-
sure of facilitating grammatical procedures like substitutions being decided in
terms of maximal featural similarity between an original item and its substitute
\(cf. P.1.1.50: स्थानेऽन्तरतमः\). The second point to note is that the notion of
karaṇa receives only scant attention in the later Pāṇinian tradition, as compared
to the notion of sthāna. This is also because the maximum featural similarity
\(āntaratamya\) between substitutes and their originals is decided in terms of the
sthāna, but not the karaṇa. With a diminishing understanding of factors like
karaṇa, the later Pāṇinian tradition in fact becomes much less interested in the
true phonetic descriptions of the Sanskrit sounds, except as required to
facilitate the procedures of savarṇagrahaṇa and āntaratamya. 
The verse ‘एऐ तु कण्ठ्यतालव्यौ ...’ is also found in the Śaunakaśikṣā \(p.
15\).

Note: The Śikṣā verse cited by the CAB says that, in intervocalic
contexts, the sounds ḍ and ḍh are not to be pronounced as normal sparśa
sounds with full contact of the articulator and the point of articulation, but
should be pronounced without pressing the articulator against the point of arti-
culation, and that they should be pronounced with a light articulatory effort.
This description makes these sounds into flaps, similar to the intervocalic ḷ and
ḷh of the R̥gveda. This doctrine is not known to the CA itself, and may have
developed later on, perhaps under the influence of the RV tradition. It is also
not recorded by the commentary of Bhārgava-Bhāskara, and it is not known to
the late text, the Māṇḍūkīśikṣā. It is not clear if the presence of such a descrip-
tion of ḍ and ḍh points to a distinct source for the ancient Śikṣā cited by the
CAB.

Note: The commentary of Bhārgava-Bhāskara uses the term prayatna
to refer to different modes of contact between the articulator and the point of
articulation. This is the meaning of this term in the Pāṇinian school. On the
other hand, the term probably meant articulatory effort in a generic sense, and
this is the sense seen in the term mr̥duprayatna used in the verse cited in the
CAB. A similar meaning for the term prayatna must be seen in the term laghu-

146अध्याय १, पाद १
prayatnatara used by Pāṇini \(8.3.18: व्योर्लघुप्रयत्नतरः शाकटायनस्य\). It seems
likely that the term prayatna had the same generic meaning of articulatory effort
in the term āsyaprayatna used by both Pāṇini \(1.1.9: तुल्यास्यप्रयत्नं सवर्णम्\) and the
Śikṣā text quoted the CAB on CA 1.1.27.

Note: It is not clear whether the original term was anta-sthā or antaḥ-
sthā. The problem becomes more complicated because an underlying
antaḥ\+sthā can as well result in the surface form antasthā in certain dialects of
Sanskrit. As the Aitareya-Āraṇyaka \(3.2.1\) informs us, the earlier categories
recognized by its author’s tradition were only three, i.e. vowels \(svara\), stops
\(sparśa\), and spirants \(ūṣman\). This text informs us that the scholar Hrasva
Māṇḍūkeya proposed the addition of antaḥsthā, and that this new addition was
not acceptable to its author. One possible explanation of the term anta-sthā
might refer to this fact of this category being the last addition. The reading
antaḥ-sthā has been discussed at length by Allen \(1953: 29\): “The Sanskrit
term for the category of semivowels is anta\(ḥ\)sthā, lit. ‘standing between’. It is
tempting, and has tempted modern commentators, to interpret this term as
referring to the postulated ‘intermediate’ degree of contact discussed above, or,
like our term ‘semi-vowel’, to their phonological alternation. The ending -sthā,
‘standing’, however, is more readily applicable to the place which these letters

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका147
occupy in the alphabet, viz. between the stops and the fricatives; and it is
doubtful whether the ancient sources provide evidence for any other inter-
pretation.” Of course, Allen does not consider the reading anta-sthā, which is
uniformly used by all the manuscripts of the CA. It is, however, clear that the
commentary of Bhārgava-Bhāskara explains this word as if it were antaḥ-sthā. 
Allen \(1953: 27-28\) further discusses the question of whether a sepa-
rate prayatna for semi-vowels, apart from that of the vowels is justified. Appa-
rently, it seems at first glance like a failure of the Indian phoneticians that they
do not see the distinction between vowels and semi-vowels as being phono-
logical, than phonetic. However, Allen appropriately refers to palatographic
studies of Indian languages which justify the claim of the Indian phoneticians
that the semi-vowels involve a slight degree of contact between the articulator
and the point of articulation, as compared to that of the vowels. Also, one
should remember that the Indian phoneticians were aware of the various
degrees of contact involved in the pronunciation of sounds like y and v,
depending upon whether they occurred word-initially or medially. Thus, the
use of expressions like ati-saṃspr̥ṣṭa-prayatna, laghu-prayatna-tara, and mr̥du-
prayatna should be sufficient to indicate the fineness of their observations.
Many of these are justified by the palatographic evidence, as well as by what
happens to these sounds in Prākrit languages. One should also keep in mind
that the distinction between ‘phonological’ versus ‘phonetic’ is a particularly
Western distinction, and while there are echoes of this distinction in the con-
cerns of the Indian grammarians and phoneticians, one should not expect to see
it overtly implemented in their works.
The Māṇḍūkīśikṣā does not know the categories of īṣatspr̥ṣṭa and īṣad-
vivr̥ta. It says that the karaṇa for stops is spr̥ṣṭa, while for the semi-vowels, it
is the opposite, i.e. aspr̥ṣṭa, see: स्पर्शानां करणं स्पृष्टमन्तःस्थानामतोऽन्यथा \(verse 70,
Śikṣāsaṃgraha, p. 469\).
Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s explanation of the īṣatspr̥ṣṭa as ‘touching \(= oc-
curring in\) the word-final position lightly \(i.e. only as a result of certain exter-
nal sandhi operations\),’ is indeed far from what is intended by the text of the
CA.

Note: The interpretation of this rule given in the CAB concludes that
the articulator of the ūṣmans is both vivr̥ta and īṣatspr̥ṣṭa. Following this
commentary, Whitney says: “the organ is both in partial contact and open - a
rather awkward way of saying, apparently, that its position is neither very close
nor very open.” Whitney does not reject such an interpretation, and, with the
word ca in the rule, this is indeed one of the ways to render this rule. Allen
\(1953: 26\) notes that the notion that the spirants do involve some contact and
some openness is justifiable on the basis of texts like TPR \(ii.45\), as well as on
the basis of modern palatographic studies of Indian language. TPR \(ii.45\)
suggests that the spirants are produced at the same points of articulation as the
homorganic stops, but that in the case of the spirants, the middle of the articu-
lator remains in an open position \(करणमध्यं तु विवृतम्\).
On the other hand, if we remove the ca from this rule following some
of the mss. which do not have it, and if we follow Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s
reading of the rule and its interpretation, we can take this rule to mean that the
articulator remains in an open position in the pronunciation of spirants, and,
then, by the next rule, so also for vowels.  Such a reading is also justified in
view of a likely citation of this rule in the MB \(on P.1.1.10\). 
Then there is the possibility that only the word īṣat, and not īṣatspr̥ṣṭa,
continues into this rule from the previous rule by the force of ca. This would
give us īṣadvivr̥ta as the mode of articulation for spirants, which accords well
with some of the late texts in the Pāṇinian tradition, cf. Laghusiddhānta-

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका149
kaumudī, on P.1.1.9 \(ईषद्विवृतमूष्मणां, विवृतं स्वराणाम्\). Such an interpretation is
suggested by a likely quotation of this rule in the MB \(on P.1.1.10\), and
Patañjali’s interpretation of it. Patañjali says: विवृतमूष्मणामीषदित्येव अनुवर्तते. If
one accepts this interpretation, then one would have to say that, after this rule,
īṣat is discontinued, and only the word vivr̥ta continues into the next rule
describing vowels. This is what Patañjali has proposed. Such an interpretation
is also supported by the interpretive maxim: चानुकृष्टं नोत्तरत्र, cf. Paribhāṣendu-
śekhara, Paribhāṣā 78.
While the versified Pāṇinīyaśikṣā \(verse 21\) says that vowels and spi-
rants share the same open \(vivr̥ta\) articulatory effort \(स्वराणामूष्मणां चैव विवृतं
करणं स्मृतम्\), the prose version of the Pāṇinīyaśikṣā \(3.6-8\) reflects the unre-
solved situation as described above: ईषद्विवृतकरणा ऊष्माणः, विवृतकरणा वा, विवृत-
करणाः स्वराः. One may note with interest the fact that the Māṇḍūkīśikṣā, which
is clearly later than the CA, does not seem to know the distinction between
vivr̥ta and īṣadvivr̥ta. It ascribes vivr̥ta to both vowels and spirants \(विवृतं च
स्वरोष्मणाम्, verse 70, p. 469\). 
As Whitney himself notes, the TPR \(ii.44, 45\) and RPR \(xiii.3, r.11\)
holds that both spirants and vowels do not involve contact \(aspr̥ṣṭa\). Such also
must be Pāṇini’s own view, i.e. that the vowels and spirants had the same
mode of approximation of the articulator. Only with such an assumption can
one explain the formulation of P.1.1.10 \(नाज्झलौ\). It prohibits homogeneity
\(sāvarṇya\) between vowels and consonants. However, the only possibility for
vowels and consonants sharing the same point of articulation and oral effort is
for vowels and spirants.

Note: Whitney on this rule does not read the Avagraha either in the
rule or in the commentary and this has misled him into reading the text as एके
स्पृष्टम् and translating it as: “Some consider it as forming a contact.” He be-
lieved that the rule and the commentator are citing an opinion that “in the utter-
ance of the vowels the organs are in contact; others that they remain open.”
This interpretation led him to comment: “The former opinion is too obviously
and grossly incorrect, one would think, to be worth quoting.” Allen \(1953: 28\)
seems to take the reading given in Whitney’s edition seriously, and tries to find
other evidence from phonetic treatises which say that even vowels involve
some contact: “It is presumably to isolated statements such as these \(= TPR
ii.24, Vyāsaśikṣā 284\) that the AP \(= CA\) is referring when it gives as the
opinion of some sources that contact is involved in the vowels, an opinion
which Whitney impatiently dismisses as ‘... too obviously and grossly incor-
rect, one would think, to be worth quoting.’” 
In fact, the entire discussion by Whitney and Allen is now outdated,
and one must read the rule as eke\+aspr̥ṣṭam, and this is supported by several
manuscripts with a clear avagraha. This is also clear from both the
commentaries. The alternatives are the aspr̥ṣṭa ‘non-contact’ view, versus the

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका151
vivr̥ta ‘openness’ view, and this makes perfect sense. For details on this
division of opinion, see: Deshpande \(1976a\). The main advantage in choosing
the vivr̥ta classification over the aspr̥ṣṭa classification is that, while it is difficult
to think of gradations of aspr̥ṣṭa ‘non-contact,’ it is perfectly possible to think
of gradations of vivr̥ta ‘open.’ Such gradations are seen in the use of the terms
īṣadvivr̥ta ‘slightly open,’ vivr̥tatara ‘more open,’ and vivr̥tatama ‘most open.’
While the notion of īṣadvivr̥ta may have been merely alluded to in CA \(1.1.31\),
the next rule, i.e. CA \(1.1.34\), actually uses the term vivr̥tatama. It thus makes
sense to conclude that the vivr̥ta classification was the preferred way for the
CA, but it wishes to record the aspr̥ṣṭa alternative upheld by other traditions.

Note: While Bhārgava-Bhāskara is correct in saying that the term
īṣadvivr̥ta occurs in a number of texts on Sanskrit grammar and phonetics, he
is alone in suggesting that this term refers to the effort for vowels. Such an
interpretation cannot be correct. It is also clear that Bhārgava-Bhāskara does
not understand the meaning of the term aspr̥ṣṭa. It does not refer to the lips not
touching each other or the mouth not closing during the pronunciation of
vowels. It rather refers to the fact that the articulator does not touch the point
of articulation in the pronunciation of vowels, but only approximates it. The
TPR \(ii.31-34: स्वराणां यत्रोपसंहारस्तत्स्थानम्; यदुपसंहरति तत्करणम्; अन्येषां तु यत्र
स्पर्शनं तत्स्थानम्; येन स्पर्शयति तत्करणम्\) uses the term upasaṃhāra “approxi-
mation/approaching” for this phenomenon, in contrast with the notion of
contact \(sparśa\). The RPR \(13.11: स्वरानुस्वारोष्मणामस्पृष्टं स्थितम्\) uses the term
aspr̥ṣṭa, while the Pāṇinian tradition generally uses the term vivr̥ta.

Note: The text of this rule and the next rule raises some important
questions. The fact that the older commentary, the CAB, supports a version of
this rule which deals only with e and o, and not with ai and au, makes one
support the reading as given here as the older and the original reading. In
comparison with other vowels, the vowels e and o are said to be most open
\(vivr̥tatama\), and the next rule says that the effort for ā is even more open than
that. The vowels ai and au are excluded from this discussion, not necessarily
because they are less open, but because they are held to be dvivarṇa sounds,
i.e. combinations of two vowels each, and hence they are not separately dis-
cussed. This must be the original situation. 
Later on, as indicated by the later commentaries, these statements were
modified to reflect further gradations. Thus, the version of these rules found in
the late commentary of Bhārgava-Bhāskara says: e and o are more open, ai and
au are most open, and ā is even more open than that. This version is supported
by the Āpiśaliśikṣā, and the prose versions of the Pāṇinīyaśikṣā. The fact that
the CAB does not yet show the impact of these other Pāṇinian sources perhaps

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका153
indicates its relatively early age. The later commentaries are explicit Pāṇinian
interpretations of the CA.
One should note that Patañjali himself does not use the notion of vivr̥ta-
tama, though several Pāṇinian commentators ascribe it to him, cf. Bare \(1980:
87\), Deshpande \(1975: 35\). Patañjali differentiates e and o from ai and au in a
different way. For him, the components of e and o are thoroughly fused
\(praśliṣṭa\) with each other. On the other hand, ai and au are true composite
sounds \(samāhāravarṇau\), cf. एवमप्यवर्णस्य एङोश्च सवर्णसंज्ञा प्राप्नोति । प्रश्लि-
ष्टावर्णावेतौ । अवर्णस्य तर्ह्यैचोश्च सवर्णसंज्ञा प्राप्नोति । विवृततरावर्णावेतौ ।, MB \(MLBD
edn.\), Vol. I, Sec. I, p. 62; and that the components of ai and au, i.e. a, i, and u,
are vivr̥tatara ‘more open’, cf. यदत्रावर्णं विवृततरं तदन्यस्मादवर्णाद्ये अपीवर्णोवर्णे
विवृततरे ते अन्याभ्यामिवर्णोवर्णाभ्याम्, MB \(ibid.\), p. 84. Also: इमावैचौ समाहारवर्णौ
मात्रावर्णस्य मात्रेवर्णोवर्णयोः, MB \(ibid\), p. 78.
This discussion offers an important insight into what probably hap-
pened to the Sanskrit phonetic traditions in later times. If indeed the sounds ai
and au are true diphthongs, or composed of two varṇas \(dvivarṇa\) as the
ancient Indian tradition calls them, then it makes no sense to ascribe vivr̥tatama
effort to these sounds, as their effort can only be the effort of the individual
components. The description vivr̥tatama seems to suggest a more unitary char-
acter to these sounds, which is not justifiable in terms of the ancient dvivarṇa
characterization, but makes sense if the pronunciation of these sounds was
something like what it is in modern standard Hindi. In modern standard Hindi,
a Sanskrit word like maithilī is pronounced with the first vowel being almost
equivalent to that in the English word ‘at.’ This may have been the phonetic
basis for saying that ai and au are vivr̥tatama sounds. Such early mono-
phthongization of ai and au, at least in certain dialects, may be suggested by the
fact that Sanskrit ai and au are reduced to e and o in Prakrits, cf. Sanskrit mai-
treya > Pāli metteya.
The other reason to distinguish between the efforts of e and ai, and o
and au, is that the later tradition considers these sounds to be kaṇṭhatālavya and
kaṇṭhauṣṭhya respectively. Without the differentiation between their efforts,
these sounds would become savarṇas with each other, and that would cause a
great deal of confusion. Thus, it is possible that such a phonological reasoning
may have led the later grammarians to distinguish between the efforts of these
sounds.
The importance of the original reading of this rule lies in that the older
phonetic texts consider e and o to be essentially monophthongal like i and u. In
that case, how would one distinguish i from e, and u from o? Such a necessity
seems to have led to the differentiation in the degree of openness found in this

154अध्याय १, पाद १
rule and the next. The fact that the CA talks only about e and o should be taken
as an indication of the monophthongal pronunciation for these vowels, and
their inclusion in the category of sandhyakṣara essentially shows how the
levels of phonetic and phonological considerations were blurred into each
other. The possibility of such further differentiation in the degree of openness
\(vivr̥ta\) makes this alternative more popular in later phonetic texts as compared
to the undifferentiated category of non-contact \(aspr̥ṣṭa\), which in all likelihood
is the earlier categorization. 
The lack of finer distinctions between the effort of vowels and sibilants
forced Pāṇini to construct an explicit rule prohibiting the impending homo-
geneity of vowels and consonants, i.e. P.1.1.10 \(नाज्झलौ\). If Pāṇini did not
differentiate between the degree of openness between vowels and sibilants, it
seems most unlikely that he differentiated between the degree of openness
between the various vowels. Problems created by such a lack of finer
differentiation must have led later grammarians and phoneticians to come up
with finer distinctions. Thus, the emergence of these finer distinctions in the
degree of openness are in all probability related to the emergence of careful
thought regarding problems in the application of homogeneity and sound-
substitution being decided in terms of featural proximity between the substitute
and the original. This shows the possibility that phonological considerations
may have led to further developments of phonetic classifications. Later com-
mentators in the Pāṇinian tradition itself have often advocated the position that
it better thing to accept a finer sub-classification of openness, and not
worry about keeping P.1.1.10 \(नाज्झलौ\), cf. Deshpande \(1975: 35, 170-171,
notes 121-122\).

Note: It is interesting to note that the text of the CA moves from
vivr̥ta to vivr̥tatama to ‘even more open than that.’ One would expect perhaps
the use of vivr̥tatara to describe the position for e and o, and vivr̥tatama to de-
scribe the position for ā. This felt gap in the terminology is made up by the
later version of the previous rule found in Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary:
e and o are vivr̥tatara ‘more open,’ ai and au are vivr̥tatama ‘most open,’ and ā
is even more open than that. As for Pāṇini, it seems that he probably did not
distinguish the degrees of openness, beyond assuming that the short a was a
saṃvr̥ta ‘close’ sound, in contrast with other vowels which were all open.

Whitney \(1.36\). G: 1.1.36. G and K show the Avagraha.
Translation: The sound a i\[relatively\] close\[r vowel, in

Note: Note the different syntax of this rule. In the previous rules,
words like vivr̥ta are neuter words, because they are used to modify the word
karaṇam, which continues throughout this section. However, here the word
saṃvr̥ta is used as a qualification of akāraḥ, and is, therefore, a masculine
word. One can also raise another interesting question. When we say that ā is a
most open sound, and that a is a closer sound, this openness or closeness, as a
feature of the karaṇa refers not to the openness or closeness of the glottal
aperture, but to the gap between the articulator and the point of articulation.
For the vowels a and ā, however, the point of articulation given is kaṇṭha, and
the articulator mentioned is the lower part of kaṇṭha. What sort of openness are
we talking about that distinguishes between a and ā? It cannot be the relative
openness of the glottal aperture. It must be the wider opening of the oral
cavity, i.e. wider opening of the mouth. This point has not been discussed
clearly by any Sanskrit text.

Note: The Pāṇinian tradition holds that the short a is a saṃvr̥ta sound,
while the long ā is a vivr̥ta sound. The CA classification is somewhat similar.
However, since the CA does not present a featural definition of the notion of
savarṇa, there is no dilemma within this text about how to have a and ā become
savarṇas of each other, in spite of their featural difference. Pāṇini was indeed
faced with such a dilemma, which he sought to resolve by artificially treating
\(or pronouncing?\) a as a vivr̥ta sound within the grammatical derivational
process, and reinstating the object language saṃvr̥ta a as the last step of all
derivations, cf. P.8.4.68 \(a a\). The Śikṣā text quoted by the CAB \(on CA
1.1.27\), i.e. समानास्यप्रयत्ना ये ते सवर्णा इति स्मृताः, defines the notion of savarṇa in
a way similar to that of Pāṇini 1.1.9 \(तुल्यास्यप्रयत्नं सवर्णम्\). However, we have
no information on how such a text would resolve the problem of homogeneity
between a and ā. One should also note the interesting explanation given by
Bhārgava-Bhāskara. He says that the vowel a is pronounced as an open
\(vivr̥ta\) sound in non-final positions, but that it is pronounced as a close
\(saṃvr̥ta\) sound when it occurs in the word-final position. While he describes
openness as wider opening of the mouth \(मुखं विवृतमुद्घाटितम्\), the only such
explantion known to me, his explanation of saṃvr̥ta is even more graphic:
“having turned the lower lip into the shape of a cup \(i.e. having rounded lower
lip?\), one should cover the lower teeth.” Such a description of a close a takes it
closer to the pronunciation of the Bengali a \(= ŏ\). It is very doubtful if the ex-

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका157
planation of saṃvr̥ta given by Bhārgava-Bhāskara is historically accurate as an
interpretation of the CA or of Pāṇini. However, it does seem to have been
based on some actual regional trait of pronunciation. This pronunciation of a
must be clearly differentiated from a truly neutral position of all organs advo-
cated for a by texts like TPR \(1.113\), cf. Allen \(1953: 59\).

Translation: \[The members of\] the r̥ class, \[i.e. r̥, r̥̄, and r̥̄3,
are\] fused with \[consonantal\] r.
Note: The above rule does not clearly define the nature of the fusion
of the constituent elements. According to the general description in Sanskrit
texts, in the constitution of a r̥ vowel, a consonantal r is flanked by two frac-
tional vowels, i.e. ∂r∂. The actual phonetic quality of the vocalic fractions was
probably determined by the consonants in the vicinity, though most Sanskrit
texts tend to look at these vocalic fractions as partial a vowels. Some Sanskrit
texts give more precise proportions of the vocalic and consonantal components
for r̥ vowels. Thus, for instance, the Sarvasammataśikṣā \(19\) says that a short
r̥ has four equal parts: There are two quarter-mora particles of the consonantal
r in the middle flanked by quarter-mora vowels, i.e. ∂rr∂, cf. Allen \(1953: 62\).
The Śikṣā verse cited by the Caturādhyāyībhāṣya seems to offer a close
parallel: a half mora quantity of the consonantal r, flanked by quarter-mora
vowels. Also see the Notes and the commentary on CA 1.4.10-11.

phonetic texts is further supported by the Avestan parallels such as p∂r∂∀u and
k∂r∂p for Sanskrit pr̥thu and kl̥p-, cf. Wackernagel-Debrunner \(1896-1954,
Vol.I., p. 32\).

Note: The example śaṃsaty r̥bhum is not found in any Vedic text.
The same is the case of the example yady r̥ṇam. Bhārgava-Bhāskara presents
some interesting arguments why the r element in the vocalic r̥ must be situated
between two vocalic fractions. He quotes an alternative view held by others
that the r is situated in the beginning, followed by a vocalic fraction. Bhārgava-
Bhāskara rejects such a view. It is interesting to note that such a view reflects
the latter-day pronunciation of this vowel either as ri or ru. Such pronuncia-

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका159
tions, if they were to be taken seriously, would lead to a lot of undesirable
phonological consequences. Thus, while the actual pronunciation of r̥ did in-
deed change, its phonological behavior remained like that of a vowel. While
the sandhi rules remained an inherited and fixed feature of Sanskrit, the actual
pronunciation of Sanskrit sounds was heavily influenced by the local factors.

Translation: For long and extra-long \[r̥ vowels, i.e. r̥̄ and
r̥̄3\], the first mora \[is fused with the consonantal r\].
Note: This rule seems to say that in lengthening the r̥ vowels, it is the
post-r vocalic fraction that is lengthened, and not the pre-r vocalic fraction. It
also makes clear that the lengthening applies only to the vowel portion, and not
to the consonantal portion.

Note: While the CAB on this rule is mostly uninformative, Bhārgava-
Bhāskara seems to offer a very strange interpretation. Whitney appropriately
interprets the rule to mean that only the first mora for r̥̄ and r̥̄3 is so combined

160अध्याय १, पाद १
with consonantal r. It is the subsequent vocalic element which undergoes
lengthening. Whitney states in clear terms: “the r-element which it contains is
not prolonged.” Bhārgava-Bhāskara, disregarding the wording of the rule,
says that the middle third portion is the consonantal r, i.e. the r also undergoes
the process of lengthening. For long r̥̄, his interpretation is especially strange.
According to him. the first entire mātrā of long r̥̄ is purely vocalic, followed by
a half-mātrā of consonantal r, followed by a half-mātrā of a vocalic element.
This directly contradicts the statement of the rule: पूर्वा मात्रा संस्पृष्टरेफा भवति.

Translation: \[The members of\] the l̥-class, \[i.e. l̥, l̥̄, and l̥̄3 ,

Note: This rule, in close parallel with the previous rules, presents the
constitution of l̥ as being equivalent to ∂l∂, or to ∂ll∂ if we accept each constitu-
ent to be of a quarter-mora quantity. It is interesting to note that the CA uses
the term l̥varṇa, suggesting that there are more varieties than just the short l̥.
However, it does not have a specific rule for long \(l̥̄\) and prolonged \(l̥̄3\)
vowels, corresponding to CA \(1.1.38\). The CAB does not cite any example of
these long and prolonged varieties, though the Śikṣā verse cited in the com-
mentary does refer to long l̥̄.

rejects the existence of long l̥̄. On the other hand, the cited verse seems to
accept it.

Note: Bhārgava-Bhāskara offers some informative comments on
vocalic l̥. He says that the long l̥̄ is not found in Sanskrit, except in the alpha-
bets found in the Mantraśāstra. For details, see: Ramajñā Pāṇḍeya, Vyākaraṇa-
darśanapīṭhikā, p. 51, Sarasvatī Bhavana Adhyayanamālā 11, Sampūrṇānanda
Saṃskr̥ta Viśvavidyālaya, Banaras. There are actually several texts which
accept the long l̥̄, though they cannot cite its occurrence in any attested word,
cf. Manomohan Ghosh \(1938: 51\). On the other hand, it is possible to find
an extra-long \(pluta\) l̥̄3 by applying the normal rules of Pāṇini. The pluta l̥̄3 is
not attested among the Vedic examples of pluta vowels, though it is possible,
according to the rules of the Pāṇinian system, to have a form with a pluta l̥̄3.
There is a long debate concerning the inclusion of l̥ in Pāṇini’s Śivasūtra: r̥-l̥-K,
and the MB \(on the Śivasūtra: r̥-l̥-K\) argues that one must include l̥ in the
Śivasūtra r̥-l̥-K, in order to get a prolonged l̥̄3 in vocative forms like
kl̥̄3ptaśikha. Bhārgava-Bhāskara alludes to this discussion. 
The quotation ऌकारः प्लुत एव च is not found in any known works
ascribed to Śaunaka. It is, however, quoted by Ramadev Tripathi \(1977: 75\) as
belonging to verse 5 of the Pāṇinīyaśikṣā. It appears in verse 2 of the
Pāṇinīyaśikṣā reconstructed by Manomohan Ghosh \(1938: 1\). It also occurs
in the Agnipurāṇa version of the Pāṇinīyaśikṣā as verse 3; verse 5 of the
Pāṇinīyaśikṣā presented by the commentary Pañjikā and Śikṣāprakāśa, the
Yajus Recension, and the R̥k Recension. Manomohan Ghosh \(1938: 50, 53\)

162अध्याय १, पाद १
wrongly translates this as: “and the pluta l̥ is duḥspr̥ṣṭa.” The original verse is
simply a continued listing the sounds included in the alphabet and includes the
duḥspr̥ṣṭa sound as well as the prolonged l̥̄3 as belonging to the total listing.
The term duḥspr̥ṣṭa refers to the retroflex ḷ \(= ळ\) found in the R̥gveda, and is
not a description of the prolonged l̥̄3 as understood by Ghosh.

Whitney \(1.40\). Hb, Nb: °वृत्ति. G: 1.1.40. I: 40. O: °न्येवर्ण°. P:
°संसृष्ट°.
Translation: The composite-sounds \[= e, o, ai, and au\] have,
\[within each\], fused \[component\] sounds, and \[yet\] they behave
as single sounds.
Note: Whitney and Allen \(1953: 63\) render the phrase एकवर्णवद् वृत्तिः
by ‘they are treated as single letters.’ In my opinion, a better translation is
offered by ‘they behave...’ The rule thus draws a distinction between the per-
ceived phonetic nature and the phonological behavior. For instance, metrically
these vowels form single syllables.
It is clear from the plural form sandhyakṣarāṇi, that the text refers by
this term to all four sounds, i.e. e, o, ai, and au, and not just to ai and au. As
seen earlier, the ancient Śikṣā text cited in the CAB on CA \(1.1.21, 25\), seems
to say that the sounds e and o have a single point of articulation, in contrast
with ai and au, and that their monophthongal character seems to be supported
by CA \(1.1.34: एकारौकारयोर्विवृततमम्\), the present rule clearly brings them
under the term sandhyakṣara. The term sandhyakṣara is generally translated as
‘diphthong,’ and this raises the question of why the sounds e and o should
come under this term. 
To begin with, we must disabuse ourselves of the notion that the term
sandhyakṣara refers to a diphthong. It refers literally to a composite-sound,
and the composite character is more in terms of their perceived origin, rather
than in terms of their current articulation. Thus, phonetically the sounds e and
o were monophthongs for the CA, and yet in terms of their origin they were
seen as being born out of a combination. Allen \(1953: 64\) says: “It will be
noted that even where the monophthongal value of e/o is phonetically estab-
lished, the feeling for its phonological equivalence to a\+i/u still prevails.”
However, the combination of elements in e and o, as compared to the
combination in ai and au, was perceived to be of a different nature by most

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका163
Sanskrit texts. The first pair represents a true fusion where the components
can no longer be separately perceived, while the second pair has perceptible
components. For the first type of combination, Patañjali uses the term
praśliṣta, while for the second type of combination, he uses the term samāhāra,

Whitney \(1.41\). G: 1.1.41. E, F, O\(orig\): °यो स्था°.
Translation: \[The behavior of the sounds\] ai and au \[as
single sounds\] does not hold in the context of the prescription
of their points of articulation \(sthāna\). 

164अध्याय १, पाद १
Note: The listing of the four sounds in the commentaries is problem-
atic. The rule clearly uses a dual form, and, after dissolving the sandhi in naikā-
raukārayoḥ, it can be sensibly either ekāra\+okārayoḥ, or aikāra\+aukārayoḥ.
Out of these two possibilities, Whitney opted for the second one, while
Bhārgava-Bhāskara, and the CAB too, would like to have it both ways to
include all the four sandhyakṣaras. 
The interpretation I have given above is supported by Whitney. On this
rule, Whitney says: “What the meaning and value of the rule is is not alto-
gether clear: I can see no other application of it than to forbid the inclusion of
ai among the palatals only, and of au among the labials only, since they are
both throat-sounds as well. By implication, then, e and o would admit of being
ranked as merely palatal and labial.” This is in part because Whitney takes the
word sthānavidhi to refer to ‘prescription of the point of articulation.’ The
CAB as well as the ancient Śikṣā verse cited therein are unclear on this rule.
Whitney derives the following meaning from the verse cited in the CAB:
“perhaps the meaning is that, while the beginning and end of āi, for instance,
are clearly a and i, a mora in the middle of the sound is of a mixed character.”
The verse seems to refer to a half-mora element which is of mixed character. I
think this is a plausible interpretation. 
On the other hand, Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary seems to sup-
port an interpretation like: “\[The behavior\] of the sounds e/ai and o/au \[as
single sounds, however\], does not \[hold\] in the context of substitution \[sthāna-
vidhi , i.e. substitution of the constituents of these sounds by protracted varie-
ties\].” Bhārgava-Bhāskara draws our attention to the other possible meaning
of the term sthānavidhi, i.e. substitution, cf. P.1.1.49 \(षष्ठी स्थानेयोगा\). With this
other meaning of the word sthānavidhi, i.e. substitution, there is a different
possible context for this rule. In the context of substitution, the sounds ai and
au do not behave as single sounds, i.e. their different components receive dif-
ferent substitutes. 
The best example to illustrate this different behavior of the components
is offered in the Pāṇinian process of deriving the prolonged versions for e, o,
ai, and au. Compare Pāṇini’s rules P. 8.2.105 \(प्लुतावैच इदुतौ\) and 8.2.106
\(एचोप्रगृह्यस्यादूराद्धूते पूर्वस्यार्धस्यादुत्तरस्येदुतौ\). The first rule says that when ai and
au are prolonged, it is the i and the u elements of these composite sounds that
get prolonged. Thus, a prolonged ai is equivalent to a\+ī3, and a prolonged au
is equivalent to a\+ū3. The next rule says that, for a non-pragr̥hya e, o, ai, or
au, except in a call from afar, the sound e and ai are prolonged to ā3\+i, and o
and au to ā3\+u. Pāṇini’s rules clearly refer to the components in the context of
substitution.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका165
In the examples khaṇvakhā3i and khaimakhā3i offered by Bhārgava-
Bhāskara, we assume that an original e has been changed to ā3i, cf. Bhārgava-
Bhāskara lists khaṇvakhe and khaimakhe as the non-pluta forms under CA
\(1.2.22\). On the other hand, Whitney guesses on CA \(1.4.5 = W 1.96\) that
the original non-pluta forms are ‘probably’ khaṇvakhāi and khaimakhāi. If
Whitney is correct, we have the change of ai to ā3i. However, I agree with the
Roth-Böhtlingk lexicon in considering these forms to be vocatives of the
female frog-names khaṇvakhā and khaimakhā, and hence the non-pluta voca-
tive forms are khaṇvakhe and khaimakhe, rather than khaṇvakhai and khai-
makai. This is also supported by Sāyaṇa on ŚAV \(4.15.15\). Bhārgava-
Bhāskara also offers an example of an original o changing to ā3u in the form
vāyā3u \(< vāyo\). This example is not attested in the ŚAV. 
Of these two possible interpretations, the first one is the more likely
interpretation, because the rule occurs in the context of describing the articula-
tion of sounds, rather than in the context of substitution. The second argument
which goes against the interpretation of Bhārgava-Bhāskara is that the so-called
substitution for different parts of a diphthong in the context of pluta is never
taught as a rule in the CA. It is simply taken for granted, because the pluta
forms appear both in the Saṃhitāpāṭha and the Padapāṭha. Therefore,
Bhārgava-Bhāskara was forced to bring in Pāṇini’s substitution rules, which
clearly refer to components of the diphthongs.

Whitney \(1.42\), A, G, I, Hac, P: °ष्टानः । B, C, D, E, F, Hb, J, K, M,
N, O: °ष्ठानः. G: 1.2.1.
Translation: The ḥ \(= visarjanīya\) is an abhiniṣṭāna \[‘off-
glide’\] sound.
Note: The term abhiniṣṭāna is difficult to interpret, because it does not
occur elsewhere in the grammatical literature, and because, in its few occur-
rences in the Gr̥hya-Sūtras etc. it is simply used as a term referring to visarga;,
for passages in the Gr̥hya-Sūtras, see: Āśvalāyana-Gr̥hya-Sūtra \(1.15.4-5\),
Pāraskara-Gr̥hya-Sūtra \(1.17.1-6\), and Gobhila-Gr̥hya-Sūtra \(2.8.14\). For
further references, see L. Renou \(1942: 376\). But the significance of the term
itself is hardly accounted for. It looks like an older term for visarga or
visarjanīya, which was discontinued in later Sanskrit.
Secondly, the mss. are divided over the readings abhiniṣṭāna and abhi-
niṣṭhāna. Pāṇini \(8.3.86: अभिनिसस्तनः शब्दसंज्ञायाम्\) derives the formation abhi-
niṣṭāna from abhi\+nis\+\!stan as a śabdasaṃjñā ‘technical term referring to a
linguistic unit.’ However, the other reading is not without some justification.
Whitney remarks on this rule: “Pāṇini’s rule must be taken as conclusive re-
specting the derivation and form favored in his time, or by his school; but the
analogy of the words abhinidhāna, abhinihita, abhinihata, abhinipāta cannot but
suggest abhiniṣṭhāna as the true form, coming from the root sthā with the pre-
fixes abhi and ni.” In my own opinion, the form abhiniṣṭāna is the original
form, the lectio difficilior, and hence probably the original reading.
What does the word abhiniṣṭāna mean? Whitney on this rule says:
“The Böhtlingk-Roth lexicon gives it ... the meaning ‘an expiring or vanishing

168अध्याय १, पाद २
sound \(ein verklingender Laut\),’ but this is merely a conjecture, and by no
means so well supported by the etymology of the word \(which would suggest
rather ‘a sounding forth, a resonance’\) as to be placed beyond the reach of
question.” Recently, S.M. Katre \(1987: 1039\) seems to have followed the
Böhtlingk-Roth interpretation in translating the term as ‘a phoneme that dies
away.’ Such an interpretation makes no sense in view of the non-technical
example offered in the KV on P.8.3.86: अभिनिस्तनति मृदङ्गः. Here it must refer
to the reverberations of the sound of the drum. Therefore, I agree with
Whitney’s interpretation. Perhaps, the best modern technical paraphrase would
be ‘off-glide.’ The meaning of the term abhiniṣṭāna is probably close to that of
visarga or visarjanīya, i.e. ‘to be released, emitted.’

Note: Bhārgava-Bhāskara gives a somewhat different interpretation
of the term abhiniṣṭāna. According to him, it does not refer just to a normal
visarga \(i.e. ḥ\), but to visarga as it changes to ḫ \(= jihvāmūlīya\) before k, kh, or
to ẖ \(= upadhmānīya\) before p, ph. Such changes may be due to external or
internal sandhi. We have no way of evaluating Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s inter-
pretation, except to say that it does not agree with the general usage of the term
abhiniṣṭāna in the Gr̥hya-Sūtras, where it seems to be a plain and simple
equivalent of the generic visarga. The CAB also seems to interpret this term as
a generic equivalent of visarga, and the examples it cites are of word-final
visarga before pause. Therefore, the chances of Bhārgava-Bhāskara being cor-
rect are slim.
The example याः फलिनीः is found in RV \(10.97.15\), TS \(4.2.6.4\), and
VS \(12.89\). It is also found in the Mantra-Brāhmaṇa \(1.5.1\), edited by
Satyavrat Sāmaśramī, Calcutta, 1947. It is not traced to any known Āraṇyaka. 
However, Bhārgava-Bhāskara cites it as an Āraṇyaka example. The example
यशस्कल्पम् is found in the KV \(on P.8.3.38: सोऽपदादौ\). For the textual variation
concerning the example कः कफोडौ from AV \(10.2.4\) and its interpretation, see
Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.II., p. 568\). 
१.२.२. व्यञ्जनविधारणमभिनिधानः ।
Whitney \(1.43\), C, E, H, I, N, P: single Sūtra: व्यञ्जनविधारणमभिनिधानः
पीडितः सन्नतरो हीनश्वासनादः । A, B, D: two Sūtras: व्यंजनविधारणमभिनिधानः
पीडितः। संन\(त in D\)तरो हीनश्वासनादः । F, G, J, K, M: the first of the two
Sūtras ends with °धानः ।  G numbers the two Sūtras: 1.2.2, 1.2.3.
Translation: Holding a consonant back \[i.e. not releasing it,
or checking it\] is termed abhinidhāna. 
Note: Following Whitney, Varma \(1929: 137\) and Allen \(1953: 71-
72\) take CA \(1.2.2-3\) as representing a single rule. The manuscripts are split
half and half on this issue. Among the commentaries, the CAB takes the entire

170अध्याय १, पाद २
stretch \(CA 1.2.2-3\) as being a single rule, a definition or description of abhi-
nidhāna. Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary, on the other hand takes these two
to be separate rules. The first rule is a definition of abhinidhāna, while the
second one a definition of the term sannatara. I have given these as two rules,
because mss. from different groups seem to treat these as two rules. The
manuscript G numbers these two rules separately, and with this numbering, the
CA 1.2.10 appears as 1.2.10 in both I and G. On the other hand, I do not
agree with Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s notion that rule 1.2.3 defines a separate term,
i.e. sannatara. I think rule 1.2.3 is simply a supplement to 1.2.2, and, hence is a
further description of abhinidhāna. 
Whitney uses the terms implosion and explosion to refer to the two
phases involved in the pronunciation of consonants. The first step, especially
clear in the case of stops, is indicated by the formation of contact between the
articulator and the point of articulation. The sound becomes more audible with
the release of that contact, referred to by Whitney by the term explosion. When
a stop is followed by another stop, or by a pause, then the utterance of the first
stop basically ends with the first phase, and there does not follow a clear
release of the contact, making the consonant weakly audible. Whitney gener-
ally treats this as a description of indistinct pronunciation. He saw many diffi-
culties in this description, and explained those difficulties “by supposing that
the Hindus had not made a complete physical analysis of the phonomenon, and
hence that their descriptions of it partake of vagueness and inconsistency; and
also, that they have brought together under the name abhinidhāna things not
entirely accordant, although analogous, in character.” 
Since Whitney was unhappy with the first explanation of the notion of
incomplete utterance, he came up with a second hypothesis \(p. 36\): “An alter-
native view to which I have myself been somewhat attracted is that by the
abhinidhāna is meant the instant of silence which intervenes between the clo-
sure of the organs for the first mute, and their opening for the second: that the
Hindu theory regards, in the word āpta, for example, the utterance of the p as
complete by the closure of the lips upon the preceding ā, and that of the t as
complete by the unclosure of the tongue before the following a, while the brief
interval of suspended utterance separating the two acts is abhinidhāna.” A few
modern scholars have taken this to represent Whitney’s final view, cf. Vijay
Shankar Pandeya \(1987: 183\). It is, however, not clear whether Whitney’s
statements concerning the ‘Indian notions of the complete utterance of a stop’
are correct. 
On the other hand, Whitney finally arrives at the following under-
standing \(p. 36\): “Fatal objections, however, to this explanation are: the

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका171
treatment of the phenomenon as something affecting the former consonant, not
interposed after it; the difficulty of assuming any such interval of silence in the
case of a concurrence with sonant and nasal mutes; and the non-applicability of
the theory to the case of a final consonant. The term vyañjanavidhāraṇa must
therefore be understood as used simply in antithesis to the saṃyuktam of rule
49 \(= CA 1.2.9: अतोऽन्यत् संयुक्तम्\): whereas, in other cases of concurrence of
consonants, there is actual combination, with partial assimilation of the latter to
the former \(rule 50 = CA 1.2.10\), here each is held apart from the other as
distinct.” Whitney realizes that this explanation may not be applicable to the
word-final consonants, but states that “it is allowable to regard as contemplated
in a general description or designation of a phonetic phenomenon its principal
case only.”
Allen \(1953: 70ff.\) comes up with a more positive understanding of
this phenomenon. More than an interval of silence, the term abhinidhāna refers
to an unreleased consonant, either before another consonant making the con-
junction weak and excludable from the notion of saṃyukta ‘conjunct conso-
nants,’ or occurring at the word-final position, making the consonant midway
between a voiced or a voiceless consonant, as debated in CA \(1.1.10:
प्रथमान्तानि तृतीयान्तानीति शौनकस्य प्रतिज्ञानं न वृत्तिः\). Allen \(1953: 71\) describes
abhinidhāna as: “the non-release of a consonant, more particularly a stop, when
followed by a stop, and parallels the French term ‘implosion.’” The notion of
‘implosion’ makes eminent sense in the case of a stop followed by a stop,
particularly when we see deaspiration of the first stop, aspiration being a
feature of the release or ‘explosion.’ However, the term abhinidhāna seems to
refer to overall weakening of the initial consonant of a consonant-cluster, and
of the final consonant before pause. This overall weakening makes such
consonants subject to changes of all kinds, especially subject to progressive
assimilation in sandhis and loss of final consonants in Prakrits. Allen \(1953:
70ff\) correctly links this non-release of the consonant with both the contexts,
i.e. a not-too-tight consonantal contact as well as the word-final position. 
It must be noted that the notion of abhinidhāna, its nature, and scope,
were a highly disputed topic among the various traditions, and the phenomenon
probably also varied dialectally, cf. Varma \(1929: 133-147\). For another
recent discussion of this term, also see: Ralf Stautzebach \(1994: 312-313\).

Note: Bhārgava-Bhāskara takes abhinidhāna as a continued descrip-
tion of the visarga and its contextual substitutes. For him, when a visarga, or

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका173
its contextual substitute, combines with the following consonant, both the con-
sonants together are called abhinidhāna. This interpretation cannot be correct. 
१.२.३. पीडितः सन्नतरो हीनश्वासनादः ।
Whitney \(1.43\) combines with the previous Sūtra.
Translation: \[The sound termed abhinidhāna in the previous
rule is\] squeezed, weaker, and has reduced breath or voice.
Note: As explained in the Note on the earlier rule, I have treated this
as a separate rule, and yet I think it is a continuation of the previous descrip-
tion. The term vyañjanavidhāraṇam, in the previous rule, referring to “holding
apart or back” of a consonant, seems like a description of the consequences of
a certain phonetic process, and that process is described more fully in the
present rule. The three terms contained in this rule describe different di-
mensions of this articulatory process. The term pīḍita, lit. ‘pressed,’ seems to
refer to the non-release of the contact between the articulator and the point of
articulation. The term hīnaśvāsanāda refers to weak emission involved,
whether the consonant be voiced or voiceless. 
The term sannatara presents some further difficulties. It is translated by
Whitney \(p. 34\) as ‘quite weakened,’ and Varma \(1929: 137\) and Allen \(1953:
72\) generally follow Whitney. The term avasannatara appears in the Śikṣā
verse cited in the Caturādhyāyībhāṣya on the previous rule. Elsewhere, i.e.
P.1.2.40 \(उदात्तस्वरितपरस्य सन्नतरः\), the term sannatara is used to describe the
lowest pitch level, lower than the normal low-pitch \(anudātta\). This is for a
low-pitch syllable which precedes an udātta ‘high-pitch’ or a svarita ‘rising-
falling’ syllable. Thus, sanna in this context refers to low-pitch, and sannatara
refers to a pitch lower than the normal low-pitch. It is not clear if there is any
shared value in the use of the same term in these two different contexts. Per-
haps, the term implies in a generic manner the low level of effort involved in
both the lowest-pitch vowels, and the unreleased stops, and in this sense may
be comparable to the term laghu-prayatna-tara.

Note: Bhārgava-Bhāskara takes this rule to be a definition of the term
sannatara which he claims applies to a visarga which changes in certain sandhis
in such a way that it survives neither as a sibilant, nor as a y or an r. It is
doubtful if the rule has any such meaning. The term hīna-śvāsa-nāda is taken

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका175
by Bhārgava-Bhāskara to mean a sound which has neither śvāsa nor nāda.
This is clearly unacceptable.
१.२.४. स्पर्शस्य स्पर्शेऽभिनिधानः ।
Whitney \(1.44\). G: 1.2.4. O: °मिधानः.
Translation: Before a stop \[lit. ‘contact consonant,’ includ-
ing the nasals ṅ, ñ, ṇ, n, and m\], there is abhinidhāna \[i.e. lack
of release\] of a stop.
Note: The CA unconditionally refers to all stops, including nasals, in
this rule. This includes conjuncts of homorganic as well as non-homorganic
stops, and it also includes combinations of nasals and non-nasals. One of the
interpretations proposed for abhinidhāna by Whitney was a moment of silence
between the consonants. However, as Whitney himself recognized, such a
moment of silence does not seem possible between, for example, a voiced un-
aspirated stop and a homorganic nasal, because the transition between such
sounds is far smoother. Therefore, the best conception of abhinidhāna is
represented by ‘unreleased’ articulation.

Note: As Whitney notes, out of the three examples cited by the CAB,
only the last example is found in the \(Ś\)AV. The form samidbhiḥ is not found
in AV, and the references listed for this word in Vishva Bandhu’s A Gram-
matical Word-Index to Atharvaveda \(p. 622\) are actually references for the
word samidhaḥ, wrongly ascribed to samidbhiḥ. One may also note that Surya
Kanta has not made the expected suggestion that the first two forms cited by
the CAB, which are not found in the Vulgate of the AV, probably occurred in
the real Śaunakīya recension of the AV which is now lost and that the Vulgate
does not represent the true Śaunakīya recension.

Note: According to Bhārgava-Bhāskara, the whole cluster of stops
gets the designation abhinidhāna. This does not seem to be correct. The
phrase स्पर्शस्य ... अभिनिधानः is comparable to substitution or alteration, in the
classical Pāṇinian fashion, where the genitive case represents the sthānin ‘item
undergoing substitution, item being replaced,’ and the item in the nominative
represents the ādeśa ‘substitute,’ cf. P.1.1.49 \(षष्ठी स्थानेयोगा\).

or at the end of a nominal base\] in separation \[of the members
of a compound or of the base from the case-ending in the
Padapāṭha, a stop is reduced to abhinidhāna\].
Note: Heffner \(1952: 119\): “The contact and hold phases are usually
easy to observe, the release may be obscured, notably for instance, when the
stop is the final element of the breath group. In the phrase, and then he went to
sleep, the final \[p\] of sleep is often not released by the labial “explosion," but
by the lowering of the velum for the resumption of normal breathing, the lips
having simply remained closed. Such a release is usually not audible.”

Note: Bhārgava-Bhāskara also brings the words sparśasya sparśe
pare into this rule and says that this rule applies to a stop which occurs at the
end of a word and is followed by the initial stop the next word. With this in-
terpretation, he says that the previous rule applies to stops in non-final position.
For Bhārgava-Bhāskara to be correct, one must assume that one is
dealing with external sandhi applications, and not with what happens to the
word-final stop in the Padapāṭha before pause. In that case, the rule would be
dealing with two entirely unrelated situations, one a situation of a word-final
stop followed by a word-initial stop, and the second a situation where the
word-final stop is followed by an avagraha, a mini-pause to mark the separa-
tion of the members of a compound in the Padapāṭha. This seems to be a very
unlikely combination. The best way is to take this rule to apply to the word-
final stops before pause in the Padapāṭha. 

178अध्याय १, पाद २
Another feature of Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s interpretation is that he views
the term abhinidhāna as applying to both the stops involved in a conjunct. This
does not seem to be correct.
It is interesting to note that all the instances of the word hiraṇmaya-
listed in Vishva Bandhu’s Grammatical Word-Index to the Atharvaveda \(p.
678\) are from the Paippalāda Atharvaveda. However, it should be noted that
the word hiraṇmaya as a variant for hiraṇyaya does occur in the mss. of the
ŚAV. See the variants given for hiraṇyayīm in AV \(10.2.33\) in the VVRI
edition.
१.२.६. लकारस्योष्मसु ।
Whitney \(1.46\). G: 1.2.6.
Translation: The consonant l \[is reduced to abhinidhāna\]
before spirants.
Note: Whitney notes that “only spirants before which l is found actu-
ally to occur in the Atharvaveda are ś and h.” Whitney has discussed the de-
tails of how this notion is highly eclectic and that other treatises propose differ-
ent treatments for l under similar circumstances. His own response to this
prescription, however, is: “I must confess myself unable to explain why either
l before a spirant, or the nasals before h, as taught in the next rule, should suf-
fer or be regarded as suffering the obscuring process of abhinidhāna.” As far
as the case of the abhinidhāna taught by the present rule is concerned, Varma
\(1929: 147\) says: “This probably refers to a sporadic phenomenon in some of
the dialects, for in the majority of cases we should expect Svarabhakti after l or
r before fricatives. The fact that this sporadic phenomenon actually existed in
some dialects is corroborated by Prākrit vassa-, side by side with, in the major-
ity of cases, varisa-, valiśa-.”

and proves it to be bálhika, and not báhlika; the mss. vary between the two, the
majority giving -lh-; but the testimony of no ms. is of any authority on this
particular point; Ppp. appears to have -hl-.” The APR \(175: गल्हे विल्हौ हकारान्तः

the Orissa mss regularly have -lih-, -liś- etc. The last two examples cited by
the CAB are also found, though in reverse order, in APR \(175\). Contrast

Note: Half of Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary is occupied in giv-
ing examples of the combinations of l with non-spirants, where he says the
abhinidhāna does not occur. The examples show his familiarity with the
R̥gveda, and the Taittirīya school of the Kr̥ṣṇa Yajurveda. It is, however, not
clear why the example alāṇḍūn is offered. Here, we have an instance of l fol-
lowed by a vowel.
१.२.७. ङणनानां हकारे ।
Whitney \(1.47\). G: 1.2.7.
Translation: The sounds ṅ, ṇ, and n \[are reduced to abhini-
dhāna\] before h.

180अध्याय १, पाद २
Note: Whitney on the previous rule expresses his inability to explain
why the change prescribed by the present rule should occur, and for some
reason, Varma’s \(1929\) extensive discussion of abhinidhāna does not cover
the cases which come under the present rule. The only real examples from the
AV are those of ṅ and n being followed by h. This occurs only for word-final
ṅ and n before word-initial h, in the Saṃhitāpāṭha. In the Padapāṭha, the word-
final ṅ and n would be followed by a pause, and hence would be reduced to
abhinidhāna by CA \(1.2.5\). These sequences do not occur word-internally.
The example with sugaṇ offered in the commentaries is an artificial example. It
is, then, not entirely clear why ṇ was included in this rule. Fabricated examples
with gaṇ or sugaṇ are found in the CAB on CA \(2.1.9\) and \(3.2.2\), and also in
the Śikṣā verse cited in the CAB on CA \(3.2.2\). The late commentators in the
Pāṇinian tradition also resort to sugaṇ, cf. Siddhāntakaumudī on P.8.3.32 \(ङमो
ह्रस्वादचि ङमुण्नित्यम्\). One may note that the KV on the same rule comes up with
an example with an artificial vaṇ.

Translation: \[The abhinidhāna is\] also called āsthāpita

Note: The CAB seems to say that āsthāpita is simply another name for
the abhinidhāna. Whitney has followed the CAB in interpreting āsthāpita as
just another name for the abhinidhāna. He says that this alternative title “does
not notably help our comprehension of it \(= abhinidhāna\): the word admits of
being translated, in accordance with the explanation of abhinidhāna offered

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका181
above, ‘made to stand up to, or against;’ but it may also be rendered ‘stopped,’
that is, ‘silenced,’ and so may favor another theory of the phenomenon.” Allen
\(1953: 72\) follows Whitney, except that he translates the term āsthāpita as
‘arrested,’ and takes it to be just another name for abhinidhāna.
RPR \(4.1\) uses the term āsthāpita to refer to consonant\+consonant
sandhi. It is therefore likely that the terms āsthāpita and abhinidhāna would
have a largely overlapping area of application.

‘इ॒च्छन्ति॑’ \(अ.वे. २०.१८.३\)।
Note: Quite a different interpretation for the rule is proposed by
Bhārgava-Bhāskara in his commentary. He takes the term āsthāpita as being
equivalent to āgama ‘augment, appended item,’ in the Pāṇinian tradition.
According to his explanation, the consonantal augments inserted between either
two consonants, or between a consonant and a vowel, are referred to by the
term āsthāpita. According to him, such a consonantal augment, along with the
preceding and the following consonant is given the name abhinidhāna. 
For instance, in an example like tān\+savitaḥ, by following CA \(2.1.9:
ङणनानां कटतैः शषसेषु\), a euphonic t is inserted between the final n and the initial
s, giving us tān-t-savitaḥ. According to the interpretation suggested by
Bhārgava-Bhāskara, this euphonic t would be reduced to an abhinidhāna, i.e.
‘an unreleased stop.’ The dialectal instability of such augments is indicated by
the fact that these are made optional in Pāṇini \(8.3.28-31\). The abhinidhāna
character of such a sound would indeed manifest in such instability. However,
we do not have any way to confirm independently that the term āsthāpita was
used to refer to such ‘augments.’

182अध्याय १, पाद २
The examples प्र॒त्यङ्ङुदे॑षि॒ and आ॒व॒र्त्स्यन्न॑मन्यत need to be distinguished
from other examples. Here, the augments ṅ and n are immediately preceded by
ṅ and n, but are followed by vowels. 
It may also be noted that the manuscripts of the AV do not exhibit these
readings with the added augments.
१.२.९. अतोऽन्यत्संयुक्तम् ।
Whitney \(1.49\). G: 1.2.9. A, B, D:  °त्प° for °न्य°.
Translation: \[A consonant, involved in a consonant\+conso-
nant combination\], other than these \[i.e. listed under the cate-
gory of abhinidhāna\], is called saṃyukta ‘conjunct.’
Note: It should be noted that the scope of the notion of saṃyoga is
different from that of the term saṃyukta, though both of these terms are ety-
mologically related. The term saṃyoga as used in CA \(1.2.11: ह्रस्वं लघ्वसंयोगे\)
and CA \(1.4.7: व्यञ्जनान्यव्यवेतानि स्वरैः संयोगः\) encompasses all consonant\+
consonant combinations, including those covered under abhinidhāna. On the
other hand, the term saṃyukta excludes the cases of abhinidhāna. It would
seem that the distinction between abhinidhāna and saṃyukta was phonetically
relevant, but not grammatically. Probably for this reason, Pāṇini used only the
broad notion of saṃyoga, cf. P.1.1.7 \(हलोऽनन्तराः संयोगः\), and dispensed with
the distinction between abhinidhāna and saṃyukta.

Note: Both the manuscripts write त्रि as तृ or नृ. All the examples
cited by the CAB are artificial examples produced by combinations and per-
mutations of a few words. It is again interesting to note that Surya Kanta does
not claim these as belonging to the so-called lost recension of the genuine
Śaunakīya AV. Surya Kanta’s overall argument is weakened by the obvious
existence of such a large number of non-AV examples in this commentary.
Examples with śete, sāye, and ṣaṇḍe are found in the KV on P.8.3.28, 29, 30,
and 36. These examples are not textual quotations, but possible usages.
The wording of the CAB, i.e. अन्ये अभिनिधानात् पदान्तात्, creates an im-
pression that the term saṃyoga applies to cases of contact between a final and
an initial, but, as Whitney correctly notes, such is not the case.

184अध्याय १, पाद २
Note: Bhārgava-Bhāskara adds another important consideration,
namely that the term saṃyukta not only excludes the cases of abhinidhāna, but
that it also excludes the cases of abhiniṣṭāna as defined in CA \(1.2.1: विसर्ज-
नीयोऽभिनिष्टानः\). Additionally, he includes the combination of an anusvāra with
a consonant under the term saṃyukta. Such a separate listing of the anusvāra
is prompted by the unclear position of the anusvāra in relation to the distinction
between vowels and consonants. The RPR \(1.22: अनुस्वारो व्यञ्जनं च\) also lists
anusvāra separately, because of the ambiguous position of the anusvāra, cf.
RPR \(1.5: अनुस्वारो व्यञ्जनं वा स्वरो वा\).
१.२.१०. पूर्वरूपस्य मात्रार्धं समानकरणं परम् ।
Whitney \(1.50\). G: 1.2.10. I: 10.
Translation: The final half-mora of the previous \[consonant,
in a case of consonant\+consonant combination\) has the same
karaṇa \[= articulator or mode of articulation?\] as the following
\[consonant\].
Note: Whitney first says that the word karaṇa in the rule should not
be restricted to the notion of ‘organ,’ or articulator, but should be broadly in-
terpreted in the sense of ‘mode of production.’ He then points out the main
difficulty in interpreting this rule: “Of the accuracy of the physical observations
which could discover any actual assimilation of the first element of these \(e.g.
ts, st\) and other similar combinations, in its final portion, to the latter, I find it
hard to say much in praise: I am unable to discover that any part of the t in vat-
sau becomes an s, or any part of s in vaste a t, any more than the s and t. One
way of interpreting this rule is to say that in combinations like ts, the transition
between t and s is marked by something like th which shares the features of
both t and s. The rule in general may mark the propensity toward progressive
assimilation.”
Also compare Heffner \(1952: 120\): “The precise nature of the move-
ments made to effect the contact of a stop consonant are determined \(a\) by the
position or positions at which the stop is produced, and \(b\) by the position or
positions from which the articulating organs have to move to get there. Any
sound produced during these movements is inevitably a constantly changing
sound: the contact phase or the onset of stop consonants is therefore sometimes
called the on-glide of the consonant. Usually the audible sound produced by
this onset is a modification of the preceding speech sound, whether vowel or
consonant.” The CA may be hinting at a modification of this type.

Note: Whitney draws our attention to the fact that this rule is itself a

source, and that the commentary quotes it as the first half of a verse. This
raises a possibility that the metrical authority is older than the CA. It seems
less likely that a text would take a line from the CA and would turn it into a full
Śloka by adding a second half.

Note: Whitney correctly takes the rule as referring to a syllable: “The
distinction of syllables, as regards their metrical value, is properly into light
\(laghu\) and heavy \(guru\); long \(dīrgha\) and short \(hrasva\) are terms to be used
of vowels only. The neuter gender of the terms in the rule is to be explained by
their agreement with akṣaram, ‘syllable,’ understood.” While the CAB does
not explicitly refer to the agreement with the term akṣaram, this is clearly seen
in Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary.

Translation: \[Any\] other syllable \[is called\] heavy.
Note: Under the category of heavy syllable, we include \(a\) syllables
with long vowels, and \(b\) syllables with short vowels followed by consonant
clusters. Bhārgava-Bhāskara also adds syllables which end in consonants and
visarga. He adds one more category, i.e. syllables with specially accented
vowels, i.e. syllables with svarita vowels. This last category is not substanti-
ated by any other text, and probably rests on a faulty citation from Piṅgala’s
Chandaḥsūtra. Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s citation reads तथा स्वरव्यञ्जनान्तम्, and this
forces him to come up with this last category. The original reading from
Piṅgala is: प्लुतस्वरं व्यञ्जनान्तम्. Here Piṅgala specifically adds the tri-moraic
pluta vowels. This would be automatically taken care of by our CA rule. 
What is the purpose of defining the terms laghu and guru? These
notions are not purposefully used ever again in the CA, the way they are used
either by Pāṇini, or by the metrical texts. The commentary of Kr̥ṣṇadāsa on
this rule clearly says: अत्र शास्त्रे लघुगुरुप्रयोजनाभावः, ‘there is no purpose for the
terms light and heavy in this system.’

१.२.१३. अनुनासिकं च ।
Whitney \(1.53\). G: 1.2.13.
Translation: \[A syllable with\] a nasalized \[vowel is\] also
\[heavy\]. 
Note: From a metrical point of view of the late MIA period, there is a
distinction between nasalizing a vowel and adding an anusvāra. For instance,
referring to Jaina Prakrits, A.M. Ghatage \(1941: 11\) says: “The Anunāsika
does not change the quantity of a syllable, but Anusvāra makes it long.” It is
not quite clear what the situation was in Sanskrit, because the nasalized vowels
are not attested in metrical texts where the nasalization would make metrical
difference. Pāṇini distinguishes an anunāsika from an anusvāra, cf. P.8.3.4
\(अनुनासिकात् परोऽनुस्वारः\). It is clear that nasalization has nothing to do with the
light/contrast. What is not clear is whether an anusvāra made a vowel long.
However, the CA does not make any such clear distinction between an
anusvāra and an anunāsika vowel, and while it does use the term anunāsika, it
does not use the term anusvāra. Varma \(1929: 148\) argues that in spite of the
fact that the CA does not use the term anusvāra, it has the same notion of
anusvāra as other phonetic texts. For a detailed discussion of the complicated
issues, see: Varma \(1929: 148ff\); Allen \(1953: 40ff\). In any case, the CA
considers a nasalized short vowel to form a heavy syllable. In terms of its met-
rical value, the notion of anunāsika in the CA is functionally identical with that
of anusvāra elsewhere. For instance, verse \(1.4\) from Piṅgala’s Chandaḥsūtra

190अध्याय १, पाद २
quoted in Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary on the previous rule makes a
sānusvāra ‘a vowel with the \[following\] anusvāra’ into a heavy syllable.

Whitney \(1.54\). G: 1.2.14. I: पादान्ते च ।
Translation: Also at the end of a word \[before pause, as in
the Padapāṭha, a syllable is considered to be heavy\].
Note: The Sanskrit tradition is more familiar with short syllables at
the end of metrical lines being treated heavy for metrical purposes. This
accounts for the variant reading पादान्ते च in ms. I. Also see Bhārgava-
Bhāskara’s commentary on CA \(1.2.12\). 
The examples cited by the CAB make Whitney think that the rule is re-
stricted to such final syllables as end with a consonant, and in corroboration, he
refers to TPR \(xxii. 14. 15\). However, Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary in-
cludes word-final short vowels, as well as final syllables with short vowels,
ending in a consonant. This would indicate that in the recitation of the ŚAV
Padapāṭha as known to Bhārgava-Bhāskara, the word-final short vowels were
recited as long vowels. This possibility is missed by Whitney and Allen
\(1953: 85\). Since such a recitational practice was commonplace for short
vowels occurring at the end of metrical feet, it seems likely to have been ex-
tended to all final vowels before pause.

Whitney \(1.55\). G: 1.2.15.
Translation: \[In the syllabic segmentation\], consonants
belong to the following vowel.
Note: As Whitney notes, most Prātiśākhyas agree with each other on
this doctrine. Thus, the word dadhi would be segmented into da-dhi, and
madhu would be segmented into ma-dhu. Varma \(1929: 55ff\) has gone into a
detailed examination of the rules of syllabication in the Prātiśākhyas. Also see:
Allen \(1953: 81ff\). This is of course a general rule. Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s
commentary offers many examples of word-initial consonant-clusters which go
with the following vowel.
Allen \(1953: 82\) considers the CA treatment of syllabic division as rep-
resenting the generic rules. He also shows that other Prātiśākhyas hold dif-
fering views on this matter: “the RP allows either the division of a medial
consonant-group or its attachment in toto to the following vowel, and the TP
attaches to the following vowel a group consisting of consonant\+semivowel or
stop\+fricative.” Allen refers to Chatterji’s opinion that the Nāgarī graphic
system may be based on such a syllabic structure. My own conjecture is that
the syllabic division allowed by these two texts may have been a result of
confusing the notion of written syllable with a spoken syllable, as is certainly
evidenced by the syllabic division of the famous Gāyatrī mantra found in one
of the Atharva-Pariśiṣṭas, i.e. Anulomakalpa \(p.146, Atharvaveda-Pariśiṣṭa,

and the Note thereupon for a possible reconstruction as: अपर आह - सयमं
पूर्वस्येति.
Also compare the wording of VPR \(1.102: संयोगादिः पूर्वस्य\).
While Whitney may be right in criticizing the CAB for offering fabri-
cated examples like atra sati, it is not clear to me what to make of Whitney’s
following comment: “he \(= commentator\) does not note for us the fact that, in
the combinations which he presents, the former consonant is to be doubled, by
iii. 28, and then inform us to which of the two products of duplication the pre-
cept of the rule applies.” The rule seems to be a generic enough rule, giving a
basic principle, and it does not matter at this stage what the length of the con-
sonant-cluster is. 
The passage of the commentary अपर आह हसयमं पूर्वस्येति probably re-
stores to अपर आह - सयमं पूर्वस्येति. This comment would then mean that an ini-
tial consonant of a cluster, along with yama, belongs to the previous syllable.

Bhārgava-Bhāskara also points out that by the force of ca ‘and,’ the
rule also refers to anusvāra and visarga as they occur before consonants
\(व्यञ्जने परे\). This would assume that the rule applies to the Saṃhitāpāṭha,
where the final sound of the previous word is immediately followed, without a
gap, by the initial of the next word. It is doubtful whether the rule is meant to
apply to word-final consonants in other than pre-pausal situations. In all prob-
ability, the rule applies only to the Padapāṭha.

Note: Whitney justifiably complains about the lack of specificity in
the explanation given by the CAB, and the lax orthography of the examples as
found in the mss. does not offer any help either. 
However, what the rule means is clear. CA \(3.2.8: रेफहकारौ परं
ताभ्याम्\), like P.8.4.46 \(अचो रहाभ्यां द्वे\), prescribes doubling of the consonant
following r and h. Thus, for instance, in the example arkaḥ, by applying CA
\(3.2.8\), we get the sequence arkkaḥ. The present rule then says that the first of
the doubled consonant, along with the preceding r or h, becomes part of the
previous syllable, i.e. the syllabic division is ark-kaḥ, rather than ar-kkaḥ. The
writing of the mss. does not show these doubled consonants in the examples.
Whitney includes the example विह्नुते on the basis of other passages in
his manuscript, though this example is not found in the commentary on this
rule in the manuscript H which was the only manuscript accessible to Whitney.
Interestingly, the manuscript N supports Whitney’s inclusion of this example.
Also see the commentary on CA \(3.2.8\) and the Note thereupon. The only
Saṃhitā form attested for vi\+\!hnu imanuscript variant vihnutasya for vi-
hvr̥tasya in PAV \(20.13.8\). Also compare the text of the commentary on CA
3.2.8. The readings of the examples there support Whitney’s emendations in
most cases.

Note: We are happily surprised that Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commen-
tary answers all the objections Whitney had against the CAB. It gives a crisp
interpretation, and the ms. G shows the doubled consonants in writing. Be-
sides other elements in the interpretation, Bhārgava-Bhāskara appropriately
points out that this doubling of the consonant after r or h occurs only if this
group comes after a vowel \(स्वरात् पराभ्याम्\). This condition on CA \(3.2.8: रेफ-
हकारौ परं ताभ्याम्\) is provided by the continuing expression svarāt from CA \(3.
2.3\). Unfortunately, the CAB on CA \(3.2.3\) does not make this clear. With
this condition, CA \(3.2.8\) becomes a close equivalent of P.8.4.46 \(अचो रहाभ्यां
द्वे\).

Note: Referring to the Indian attempts to fix the duration of vowels
etc. in minute units of 1/8 of a mora etc., Allen \(1953: 84\) says: “this un-
phonological approach undergoes a further degeneration in statements such as
the following \(from the Pāṇinīya-Śikṣā verse 49\): ‘1 mātrā is equivalent to the
cry of the blue jay, 2 mātrās to that of the crow, 3 mātrās to that of the pea-
cock, and 1/2 mātrā to that of the mongoose.’” I certainly agree with Allen that
such descriptions are unphonological. However, I do not believe that it rep-
resents any degeneration. Part of the problem lies in using the dichotomy of
phonetic versus phonological in reference to Indian texts, which know of no
such overt theoretical distinction. I have discussed some of these issues in the
Introduction. Secondly, once we realize that a mātrā is a unit of time, there
ought to be at least an approximate indication of how long a unit of time a
mātrā is and such a need is fulfilled by the statements like the one quoted from
the Pāṇinīya-Śikṣā. Another reason I am not willing to accept the notion of
degeneration is that it assumes that the earlier texts were free from this practice.
However, even the great Pāṇini seems to refer to a rooster-call in his rule
defining the duration of short, long and extra-long vowels, cf. P.1.2.27
\(ऊकालोऽज्झरस्वदीर्घप्लुतः\)Whitney also refers to RPR \(xiii. 20\) which “attempts
to fix the length of the short, long, and protracted vowels, by comparing them
with the cries of certain birds.” Many texts in Indian music also define the

198अध्याय १, पाद २
various musical notes by referring to bird-calls. In a pre-modern age, these
were the only available means of approximately indicating the length, pitch etc.
The one point which goes against trying to fix the absolute duration of
short, long etc. is that the Sanskrit grammarians do admit that there are different
modes of delivery \(vr̥tti\) such as fast \(druta\), medium \(madhya\), and slow
\(vilambita\), and that fixing absolute durations would militate against the notion
of different speeds of delivery. Whitney, I believe, is correct in saying: “It is
the fundamental measure, which cannot itself be defined by anything else.”

Translation: The consonants too \[are of one-mora duration

Note: Almost all other texts consider consonants to be of half-mora
length. The commentary of Bhārgava-Bhāskara struggles in vain to reconcile
the CA view with the general view. It does bring up the topic of the possible
metrical value of setting a specific duration for consonants, but does not tackle
it successfully. For a clear analysis of this subject, see: Allen \(1953: 86\).

with four mātrās, cf. MB on P.1.1.51, \(Kielhorn edn.\), Vol. I, p. 120. On
P.8.2.106, Patañjali clearly says that a pluta of four mora duration is desirable:
इष्यत एव चतुर्मात्रः प्लुतः.  Allen \(1953: 84\) notes: “The pluta or protracted
vowel ... is of rare occurrence and is bound to a very limited series of contexts;
it represents the over-lengthening of the final vowel of a word or phrase and is

Translation: The final \[consonants\] of ṣaṣ and puras are

Note: Whitney points out that the words ṣoḍaśa and puroḍāśa are not
analyzed in the Padapāṭha, and are not restored to their theoretical original form
in their repetition. This point is also made by Bhārgava-Bhāskara: अनयोर्नित्य-
मेवंविधं रूपम् । न त्ववग्रहो, न समापत्तिः. In a way, Whitney is right in saying: “and
our treatise, accordingly, according to its own programme, has nothing to do
with them: and the same is true of the words referred to in the three following
rules.” The original reason why these words are not analyzed in the Padapāṭha
may be identical with sandehāt ‘excessive fusion / confusion of the consti-
tuents’ given in CA \(4.2.5: षोडशी सन्देहात्\). See the Note on CA \(4.2.5\). The
rules here mark progress of the analytical tradition beyond the state of sandeha
manifest in the Padapāṭha. This is a move in the direction of general grammar.

Whitney \(1.64\). G: 1.3.2. 
Translation: The r of \[the root\] \!kr̥p is replaced by l.
Note: The rule is expected to apply to both, the r which is inside the
vowel r̥ \(∂r∂\), as well as r occurring independently. Thus, effectively the rule
changes kr̥p to kl̥p, and karp to kalp. The commentary CAB on this rule is
missing in the manuscript H, and hence was not available to Whitney. It is,
however, found in the ms. N. The Caturādhyāyībhāṣya offers examples of kr̥p
changing to kl̥p, but not of karp changing to kalp. Such examples from the text
of the ŚAV are offered by Bhārgava-Bhāskara. This rule also marks an
advance beyond the Padapāṭha, which does not change l > r. There is also no
Samāpatti of l to r. Thus, one may make a conjecture that the awareness of
such a linkage of kr̥p to kl̥p may have arisen in the post-Padapāṭha period.
Compare P.8.2.18 \(कृपो रो लः\). Also note that Pāṇini refers to the root as kr̥p,
while the CA refers to the root with the form kr̥pi, with kr̥peḥ as a genitive.
Whitney also makes an interesting comment: “None of the other
Prātiśākhyas offers anything equivalent. If our treatise has set itself to note the
words in which a l appears in the place of a more original r, it should not pass
over the words in which the root car becomes cal, as avicācala, puṃścalī, etc.,
glaha and glahana, which are hardly to be separated from the root grah, udum-
bala \(viii.6.17\), etc.” One can perhaps derive a different inference from the rule
as it stands, as well as from a number of rules that follow. While in this case,
the change of kr̥p to kl̥p is taught by the rule, suggesting that an etymological

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका203
linkage was acceptable to Indian grammarians, other cases mentioned by
Whitney may not have been so acceptable to them. For example, Pāṇini’s
Dhātupāṭha separately lists car, cal, grah, and glah. On the other hand, as CA
\(1.3.4: लकारस्य रेफः ...\) indicates, the author of the CA asks us to change l to r
in a number of words, where modern linguists may perhaps think of the re-
verse direction of historical change. In any case, the rule does not indicate any
‘historical’ change. It does indicate, however, that for some not very explicit
reasons, the r was felt to be derivationally more basic in some words, while in
other words the sound l was felt to be more basic. For a similar discussion,
see: Patañjali on P.8.2.18 \(कृपो रो लः\).

Note: As Whitney points out: “This is the first instance in our treatise
of a rule stated in this form, the words or phrases to which the precept con-
tained in the rule refers being conceived to form a series, or gaṇa, of which the
first only is given in the rule, and the others comprehended in an et cetera. The
form of statement is characteristic of the Atharva Prātiśākhya \(= CA\) and of
Pāṇini.” It is possible that the CA itself intended ‘et cetera,’ and may not have
had a fixed list in mind. No fixed list is known to the APR, or the commenta-
tors. Patañjali, under P.8.2.18 \(कृपो रो लः\), also makes a similar statement:
कृपणादीनां प्रतिषेधो वक्तव्यः । कृपणः, कृपाणः, कृपीटम्. Referring to kr̥paṇaḥ and
kārpaṇyam, Whitney says: “If these two words, which come from altogether
another root, actually belong to the gaṇa, it should contain also kr̥pamāṇasya
\(v.19.13\) and akr̥pran \(xviii.3.23\).”

Note: While the manuscript H contains the reading कृपस्विः, Whitney’s
conjecture कृपात्स्वः is supported by the manuscript N. Whitney’s edition of the
AV and his Index Verborum also read कृ॒पात्स्वः॑. However, he thinks that the
reading कृ॒पात्स्वः॑ “doubtless is a corrupt one, and should be kr̥pā svaḥ, as is read
by both the Sāma and Yajur-Vedas, in their corresponding verses.” The VVRI
edition \(Vol. 2, p. 897-8\) records कृ॒पात्स्वः॑, but notes that several sources, in-
cluding Sāyaṇa’s commentary, do offer the reading कृ॒पा स्वः॑.

Whitney \(1.66\), Hac: °लि° for °रि°. A, B, P\(corr\): Daṇḍa after रेफः.
G: 1.3.4.
Translation: In pādam aṅgurim etc., the sound l is replaced
by r.
Note: In his translation, Whitney says ‘In pādam aṅgulim etc.’ This
is because, following his lone ms. H, he reads the rule itself as ‘... pādam
aṅgulim ...’ This is not supported by other manuscripts. However, Whitney
did guess correctly: “It is not in accordance with the usage of our treatise else-
where to give, in citing a word or phrase in a rule, another form than that which
it actually has it in the text: we should have expected here पादमङ्गुरिमि°.”
Whitney’s expectation is supported by the mss. Again it is not clear here if the
text of the CA intended a fixed set of instances. The commentary of Bhārgava-
Bhāskara probably correctly says that the expression ādi in the rule is to refer
to this type of examples: आदिशब्दः प्रकारार्थः.

Note: Referring to the testimony of the Vedic reciters used by S.P.
Pandit, Lanman says: “The student should bear in mind the especial weight of
the oral testimony in cases where errors of the eye, as distinguished from
errors of the ear, are probable. Thus the testimony of the reciters, at
ix.8\(13\).20, establishes the reading visalpa-, as against visalya- of the Berlin
text. Save in AV., the word is otherwise unknown, and, the ms.-distinction
between lya and lpa in such a case is worthless, the instance is a typical one to
show the value of the reciters’ reading: see W’s note to vi.127.1,” Editor’s in-
troduction, Whitney’s AV translation, Vol. I, pp. lxvi-lxvii. It may thus be
said that, to some extent, Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s reading visalpaka is closer to
the reading offered by the Vedic reciters. Also, it may be noted that while one
does observe the variation visalpaka / visarpaka, the same cannot be said for
the word visalyaka, which marks a greater deviation. As Whitney \(AV Transl.
Vol.II., p. 967\) informs: “For visalpakas \(in AV 1the comm. gives
visarpakas, explaining it as vividhaṃ saraṇaśīlo vraṇaviśeṣaḥ; Ppp. has viśa-
lyakas.”
In his commentary, Bhārgava-Bhāskara has given a very interesting
collection of examples where the sounds r and l occur as variants. Some of
these examples are also offered by Patañjali on P.8.2.18: वालमूललघ्वलमङ्गुलीनां

Note: Referring to the CAB, Whitney says: “The commentator offers
here only the words viṃśatiḥ \(e.g. v.15.2\) and payāṃsi \(e.g. i.9.3\) - which are
very ill chosen, since, though each offers an example of a nasalized vowel,
neither exhibits an elision of an original nasal mute, according to any rules
contained in this treatise.” One must however point out that in the example
payāṃsi, at least according to the Pāṇinian derivation, one would have a dele-
tion of an n. Compare the examples offered by the commentators under
P.8.3.24 \(नश्चापदान्तस्य झलि\). One crucial difference is that the Pāṇinian com-
mentators assume that a form like yaśāṃsi is derived from the string yaśāns\+i,
where the n is replaced by the anusvāra by P.8.3.24. Instead of the notion of
an anusvāra, the CAB speaks of an anunāsika as a replacement for the vowel
preceding the deleted n. It is, however, not clear if such examples were in-
tended by the author of the CA, and whether he intended a similar derivation
for forms like payāṃsi. 
The deficiency pointed out by Whitney is made up by some of the
examples offered by Bhārgava-Bhāskara. However, some of his examples,
would properly come under the next rule. Additionally, Bhārgava-Bhāskara
says that the inclusion of m serves no purpose in this rule, except that n and m
together continue into the following rules. For the last example quoted by
Bhārgava-Bhāskara, see CA 2.1.28.

Note: The example ऋतूँर्ऋतुभिः cited by the CAB is not found in the
Vulgate of the AV, and Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 40\) suggests that
this may have occurred in the genuine Śaunakīya recension of the AV, and that
the Vulgate is not the genuine Śaunakīya recension. The last three examples
cited by the CAB are found under APR \(197\). 
The last comment made by the CAB is not immediately clear. What
does the term punar-grahaṇa refer to? Whitney says: “As the n must always be
converted into the spirant visarjanīya before it becomes y, it seems superfluous
to make separate mention of the latter in the rule. The commentator apparently
feels this objection, and ventures for once a defense, as follows: ūṣmaṇo
grahaṇāt siddhe punargrahaṇena kim : nityatvaṃ na syāt : r̥tũr utsr̥jate vaśī;
‘when the matter is made certain by the use of the term ūṣman, why any farther
mention? It is because this does not apply to all cases, as is shown by the
instance r̥tũr utsr̥jate vaśī.’ I do not see the point of this defense: it does,
indeed explain the mention of r in the rule, but it has nothing to do with that 
of y.”
CA 2.1.29 \(ऋतूँरुत्सृजते वशीत्येवमादीनाम्\) requires the obligatory change
of an n into an r in the listed examples. Thus, in this case, r is not covered by
the term ūṣman, and hence its separate mention is necessary. How about y?
Whitney says, an n must first change to a visarjanīya before it becomes y. If
such is the case, then why is it mentioned again? I think the explanation given
by the commentator applies more aptly to the case of y, though his example
only illustrates the case of r. In an example like rathān iva, the final n first
changes to a visarjanīya by CA \(2.1.27: आकारोपधस्योपबद्धादीनां स्वरे\). Then the

अध्याय १, पाद ३
210
visarjanīya is changed to y by CA \(2.2.2: स्वरे यकारः\). Finally, by CA \(2.1.21:
स्वराद्यवयोः पदान्तयोः\), this y is deleted. The commentator assumes the following
dilemma. One could apply CA \(1.3.6\) at the stage rathāḥ iva and change this to
rathā̃ḥ iva, with the assumption that the vowel ā is followed by ḥ, an ūṣman.
However, if one chose not to do so, and change ḥ first to y, then, in the stage
rathāy iva, one may not be able to nasalize ā without a distinct mention of y. In
part, this brings up the question of whether a substitute can be treated as being
a functional equivalent of the original \(sthānivadbhāva\). The fact that the rule
separately mentions y may be taken as an indication that the CA implicitly had
a doctrine of sthānivadbhāva \(cf. P.1.1.56 स्थानिवदादेशोऽनल्विधौ\), where the
restriction analvidhau ‘not in operations dependent on the specific sound’
would have prevented the substitute y from being attributed the phonological
properties of the ḥ it replaced.
The reading found in Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary, however, is
परोष्मापत्तौ च, and it has been interpreted in a substantially different manner by
this commentary. The significant thing to note is that this reading is not unique
to Bhārgava-Bhāskara, but is supported by a number of other manuscripts, i.e.
E, F, G, I, J \(corr\), O. This includes the entire Kautsa-Vyākaraṇa tradition. In
spite of the manuscript support, I do not believe that this is the original reading.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका211
Translation: Also, when a nasalized \[vowel\] combined
with a preceding \[non-nasal\] vowel is replaced by a single
substitute, \[that single substitute becomes nasalized\].
Note: The existence of a rule such as this may be an indication that a
doctrine similar to Pāṇini’s rule P. 1.1.50 \(स्थानेऽन्तरतमः\) is not fully developed
in the CA tradition. Pāṇini’s procedure requires that a substitute should be
maximally similar in phonetic features to the original it replaced. Such a gene-
ric convention obviates the need for further specialized rules like CA \(1.3.7\).
Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary correctly says that the author of the CA
feared that, without such a special rule, the combined result of a nasal and a
non-nasal vowel would be a non-nasal \[lit. śuddha ‘pure’\] vowel. The exam-
ple illustrates how Pāṇini was working with a more refined and comprehensive
phonological apparatus as compared with that of the CA.

as an example of the elision of initial a with the transfer of its nasalization to
the eliding e.” The mss. in this case follow the CA prescription, and it is diffi-

अध्याय १, पाद ३

Translation: In the passage puruṣa ā babhūvā̃3 \(AV 10.2.
28\), \[the final vowel of the word babhūva is replaced by a
protracted nasalized vowel\] before the pause.
Note: The expression avasāne is used to restrict this change only to
the pre-pausal environment. Therefore, this change does not take place when
babhūva is combined with iti in the Parihāra which is part of the Krama
recitation. It is not immediately clear whether the rule says anything about
what happens in the Saṃhitā, or applies only negatively in the Krama
recitation. Whitney seems to prefer almost a negative interpretation: “The pada
text reads simply puruṣaḥ : ā : babhūvā̃3 : and there would be no call for such a
rule as that given here, but for the requirements of the krama text, in which
babhūva as the last word in a verse, must suffer parihāra \(iv.117 = CA 4.4.18\),
or repetition with iti interposed, and in which it might be made a question
whether the nasality of the vowel should or should not be preserved before iti.
This rule teaches us that the nasal quality is lost before the iti.” I believe
Whitney’s interpretation is too indirect. The straight forward interpretation is
that the final vowel of the expression पुरु॑ष॒ आ ब॑भू॒व becomes \[prolonged, and\]
nasalized, before a pause. The fact that it remains non-nasal before iti is an
indirect consequence. By mentioning the whole sequence पुरु॑ष॒ आ ब॑भवाँ३, the
CA indicates that this change occurs only in this sequence, and not in every
case of babhūva. 
Whitney’s dilemma arises because of the fact that the Padapāṭha already
has babhūvā̃3, and hence such a rule is not needed either for the Pada text or
the Saṃhitā. However, the CA may not always be proceeding from the Pada
form to Saṃhitā form, but occasionally it seems to proceed from the normal
form, e.g. babhūva to both the Pada and Saṃhitā forms.

Note: Bhārgava-Bhāskara assumes that the word babhūvā̃3 is cited to
refer to the a class of similar examples, and thus the rule also accounts for
similar examples in RV. Or perhaps he means: itiśabdaḥ prakārārthaḥ. In any
case, he wishes to extend the scope of this rule beyond its intention. This
indicates that the late commentators on the Prātiśākhyas were under the
generalizing influence of systems like that of Pāṇini. The rule is originally in-
tended to apply only to the word babhūva as it occurs in the specified context,
and not to any other instance, let alone to other examples in texts like the RV.
१.३.९. ऋवर्णस्य रेफात्परं यत् ।
Whitney \(1.71\). G: 1.3.9.
Translation: \[In becoming nasalized\], for r̥ vowels \[= ∂r∂\],
the \[vocalic\] part following r \[becomes nasal, i.e. ∂r∂̐\].

Note: Commenting upon this rule, Whitney says: “Here we learn that,
when such a vowel is nasalized, the nasal quality does not affect the r, but only
the part of a vowel which follows it. Anyone may perceive, however, upon

अध्याय १, पाद ३
214
trying the experiment, that there is no physical difficulty in the way of
nasalizing the r itself.” Whitney clearly disregards the fact that the entire tradi-
tion of Sanskrit grammar and phonetics is united in declaring that there is no
nasal counterpart for r, as indeed there are for y, v, and l. Thus, there was no
question of nasalizing the r element. However, it was a legitimate question
whether the first vocalic element which precedes the r also becomes nasal. The
question becomes all the more necessary, since, in passages like ऋ॒तूँरुत्सृ॑जते
\(AV 6.36.2\), the consonant r is preceded by a nasal vowel. 
An explanation of why the latter vocalic fraction becomes lengthened or
is nasalized, and not the previous one, may be found in the fact that the vowel r̥
was pronounced in most of the historical period as either ri or ru, and in these
pronunciations, the preceeding vocalic fraction almost went unrepresented, and
the following vocalic fraction was given a more distinct form. From the
present rule, one can infer that the pronunciation of r̥ known to the CA was
closer to ri or ru, and hence the only vowel which could be lengthened or
nasalized was the vowel following the consonantal r. This is also known
indirectly from earlier evidence; i.e., dreśya, see: Wackernagel, I. 31.

1.3.10.
Translation: The u as a monophonic \[morpheme\] is nasal-

Note: The term apr̥kta literally means ‘uncombined.’ However,
P.1.2.41 \(अपृक्त एकाल्प्रत्ययः\) defines it as referring to an affix that consists of a
single sound. In the usage of the CA \(1.3.10, 1.3.17, and 4.4.14\), it refers to
particles which consist of a single vowel. Cf. TPR \(1.54\) and VPR \(1.151\).

Note: Whitney says: “In the pada- text of the Atharvan, as in those of
the other Vedas, the particle u is always written ũ iti.” Bhārgava-Bhāskara on
the other hand informs us that this practice is not followed by some schools
like the Taittirīyas. This is supported by the printed text of the Padapāṭha of the
TS \(e.g. 1.1.4, VSM edn, Vol.I., Pt.I., p 71\).
१.३.११. दीर्घः प्रगृह्यश्च ।
Whitney \(1.73\). E, F: omit the Visarga. G combines this with the
preceding. I: 16.
Translation: \[The monophonic particle u, before the word
iti in the Padapāṭha\] is also lengthened and is treated as a pra-
gr̥hya \[i.e. is not combined in sandhi with the following iti\].
Note: Whitney starts out by saying, “Any satisfactory reason why the
particle u should be treated in this peculiar manner by the framers of the pada-
text is not readily apparent,” but comes up with the most likely explanation: “It
seems as if the protraction must have been made in order to give the word more
substance as an independent pada in the disjoined text, it being the only in-
stance of a single short vowel possessing such a value; and as if the nasaliza-
tion and addition of iti were intended to mark it more distinctly as an excep-
tional case, requiring a different treatment in the saṃhitā-text. Pāṇini \(i.1.17,
18\) allows it to be read either u or ūn̐.” Also see the MB on P.1.1.17 for
problems involved in interpreting Pāṇini’s rules. As Bhārgava-Bhāskara notes
on the previous rule, the Padapāṭha of the Taittirīya-Saṃhitā does not show
lengthening, nasalization, or the addition of the word iti to u.

१.३.१२. ईकारोकारौ च सप्तम्यर्थे ।
Whitney \(1.74\). C, Hb, N: omit च. Hb, Nb: इ for ई. G: 1.3.11.
Translation: \[Word-final\] ī and ū, when the formation has
a locative sense, are also treated as pragr̥hya \[i.e. are not com-
bined in sandhi with the following vowel, e.g. i of iti added
after a pragr̥hya word in the Padapāṭha\].
Note: The significance of this rule, and the rules which follow, lies in
that they offer us some insight into the fact that the Padapāṭha occasionally
gives indications of a syntactic-semantic understanding of the words of the
Saṃhitā. Generally speaking, the Prātiśākhyas do not concern themselves with
matters of syntax, except when such syntactic/semantic matters are explicitly
reflected in the Padapāṭha. Another curious fact may also be noted. The CA
rule, as well as Pāṇini \(1.1.19: ईदूतौ च सप्तम्यर्थे\), treat forms like āṣṭrī and urvī
as being in the sense of a locative \(saptamy-arthe\), rather than being irregular
Vedic locative forms. It is clear that these forms are viewed by the Padapāṭha
as being exceptional forms. Perhaps, after noticing the absence or deletion of
the normal locative affix, there was a certain hesitation to categorize them
clearly as locatives \(saptamī\), though it was clear that the forms had a locative
meaning. Also see: MB on P.1.1.19.
As Whitney notes, in all these instances, these forms are given as
pragr̥hyas in the Padapāṭha, followed by iti. However, that by itself does not
tell us whether the author of the Padapāṭha intended these forms to be duals, or
forms in the locative sense. In any case, the commentators seem to be in fur-
ther disarray. On RV \(9.12.3\), both Venkaṭamādhava and Sāyaṇa paraphrase
the form gaurī with gauryām, and Sāyaṇa says: गौर्यामधि । अधीति सप्तम्यर्थानुवादः.
The AV examples, on the other hand, have been treated rather in an inconsis-
tent way by \[Pseudo\]Sāyaṇa. The form āṣṭrī \(AV 6.27.3\) is simply para-
phrased with the locative āṣṭryāṃ. The form tanū \(AV 4.25.5\) is actually
treated as a locative form, with the locative affix deleted: तन्वाम् । ‘सुपां सुलुक्’
\(पा.७.१.३९\) इति सप्तम्या लुक् । ‘ईदूतौ च सप्तम्यर्थे’ \(पा.१.१.१९\) इति प्रगृह्यसंज्ञा. On
the other hand, the form urvī \(AV 18.1.32\) is taken as an accusative dual and is
paraphrased with urvyau. Even though this does not understand the word in
the locative sense, it at least accounts for why the word is treated as a pragr̥hya
in the Padapāṭha. Finally, the form mahī \(AV 18.1.39\) is taken either as an
irregular accusative singular \(महतीमित्यर्थः । अमः स्थाने सुः\), or it is construed
with vātāḥ in the same verse \(अथ वा महीत्युत्तरत्र वाता इत्यनेन सम्बध्यते\). In either

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका217
case, the explanations do not account for why the word should be treated as a
pragr̥hya by the Padapāṭha.

also note that the CA rule is identical in wording with APR \(63\). This means
that at least for these two texts, the forms concerned are all in the sense of the
locative case. Also note the reading अा॒ष्ट्र्यां प॒दम् ... found in RV \(10.165.3\)

१.३.१३. द्विवचनान्तौ ।
Whitney \(1.75\). G: 1.3.12.
Translation: \[The vowels ī and ū\] occurring as finals of
dual forms \[are also called pragr̥hya\].
Note: The words which are designated as pragr̥hya by this rule are
followed by iti in the Padapāṭha, and are not combined in sandhi with the fol-
lowing vowels either in the Saṃhitā or in the Padapāṭha. While for all the AV
examples for the previous rule, the absence of sandhi can be illustrated only for
Padapāṭha citations, that is not the case for the examples of the present rule.
Here, in a number of cases listed by the CAB, the lack of sandhi is manifest in
the Saṃhitā as well.
Another curious feature may also be noted. By using dual forms īkāro-
kārau in the previous rule, and dvivacanāntau in the present rule, the CA, at
least on the face of it, seems to be designating these sounds, rather than the
words ending in these sounds, by the term pragr̥hya. Interestingly, in this case,
Pāṇini seems to be somewhat inconsistent. P.1.1.19 \(ईदूतौ च सप्तम्यर्थे\) resem-
bles CA \(1.3.12: ईकारोकारौ च सप्तम्यर्थे\). On the other hand, P.1.1.11 \(इदूदेद्
द्विवचनं प्रगृह्यम्\) contrasts with CA \(1.3.13: द्विवचनान्तौ\). In this case, Pāṇini
seems to treat the whole words as pragr̥hyas, while the CA seems to be explic-
itly referring to the final vowels alone.

Note: The last example quoted by Bhārgava-Bhāskara is somewhat
unclear. AV \(4.16.6\) has the passage beginning with ye te. However, the
words ye and te in this instance are not dual forms. They are nominative
plurals agreeing with pāśāḥ. The commentator must have intended dual forms,
as they occur in AV \(4.26.1\). However, here they do not occur consecutively.
Also, these forms are nowhere followed by iti in the mantra \(= saṃhitā\), but
only in the Padapāṭha for AV \(4.26.1\). Thus, it is not clear why Bhārgava-
Bhāskara would cite this example prefixed with the word mantre.

and मे. G: 1.3.14.
Translation: Also \[the\] high-pitch \[sound e occurring at
the end of the forms\] asmé, yuṣmé, tvé, and mé.
Note: Whitney points out: “The specification ‘when accented’ is, of
course, meant only for the two latter of the words named, as the others would
never occur otherwise than accented. Of the four, yuṣmé and mé never occur
in the Atharvan text.” Compare the wording of the verse cited in the CAB
with the wording of APR \(59, p. 53\): एकारो विभक्त्यादेशश्छन्दसीति. Also note
that the examples listed under APR \(59\) cover only tve and asme.  Since those
are the only forms occurring in the ŚAV, one can clearly relate the APR with
the Śaunakīya tradition.  On the other hand, Surya Kanta \(Atharva-Prāti-
śākhya, Introduction, p. 39\) says that the forms yuṣmé and mé do not occur in
the Vulgate of the AV, but suggests that they may have occurred in a genuine
Śaunakīya recension of the AV.
There is a great deal of confusion of readings in the mss. of the AV,
and Whitney points out: “tvé is found once, in a Rik passage \(AV. v.2.3 =
RV. x.120.3\), and also, according to the manuscripts, in viii.9.9, twice re-
peated, and each time written in the pada-text tvé iti, as a pragr̥hya: but the ac-
cent and the addition of iti are hardly to be regarded otherwise than as a blunder
of the tradition, since the word is evidently the enclitic or accentless tva of the
Vedic language: no forms of this enclitic pronoun are found elsewhere in the
Atharvan. The fourth, asmé, is also hardly an Atharvan word. It is found in
three Rik passages, viz. iv.21.1 \(RV. vi.28.1\), xviii.1.3 \(RV. x.10.3\), 42 \(RV.
x.17.8\) : in another passage \(iv.31.3\), where the Rik \(x.84.3\) reads asmé, all
the Atharvan manuscripts have asmai, which has been altered to asmé in the
edition, in obedience to the requirement of the sense, and the authority of the

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका221
Rik reading. Another precisely similar case is xix.40.4 \(RV. i.46.6\). The only
passage where the Atharvan gives asmé independently is v.1.3, where all the
manuscripts except P. and M. \(copies of the same original, by the same scribe\)
agree in reading it \(pada asmé iti\) : here also, however, the edition reads as-
mai.” 
In contrast with Whitney’s views, it should be born in mind that the
APR \(59\) deals with tvé and asmé examples, and therefore the inclusion of
asmé forms under pragr̥hyas was clearly acceptable to both the CA and the
APR. The APR lists AV \(8.9.9\) as a case of accented tvé. In AV \(4.21.1\),
\(18.1.3\), \(18.1.42\), and \(5.1.3\), the APR reads asmé, and its non-inclusion of
AV \(4.31.3\) suggests that it had the reading asmai. In all these listed cases, the
Padapāṭha clearly treats these forms as pragr̥hyas, and adds iti after them.
Thus, it is most likely that Whitney’s choice of readings in these cases is not
only against the mss. of the AV, but also against the authority of the Pada-
pāṭha, and the APR, which was indeed not known to him.
The KV on P.1.1.13 \(शे \) claims that the only Vedic example of one of
these pragr̥hyas listed in this rule being followed by a vowel in the Saṃhitā-
pāṭha is RV \(4.49.4\): अ॒स्मे इ॑न्द्राबृहस्पती.

\(not in Vedic texts\)।
Note: The example amī aśaśre \(not āśaśre as cited by Surya Kanta\)
cited by the CAB is not found in the Vulgate of the AV, and Surya Kanta
\(APR, Introduction, p. 40\) suggests that this may have occurred in the genuine
Śaunakīya recension of the AV, and that the Vulgate is not the genuine
Śaunakīya recension. M.A. Mehendale, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Insti-
tute, Pune, suggests in a personal exchange that if the form aśaśre is read as
āśaśre, this could possibly be an irregular past perfect 3rd plural form of ā-\!śā
\(śiśāti\), similar to the form duhre. In any case, no such form is attested in any
known Vedic text. The form śaśre by itself is attested several times in the AV
as a perfect form in the singular \(e.g. AV 4.8.6; 5.31.11\). This form is derived
by Sāyaṇa from the root śr̥, śr̥ṇāti. 
The counter-example śamyatra cited by the CAB suggests that the
commentator took the expression amī in the rule as not referring to the form
amī, but as referring any expression ending in the sequence amī. Such an in-
terpretation is strengthened by the addition of the condition bahuvacanam in the
rule. Whitney says that the counter-example śamy atra is plainly a fabrication
of the commentator. The same counter-example is also given in the KV on
P.1.1.12 \(अदसो मात्\), though for a different reason. 

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका223
Referring to the addition of the condition bahuvacanam, Whitney says:
“nor can I find that the text contains anything which should render that addition
necessary. The Vāj. Pr. says \(i.98\) ‘amī, when a word by itself;’ the other
treatises \(R. Pr. i.19, r. 19, r. 73, lxxiv; Taitt. Pr. iv. 12\) see no reason for ap-
pending any such limitations.” A possible reason for the inclusion of such a
condition may be that the dividing line between phonology and morphology
could not be clearly conveyed, and hence the author of the CA suspected that a
mere enunciation of the sequence amī could possibly overextend to those cases
where the sequence amī occurred, but not as an independent word. To avert
such a presumed over-extension, the condition bahuvacanam was added.

Note: Bhārgava-Bhāskara makes a desperate attempt to prove the
necessity of the qualification bahuvacanam in the rule by showing that there
can be another expression amī derived from the root am, which is a feminine
nominative singular of a stem in long ī. The qualification bahuvacanam is in-
tended to prevent the application of this rule to such an instance. No such ex-
pression is attested in Sanskrit usage, and it is purely a theoretical creation of
the commentator. The CAB provides a better counter-example in this respect,
i.e. śamī\+atra. This counter-example is also found in the KV on P.1.1.12.
१.३.१७. निपातोऽपृक्तोऽनाकारः ।
Whitney \(1.79\). G: 1.3.16.

अध्याय १, पाद ३
224
Translation: A monophonic particle, except ā, is also pra-
gr̥hya.
Note: P.1.1.41 \(अपृक्त एकाल्प्रत्ययः\) defines the term apr̥kta as applying
to a monophonic affixal element. Since a nipāta ‘particle’ is not an affixal ele-
ment, the term apr̥kta could not be used for a monophonic particle in Pāṇini’s
system. Thus, he was forced to formulate his rule differently, cf. P.1.1.14
\(निपात एकाजनाङ्\). However, the CA use of the term apr̥kta is not constrained
by such a limitation, and hence it could be used to qualify a particle. While
practically, all the elements qualified by the term apr̥kta in the CA are particles
consisting of a single vowel, it is not clear whether one should translate the
term as ‘consisting of an uncombined vowel,’ as done by Whitney. 
Whitney clearly perceives that the particle o illustrated by the examples
cited in the CAB is ‘composed of ā and u.’ This is made explicit by Bhārgava-
Bhāskara. However, it would seem to me that the author of the Padapāṭha and
the author of the CA probably did not treat it that way, but perceived it as a
single particle, which needed a separate treatment. 
Whitney, however, does have a point: “The form of this rule is not a
little strange : why o should thus be made an exception from the next rule, and
why, when there is no other particle, except ā, composed of a single vowel, it
should be treated as if one of a class, it is very difficult to see : we cannot help
suspecting here the influence of the general grammar : compare Pāṇ. i.1.14, the
virtual correspondence of which with our rule is as close as possible.” It
seems clear that Pāṇini had a larger class of monophonic particles in his mind.
Bhārgava-Bhāskara cites such Pāṇinian examples, which are, of course, not at-
tested in the text of the AV.

Note: Compare the terminology used by the CAB and the commen-
tary of Bhārgava-Bhāskara. While the first uses the sūtra term anākāraḥ, the
latter replaces it with anāṅ, a usage from Pāṇini \(1.1.14: निपात एकाजनाङ्\). It
also replaces the term ukāra of CA 1.3.11-12 with the Pāṇinian term uñ, cf.
P.1.1.17-18 \(उञः, ऊँ\). This shows how Bhārgava-Bhāskara is fully utilizing,
and taking for granted, the terminology of the Pāṇinian grammar. By offering
examples, which are not specifically Atharvan, and which are commonplace in
Pāṇinian commentaries, he is in effect offering a Pāṇinian interpretation of this
Prātiśākhya. The examples इ इन्द्रः and उ उमेशः are found in the Siddhānta-
Kaumudī on P.1.1.14 \(निपात एकाजनाङ्\). We also find there the instances आ एवं
नु मन्यसे and आ एवं किल तत्. 
१.३.१८. ओकारान्तश्च ।
Whitney \(1.80\). G: 1.3.17.
Translation: Also \[a polyphonic particle\] ending in o \[is
pragr̥hya\].
Note: Whitney raises an important concern regarding the notion of a
particle ending in o as understood in this rule: “This is a strangely inaccurate
description: it was bad enough to have the upasarga or preposition ā treated as
a nipāta by the last rule, when combined with u : but here we have nouns,
verbs, prepositions, and particles all confounded together under the same name.
... In the form of the rule is perhaps to be seen again the influence of the gen-
eral grammar : compare Pāṇ. i.1.14.” What Whitney fails to point out is that in
all these cases, the final o is arrived at by a combination of a word with the

अध्याय १, पाद ३
226
following particle u, and yet this combination is treated by the Padapāṭha as an
indivisible combination, making the combined form a nipātānta, if not strictly a
nipāta, cf. Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary. 
One also needs to comment on Whitney’s statement: “it was bad
enough to have the upasarga or preposition ā treated as a nipāta by the last
rule.” This statement assumes that nipāta and upasarga refer to exclusive
classes. Such an impression could have been created perhaps by the statement
in the Nirukta \(1.12\) which lists nāma, ākhyāta, upasarga, and nipāta as four
classes of words. However, this is clearly not the only treatment of these two
categories. Pāṇini \(1.4.56, 58, 59\) considers upasarga and nipāta as overlap-
ping categories, with the latter subsuming the former, cf. गत्युपसर्गकर्मप्रवचनीय-
संज्ञाभिः सह निपातसंज्ञा समाविशति, KV on P.1.4.56 \(प्राग्रीश्वरान्निपाताः\). Also see:

times\), uto \(7 times\), and iho, yado, aṅgo, evo, doṣo \(once each\); but of
prepositions we have o and upo \(twice each\), and pro \(once\); of verbs,
vidmo, datto, atto \(once each\); and of nouns \(pronouns\), teno \(twice\), yo and
so \(once each\).” Bhārgava-Bhāskara lists additional non-AV forms.
१.३.१९. आमन्त्रितं चेतावनार्षे ।
Whitney \(1.81\). G: 1.3.18. Ha, Na: °र्थे for °र्षे.
Translation: A vocative form, \[ending in o\], is also \[pra-
gr̥hya\], before an iti which is not a part of the Saṃhitā text \[lit.
which does not come from the ancient seers who ‘saw’ the
Vedic saṃhitās\].
Note: The present CA rule corresponds to P.1.1.16 \(सम्बुद्धौ शाकल्यस्ये-
तावनार्षे\), where this doctrine is ascribed to Śākalya. The rule raises some inter-
esting questions and Whitney has brought out some of these: “The vocatives in
o, from themes in u, are not in a single instance treated as pragr̥hyas in the
saṃhitā of the Atharvan, but are always euphonically combined with the fol-
lowing vowel. In the pada-text, however, they are invariably written as if they
were pragr̥hyas, with the usual iti annexed. The object of this rule, then, is to
teach that they are exempt from euphonic combination only in the pada-text,
while in other situations they are to be treated according to the general euphonic
rules.” This sounds good enough. The CAB, raising the question इताविति
किमर्थम्, says that before words other than iti, the vocative forms in o are not
pragr̥hyas. On the other hand, Bhārgava-Bhāskara raises the question anārṣe
iti kim. This is answered by pointing out that before an iti of the saṃhitā-text,
the vocative in o is not treated as a pragr̥hya. Of course the example he offers
is not from the Atharvan text, but it is a Vedic example nonetheless.

अध्याय १, पाद ३
228
Whitney questions: “This whole state of things is something very
peculiar. Why, when the o of vāyo is really no more exempt from change than
the e of agne, should it be regarded by all the pada-texts as a pragr̥hya, causing
so much trouble to the different treatises to explain its treatment?” This may
possibly suggest dialect differences among the Padakāras, see Cardona \(1991\).

१.३.२०. आर्त्नी इवादिष्विवादितिपरः ।
Whitney \(1.82\): °दितिः परः. G: 1.3.19. I: 20.
Translation: In \[passages such as\] ārtnī iva \(AV 1.1.3\), \[in
the pada-text\], the word iti follows \[the word iva, rather than
the strictly pragr̥hya word ārtnī etc.\].
Note: The peculiarity of this formation needs to be clearly under-
stood. The Vedic exegetical tradition almost unanimously agrees that the word
iva is compounded with the preceding word. Given this notion, how should
one deal with forms like ārtnī before iva? Here, Bhārgava-Bhāskara states
clearly that there is no sandhi between such pragr̥hya words as ārtnī with the
following iva, i.e. there is a pragr̥hya inside a compound expression. How-
ever, the pada-text marks the pragr̥hya character by adding an iti after the com-
pound expression ending in iva.
Whitney points out that the pada-text of the AV actually reads ārtnī
ivety ārtnī ’iva, but the commentary CAB records only the first portion ārtnī
iveti, and leaves out the repetition of the compound.

after the pragr̥hya word, and not after the word iva. This is illustrated, for in-
stance, by the example वाससी इव \(TS 1.5.10\). Here, the dual word vāsasī is a
pragr̥hya and is followed by the word iva in the Saṃhitā. However, the Pada-
text goes: वास॑सी॒ इति॑ । इ॒व॒. In view of the example from the TS, and its dis-
tinctive practice mentioned by Bhārgava-Bhāskara, we need to modify
Whitney’s belief that the doctrine enunciated by the present rule was “adopted
by all the pada-texts.”
१.३.२१. अनुनासिकोऽन्तःपदे ह्रस्वः ।
Whitney \(1.83\). G: 1.3.20. Most mss. read rhasvaḥ.
Translation: A nasal \[vowel\] occurring in the interior of a
word \[i.e. in the non-final position\] is \[as a general rule\]
short.
Note: Whitney thinks that the doctrine taught by this rule and its ex-
ceptions does not enter into the proper province of a Prātiśākhya. However, he
commends Uvaṭa on the RPR who “is at much pains to explain its introduction
into the Prātiśākhya, into whose proper province such a matter does not enter.”
Whitney then explains the “little inconsistencies and redundancies of this kind,
which are exhibited by all the treatises; they aid in the general purpose of a
Prātiśākhya, which is to preserve the traditional text of the school from corrup-
tion.” Whitney’s discussion has a built-in circularity, though I do not disagree
with his final conclusion.
It must be pointed out again that this treatise does not distinguish
between anusvāra and anunāsika. Therefore, the point of the rule is not to say
that such a vowel as discussed here is a nasal vowel, instead of being a pure
vowel followed by an anusvāra. The point of the discussion is that it is a short
vowel. However, note that according to this text, cf. CA \(1.2.13: अनुनासिकं च\),

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका231
every nasal vowel is metrically treated as a heavy \(guru\) vowel / syllable. This
removes the possible metrical difference between a short nasal vowel, and a
short pure vowel followed by an anusvāra.

nasal vowels, in general, are short. Again it should be kept in mind that the
CA does not differentiate between a nasal vowel and a pure vowel followed by
an anusvāra.

Whitney \(1.85\). E \(orig\), F, G: पाँशुमाँसा°. G and F \(corr\) add उ at the

Translation: \[Also, the nasal vowels\] of the words pāṃsu
\(= pā̃su\), māṃsa \(= mā̃sa\) etc. \[are long\].
Note: The mss. do not consistently distinguish between a nasal vowel
from an anusvāra, nor does the CA make any clear distinction. Thus, as
before, the main point of this rule is that these nasal vowels are long, and not to
contrast between a nasal vowel versus a pure vowel followed by an anusvāra.

Note: Concerning the reading śāṃśayena for AV \(6.129.1\),
Whitney’s note on this rule hesitantly asks us to correct the form to śāṃśapena
: “should be śāṃśapena? the manuscripts blunder somewhat over the word, but
W.E. and H. read distinctly śāṃśapena.” This hesitation is gone in his note to
the translation of this verse \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p.378\): “The mss. blunder
over the word śāṃśapéna. SPP. reports only śāṃśaphéna as variant \(read by
two of his\); ours have that, and also śāṃsayéna and sāṃśayéna; our text reads
wrongly śāṃśayéna \#correct to śāṃśapéna∃.” The VVRI edition finally
chooses śāṃśapéna, and I have followed that reading. However, the mss. of
the CAB probably intended -yena. This is also the reading of the APR \(p.
150\).

Note: The two commentaries show that they seriously commented on
two different readings. It would seem that an original reading pā̃su was first
corrupted to pā̃śu, and then a few manuscripts further changed it to upā̃śu.
These two readings are restricted to those manuscripts which call the CA either
Caturādhyāyī-Vyākaraṇa, or Kautsa-Vyākaraṇa, and thus share a common
branching.
१.३.२४. हनिगम्योः सनि ।
Whitney \(1.86\). C, Hb, J, Nab, P: °सनिः. Ha: °सतिः. G: 1.3.23.
Translation: \[The nasal vowel is long also\] in the desidera-
tive forms of the roots han and gam \[lit. the nasal vowel of
the roots han and gam, when followed by the desiderative af-
fix san, is long\].
Note: One needs to assume that when there is a reduplication of the
root, the first occurrence is treated as the reduplication, while the second
occurrence is treated as the original root. 
As Whitney notes, there is no desiderative form of gam found in the
present text of the AV, unless we decide to amend य॒दा स्थाम॒ जिघँा॑सति \(AV
12.4.29-30\) to जिगांसति on the basis of the present rule. No manuscript of the
AV supports this emendation. However, note that Bhārgava-Bhāskara seems
to cite the form jigā̃sati, besides jighā̃sati. In all probability, this is simply to
illustrate the two roots given in the rule, and need not truly suggest that the text
of the AV as known to Bhārgava-Bhāskara had the form jigā̃sati. 
Secondly, it is interesting to note the use of san in this text where the n
is identical with the metalinguistic marker n in Pāṇini’s desiderative affix san.
The CA simply takes this marker for granted, and does not define its function

अध्याय १, पाद ३
234
as Pāṇini does, cf. P.6.4.16 \(अज्झनगमां सनि\). This may possibly indicate a post-
Pāṇinian layer in the CA, but one cannot be certain.
Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 39\) suggests that the currently
available Vulgate of the AV is not a genuinely Śaunakīya version, and that a
genuinely Śaunakīya AV may have contained the desiderative of gam.

१.३.२५. शान्मान्दानाम् ।
Whitney \(1.87\). G: 1.3.24.
Translation: \[Also, the nasal vowel in the desiderative
forms of the roots\] śān, mān, and dān \[is long\].
Note: Of the three listed roots, only the forms of mān occur in the
available text of the ŚAV. Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 39\) suggests
that desiderative forms of śān and dān may have actually occurred in a genu-
inely Śaunakīya recension of the AV, which the currently available Vulgate is
not. Whitney points out that P.3.1.6 \(मान्बधदान्शान्भ्यो दीर्घश्चाभ्यासस्य\) also groups
these three roots together, besides the root badh, and suggests that a similar
occasional urge to indulge in the provisions for a general grammar of Sanskrit
may account for several rules in the CA. Whitney’s suggestion does have
some merit, and that one need not posit, like Surya Kanta, the existence of a so-
called true Śaunakīya recension of the AV which supposedly contained all
these untraceable forms.

perfect participial affix\] vasU \[is long\].
Note: The inclusion of the nominative singular form in this rule is
somewhat intriguing, because such a form ends in n, e.g. pareyivān, and has
neither a nasal vowel, nor a pure vowel followed by an anusvāra. Perhaps, the
author of the rule has in his view examples like śuśruvā̃ \(< śuśruvān\) found in
RV \(10.71.5d\).

‘दा॒श्वांस॑म्’ \(अ.वे. ७.४०.२\)।
Note: The last comment of Bhārgava-Bhāskara is somewhat intrigu-
ing. What does he mean in saying that this long nasal vowel does not occur in
some instances? His example दा॒श्वांस॑म् might make sense perhaps if we assume
that he makes a distinction between forms which have a nasal vowel versus
those which have a pure vowel followed by an anusvāra. Such a distinction is
not assumed by the rules of the CA, and the mss. of the AV do not show any
such distinction. If Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s comment is taken seriously, it may
suggest changes which occurred in certain oral traditions.
The CA rule itself uses the expression vasu for the affix vas. The final
u must be a marker sound, as the same marker is found in Pāṇini. Pāṇini adds
one more marker, making the affix vas appear as KvasU, cf. P.3.2.107
\(क्वसुश्च\). Bhārgava-Bhāskara uses the expression KvasU, even though the CA
uses only vasU, thus indicating an advanced degree of Pāṇinianization of this
tradition.

Whitney \(1.89\). A, Hb, Nbc, O: इ for ई. A, B, D: °शश्च for °सश्च.

\(अ.वे. १७.१.१-५\)।
Note: Again notice that the CA and the CAB refer to the affix as īyas,
but Bhārgava-Bhāskara uses the Pāṇinian term īyasUN. This is an indication
of an advanced stage of Pāṇinianization of this tradition.
१.३.२८. विदेश्च ।
Whitney \(1.90\). G: 1.3.26. O: विदेश्चः.  G, I: comes before ईयसश्च. I:
ईयसश्च२ विदेश्च१.
Translation: Also, \[the nasal vowel appearing in the first
five case forms i.e. nominative sg., du., and pl., and accusa-
tive sg. and du.\] of the root vid \[ending in the perfect parti-
cipial affix vasU is long\].
Note: As Whitney notes, Pāṇini treats the formation vid\+vas as an
exceptional case of a present participle, cf. P.7.1.36 \(विदेः शतुर्वसुः\), where the
perfect participle affix vas is used for a present participle. Whitney raises two
appropriate objections: “There are two damaging objections to be made to this
rule : in the first place, it ought to be brought in, if at all, after rule 88 \(= CA
1.3.26\), in order that vasvantasya as well as pañcapadyām may be implied in it
by inference from its predecessor; and in the second place, there is no need of
any such precept at all, since there is no good reason why vidvān, the word to
which it alone applies, should not be considered a vasvanta, and therefore re-
garded as disposed of by rule 88.” Whitney’s concern about rule ordering was
apparently felt by a few copyists as well, and therefore we have two manu-
scripts, G and I, which invert the order of CA 1.3.27-28, and place this rule
immediately after CA 1.3.26 \(= W 1.88\). Unfortunately, the manuscript evi-
dence is overwhelmingly against this inversion. No manuscript omits this rule
either. Just looking at the textual evidence, one must say that the author of the

अध्याय १, पाद ३
238
CA could not lump the forms of vidvas together with the perfect participle
forms like those of pareyivas, and in this separation he had reasons similar to
Pāṇini’s.

Note: Bhārgava-Bhāskara tries to extend this rule beyond the forms
of vid, by overinterpreting ca to mean that the rule applies to other cases of vas,
such as the affix vas as a possessive affix. This is done in order to account for
the form भ॒क्ति॒वाँसः॑ \(AV 6.79.3\). It is not clear if this form could be taken care
of by CA \(1.3.26\). But, then, the forms of vidvas can as well be taken care of
by that rule.

Note: Both the commentaries raise the question: why have the con-
dition pañcapadyām? The simple answer is that the rule should not apply
beyond the five forms referred to by pañcapadī, i.e. the first five forms of the
nominal paradigm. Again, we must keep in mind that the intended contrast
between the forms pumā̃sam and pũsi is only as regards the length of the nasal
vowel, and not that one form is with a nasal vowel, while the other should be
with a pure vowel followed by an anusvāra. Such a distinction is not made by
this text, and it is only our orthography which forces us to be over-specific. 
Also, Bhārgava-Bhāskara over-interprets this rule to extend it to cases
of taddhita formations like paũsnya. This word is attested in AV \(20.73.6\) and
was possibly not in the AV as known to the author of the CA. Whitney has
made a justifiable argument that the CA is familiar with only the first 18 books
of the ŚAV, and that the last two books are a later addition.

Whitney \(1.92\). G: 1.4.1.
Translation: The sound which precedes the final sound \[i.e.
the penultimate sound\] is termed upadhā.
Note: Whitney points out that this definition of upadhā is ‘precisely
the same’ as the definition in the VPR \(i.35\), but further says: “In the Rik Pr.
the word has a more general use, as ‘preceding letter or word’ \(upa-dhā, ‘a
setting against or next to’\): it is probably on account of this less restricted
signification current in some schools that the two treatises first spoken of deem
it necessary to limit the term by a specific definition.” Also see Renou \(1942:
395-6\). P.1.1.65 \(अलोऽन्त्यात् पूर्व उपधा\) is also identical with the present CA
rule. One may speculate that Pāṇini’s wording is based on something similar
to the wording of the CA, in that the masculine form pūrvaḥ in Pāṇini’s rule
seems to have the assumed masculine qualificand varṇa \(= aL\).

CAB cites two rules from the CA which make use of this term. On the other
hand, Bhārgava-Bhāskara alludes to P.8.2.9 \(मादुपधायाश्च मतोर्वोऽयवादिभ्यः\)
which uses this same term. However, this rule teaches where the possessive
affix -matUP changes to -vatUP. There is no such rule in the CA. To say that
the Prātiśākhya defines the term upadhā so that it may used in rules similar to
P.8.2.9 is absurd. However, this only goes to show how the Pāṇinian
tradition has been internalized by this commentator, so that he almost fails to
recognize that the CA is not part of this tradition. 
The examples अग्निरत्र and वायुरत्र provided by the CAB are found in the
KV on P.8.2.66 \(ससजुषो रुः\). 
१.४.२. स्वरोऽक्षरम् ।
Whitney \(1.93\). G: 1.4.2.
Translation: A vowel is called a syllable.
Note: Whitney comments: “The precise scope of this rule it is not
easy to determine; it seems to be rather a general and theoretic doctrine than a
precept which enters in any active and practical manner into the system of rules
of our treatise. ... We may perhaps regard our rule as a virtual precept that the
accentuation, which in later rules \(iii.55 = CA 3.3.1 etc.\) is taught especially to
the vowels, extends its sway over the whole syllable : or, on the other hand,
that the accents, which in rules 14-16 \(= CA 1.1.16\) above were declared to
belong to syllables, affect especially the vowels. With the subject of accent the
commentator seems, at any rate, to bring it into special connection.” Addition-
ally, one may perhaps connect this rule with the metrical notion of syllable,
where the number of syllables is basically identical with the number of vowels.
The term akṣara in the sense of a metrical syllable is historically attested all the
way from the oldest stratum of the Vedic literature. Also cf. VPR \(1.99\).

Note: The CAB here quotes CA 3.3.31-34 to illustrate the use of the
term akṣara just as it has quoted two CA rules on the previous sūtra to illustrate
the term upadhā. These rules were not admitted by Whitney as being part of
the text of the CA. All the manuscripts contain these rules, and now it is clear
that even the CAB, the oldest commentary on this text, admits them as sūtras
belonging to the CA. At the same time, it is a puzzle as to why the CAB does
not directly comment on these rules.
Whitney, who treated the cited passages as belonging to the commen-
tary, rather than to the text of the CA, yet offered a translation, ‘though not
without some misgivings,’: “what part of a circumflexed syllable is circum-
flexed? Some say, half a short one, quarter of a long one : Śāṅkhamitri says,
the whole : here is found no rule for a syllable \[hrasva and dīrgha are said of
vowels only, see note to r. 51 above\]; since, in each case, the vowel alone is
contemplated \[??\] : now the vowel is declared to be the syllable.” Whitney
notes that his manuscript has the reading शाङ्खमित्रः in this place, though else-
where \(CA 2.1.6 and 3.3.30\) the reading is शाङ्खमित्रिः, and hence in his transla-
tion, he selects the latter. This choice is now supported by the second manu-
script, N. 
Given the confirmed reading अक्षरस्यैषा, the next unclear portion can be
confidently reconstructed as विधा न विद्यते, यद् द्विस्वरीभावः, and can be translated
as: “It is not the norm of a syllable to have two accents \[within one and the
same syllable\].” This seems be the continuation of Śāṅkhamitri’s doctrine that
the whole, and not part of a syllable, is circumflexed.
Also for some reason, Whitney says about the commentary: “Omitting
his usual explanatory paraphrase \(a small loss : it would doubtless have been
svaro ’kṣaram bhavati\), he proceeds at once to give an exposition, of which a
part occurs again at the close of the third section of the third chapter.” This is
inaccurate. Both the manuscripts of the commentary CAB contain the initial
phrase: स्वरः अक्षरसंज्ञं भवति. This paraphrase is also found in the lone manu-
script H, which was available to Whitney, but for some reason, he missed it
while reading or copying it.

Translation: Before an aspirated stop, the preceding

Note: As Whitney correctly points out: “The proper application of
this rule, within the sphere of the Prātiśākhya, is only to cases of the doubling
of the first or second consonants of a group, by the varṇakrama, as taught in
rules iii.26 \(= CA 3.2.1\) etc., yet its form of statement is general, and there can
be no doubt that it should apply to all cases arising in the course of derivation
and inflection, and that forms such as mr̥ḍhḍhi, containing a double lingual so-
nant aspirate, are strictly excluded by it.” Whitney then points out that such

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका245
double aspirates occur in all manuscripts of Vedic texts, and he gives a list of
occurrences in the text of the AV. He corrected all of these in accordance with
the precept taught in the present rule.

Note: The manuscripts of the AV generally do not show the forms
iddhmam, ruruddhre, daddhre, nicakkhnuḥ. We find only the forms idhmam
rurudhre, dadhre, and nicakhnuḥ. Thus, it would seem that while the doctrines
laid down in the CA refer to oral traditions, the orthography of the manuscripts
of the AV reflects a choice of not carrying out these doublings. Even the
manuscripts of the commentaries on the CA do not show the doubling in the
very examples cited to illustrate this phenomenon. As far as manuscripts of the
commentary are concerned, they do not properly indicate the sequence of a
non-aspirate followed by the aspirate. In most cases, the preceding non-aspi-
rate is not shown in writing. For example, the mss. offer the example idhmam.
Written in this fashion, it does not illustrate the operation of the present rule.
What is assumed is that the dh in idhmam undergoes doubling giving us the
stage idhdhmam, which is then reduced to iddhmam by the present rule. Thus,
the intended citation must be iddhmam. The remaining citation forms as
intended must be ruruddhre, daddhre, and nicakkhnuḥ. Only in the case of
dugdham, one need not posit dugddham. This, is because the form dugdham
can be properly thought of as having been derived from dugh\+dha, cf. P.8.2.32
\(दादेर्धातोर्घः\), where the sound gh is reduced to g by the present rule. For a dis-
cussion on the reading rurudhre, see Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p. 202\).

placed items\].

Note: After pointing out the fact that the commentator cites three CA
rules where this term is used, Whitney further observes: “There are other rules
to which the present precept applies; so, in explaining the one next preceding, it
may be looked upon as determining the non-aspirate into which the duplication
of an aspirate is converted to be surd or sonant according as the aspirate is surd
or sonant \(a matter which, in the other treatises, is expressly prescribed in the
rules themselves, and not left for inference\) : and possibly its bearing upon that
rule is the reason why it is introduced here, rather than elsewhere in the treatise.
Similar prescriptions are found in the Rik Pr. \(i.14, r.56, lvii\) and the Vāj. Pr.
\(i.142\).” This procedure is also very close to P.1.1.50 \(स्थानेऽन्तरतमः\).
The commentary supports the view that the replacement of vowels by
semi-vowels occurs, not on the basis of the principle of one-to-one replacement
or yathāsaṃkhya ‘one-to-one substitution for identically numbered substitutes
and originals,’ but on the basis of maximal featural proximity or āntaratamya.
For recent discussions on this issue relating to the interpretation of Pāṇini’s
rule इको यणचि \(P.6.1.77\), see: Deshpande \(1981\), Cardona \(1980-81\), and
Hueckstedt \(1995\). The examples cited here are all made-up examples and are

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका247
not citations from the Atharvan text. The examples दध्यत्र and मध्वत्र occur in the
KV on P.6.1.77. The example वृक्षश्छादयति is found in the KV on P.8.4.40 \(स्तोः

१.४.५. खण्व॒खा३इ॒ खैम॒खा३इ॒ इत्याकारादिकारोऽनुदात्तः ।
Whitney \(1.96\), F, I: इ after खैमखा ३. O: °इत्यका कौ. व्या. रादिकारो-
नुदात्तः.
Translation: In the forms kháṇvakhā́3i and kháimakhā́3i
\(both from AV 4.15.15\), \[in the pluta \(protracted\) vowel, i.e.
ā́3i\], the i following the ā́\[3\] is unaccented.
Note: There is a good deal of confusion regarding the accentuation of
these forms in the manuscripts and the editions of the ŚAV. As Whitney
\(1862: 62, footnote\) points out: “E. I. and H. read the first word khaṇvakhā́3i,
with a single accent only, and the printed text \[i.e. the text of the Whitney-Roth
edition of the AV : ख॒ण्व॒खाइ॒ खैम॒खाइ॒ मध्ये॑ तदुरि\] has, wrongly, as it seems to
me - followed their authority instead of that of the other manuscripts : and also,
by some inexplicable oversight, signs of accent have become attached to the
pluti figures, as if the preceding ā-s were circumflex, and the following i-s ac-
cute. The line ought to read as follows: खण्व॒खा३इ॒ खैम॒खा३इ॒ मध्ये॑ तदुरि.” The
VVRI edition follows Whitney’s corrected reading, while noting other deviant
accentuations in the footnote. This reading shows that these two words contain
two accented syllables each. The initial syllables of these words have the deri-
vational or lexical udātta accent, while the pluta ā́3 gets the prosodic udātta
accent which does not override the former. Other examples with dual udātta
syllables are found in the Vedic literature: yajñápatā́3u, TS 6.6.2.3; súślokā́3ṃ
súmaṅgalā́3ṃ, TS 1.8.16.2; úpahūtā́3m, TS 2.6.7.3; ágnā́3 íti, TS 6.5.8.4;
juhávānī́3, TS 6.5.9.1; páśavā́3, MS 1.8.2; utsŕ̥jyā́3m, TS 7.5.7.1; bahávā́3 íti,
ŚB 10.5.2.16; kúmārā́3, ŚB 14.9.1.1. Cf. Wackernagel and Debrunner \(1896-
1954\), I: 298-99; DelbrÜck \(1888: 552-553\); and Strunk \(1983: 70, 99\).
Some of the Padapāṭha manuscripts, as noted in the VVRI edition,
offer the following readings: ख॒ण्व॒खा३इ॑ । खै॒म॒खा३इ॑ । Such pada readings
probably represent the hyper-corrected accentuation, on the basis of the as-
sumed general rule that a word should have no more than one udātta syllable.
Even the Whitney-Roth edition of the AV seems to have been based on this
impression, and overlooked the exceptional nature of the pluta accent, which
does not seem to override the lexical or derivational accent of the word. As
noted above, Whitney did correct his error later. His Index Verborum to the

248अध्याय १, पाद ४
AV offers the corrected readings with dual udāttas.  The corrected readings are
followed by Wackernagel and Debrunner \(1896-1954\), Vol.I., p. 298.
For additional discussion of these examples, see Note on CA \(1.1.41\).

Translation: In the \[instances\] ávaśā3 \(AV 12.4.42\) and ā́
babhūvā̃3 \(AV 10.2.28\), when followed by iti, the e \[resulting
through the combination of ā́3\+i\] is not protracted.
Note: As Whitney accurately notes, these two examples are some-
what different from each other in the circumstances of this euphonic combina-
tion. In the first case, the word ávaśā3 is followed by íti in the text of the
Saṃhitā itself which reads ávaśéti. But, the Padapāṭha offers the two padas as:
ávaśā3 / íti /, with the first word ending in the pluta vowel. 
Regarding this first example, Whitney comments: “All the saṃhitā
manuscripts, however, observe the precept of our treatise in making the combi-
nation of avaśā3 with the succeeding word, and accordingly its protraction,
which is assured by this rule and by i.105 \(= CA 1.4.14\), and which is exhib-
ited by the pada-text, entirely disappears in saṃhitā - a strange imperfection of
the latter text, and one which, if it did not exhibit itself in all the manuscripts,
we should be very loth to introduce, upon the sole authority of this rule of the
Prātiśākhya.” Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.II., p. 699\) says: “The more proper
reading in b \(in AV 12.4.42\) would seem to be ávaśā́3íti, but all the saṃhitā-
mss. read ávaśé’ti, as in our text, although the pada gives the sign of protrac-
tion \(3\) also after avaśā, as it should be. But the Prāt. \(i.97 = CA 1.4.6\) re-
quires -śé’ti simply: see the rules i.97 \(= CA 1.4.6\) and 105 \(= CA 1.4.14\),
and notes to them.”
Whitney’s doubts whether this rule should apply to the Saṃhitāpāṭha
are strengthened by P.6.1.129 \(अप्लुतवदुपस्थिते\). The rule teaches something

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका249
similar to the present CA rule, except that the word upasthita is interpreted by
Patañjali on this rule as अनार्षः इतिकरणः, “the word iti which does not stem from
a Rṣi \(= Saṃhitāpāṭha\),” i.e. the word iti which appears in the Pada, Krama,
etc. This would suggest that the rule did not apply to the Saṃhitāpāṭha.
However, as Whitney points out, all the manuscripts of the AV exhibit the
saṃhitā form ávaśéti, and hence we must accept that reading. Interestingly,
even the Paippalāda \(17.20.2, Raghuvir edn.\) reading agrees with the
Śaunakīya reading in this case. Thus, the assumption that the word avaśā3
ends in a pluta vowel is not directly based on the Saṃhitāpāṭha, but on the un-
derstanding of the text as exhibited by the author of the AV Padapāṭha, an un-
derstanding which is in close agreement with the precepts of Pāṇini, cf.
P.8.2.97 \(विचार्यमाणानाम्\). Also see Strunk \(1983: 67, 81-82, 97\).
In the second case, the word babhūvā̃3 ending in the pluta vowel al-
ready appears in the Saṃhitā, and it is not followed by íti, either in the Saṃhitā
or in the Padapāṭha. Such a combination arises only in the Kramapāṭha : ब॒भवेति॑

Note: Here, Bhārgava-Bhāskara displays his expertise in the Pāṇinian
system by quoting a number of Pāṇinian rules. Of course, building a Pāṇinian
argument to account for the divergent pronunciations of jña is nothing but an
exercise in futility. Also this whole discussion has little relevance to the
context of the Prātiśākhya rule.
१.४.८. समानपदेऽनुत्तमात्स्पर्शादुत्तमे यमैर्यथासंख्यम् ।
Whitney \(1.99\). A, B \(corr\), Nb: °नुत्तमास्पर्शा°. G: 1.4.8.
Translation: Within the same word, after \[a stop\], other than
the last \[member of a stop series, i.e. after a non-nasal stop\], its
numerically corresponding twin \[yama = nasalized version of
the stop\] is \[inserted\], before a last \[member of a stop series, i.e.
nasal stop\].
Note: Here, the distinctive notion is that of a different principle of
selection for the insertion, i.e. the principle of numerical correspondence
\(yathāsaṃkhya\). This is the same principle which is enunciated in P.1.3.10
\(यथासंख्यमनुदेशः समानाम्\). The idea is as follows. For the set of four non-last
stops in each series of stops, e.g. k, kh, g, and gh, there is a corresponding set
of four nasalized twins or yamas, e.g. k̐, kh̐, g̐, gh̐. The insertion of these
yamas takes place in accordance with their numerical correspondence, e.g. after
k, we can insert only k̐, and not any other yama.
On this rule, Whitney has a long note discussing the notion of yama,
and the core of Whitney’s analysis is as follows: “If, now, we pronounce a t
before a following m, as in ātma, the t, in the first place, suffers abhinidhāna,
losing the explosion which is essential to its full utterance : the organs pass,
without intervening unclosure, from the dental contact to the labial contact, by
which latter the m is produced, with expulsion of sound through the nose. ...
But if we utter sound through the nose before transferring the organs from the
dental to the labial contact, we give origin to a kind of nasal counterpart to the t,
as a transition sound from it to the m. If this is not the yama of the Hindu

252अध्याय १, पाद ४
grammarians, I am utterly at a loss to conjecture what the latter sound should
be. The theory which recognizes it might be compared with that which, in rule
50 \(= CA 1.2.10\), above, taught a general assimilation of the former consonant
of a group, in its final portion, to the latter; it is still more nearly analogous with
the surd which, by ii. 9 \(= CA 2.1.9\), is inserted between a final nasal and a
following sibilant : this arises, like the yama, by an exchange of the emission
\(the anupradāna\) belonging to the former letter for that belonging to the latter
before the transfer of the organs from the one position to the other; and the t
thus introduced, for example, between a n and a s has just as good a right to be
called the yama or counterpart of the former letter, as has the n inserted after t
before m.” 
On the whole, Whitney’s account is substantially accurate, except that
his valuation of the contribution of the Indian phoneticians was not without
hesitation. On the other hand, Max MÜller and Regnier, who held the Indian
phoneticians in high esteem, wrongly believed the yama to be a nasal articula-
tion preceding the stop. For a review, see: Allen \(1953: 75-7\).
Whitney also mentions the two dominant views on yama found in the
Sanskrit phonetic texts: “The ancient commentators themselves seem to have
been somewhat in doubt as to how many different yamas there are, whether
twenty, one for each of the non-nasal mutes, or a smaller number. The
orthodox doctrine of the Rik Pr. seems to be that of twenty : but its commen-
tator says that there are only four; one for all the first mutes, one for all the sec-
onds, and so on.” Rightly calling the second alternative indefensible, Whitney
also has an important criticism of the first alternative: “Physically, it would
seem necessary that a nasal transition sound between two mutes should be of
the nature either of the first or of the second : if the second, and that second a
nasal, it would be indistinguishable from it; of the first, it would be identical
with the nasal of that series, and so the same for all the mutes of the series.”
Another question raised by Whitney relates to the possibility of a yama
after an aspirated stop: “A much more serious difficulty is, that the theory of
the yama allows its occurrence between an aspirate mute and a nasal : and we
should suppose that the unclosure and brief emission of unintonated breath
constituting the aspiration would form an impassable barrier between the two
letters, the nasal utterance being unable to precede it, and the position of contact
of the former letter to follow it, so that no nasal counterpart to the former letter
could be uttered. I see no way of getting over this difficulty, excepting by sup-
posing an inaccuracy in the analysis of the Hindu phonetists.” As is now
shown by Allen \(1953: 176-7\), the two processes of breath and nasality may
overlap, whether partially or wholly, and that this was the case with Sanskrit.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका253
One should also note that Whitney did not admit the possibility of voiced aspi-
ration, and that modern phonetics clearly admits voiced aspiration or breathy
voice.
In spite of some of these valid doubts, Whitney is correct in assuming
that the CA seems to have opted for the doctrine of twenty yamas. Both the
commentaries seem to support such a view.

Note: The form gr̥hṇāti is attested in AV \(6.76.4\), but cannot have a

form gr̥bhṇāmi in AV \(3.8.6\), which, with the insertion of the yama, would
read gr̥bh\+bh̐\+ṇāmi. For śradhnāti which is not attested in AV, Whitney
says: “the word most nearly resembling it is śrathnānaḥ \(xiv.1.57\), for which
it may not impossibly be a false reading of the manuscript.” With the insertion
of the yama, the form śrathnānaḥ should read śrath\+th̐\+nānaḥ. Whitney’s
guess is probably on the mark, as the VVRI edition notes the variant
śradhnānaḥ in the manuscript K for śrathnānaḥ in AV \(14.1.57\). It is possible
that our commentary belongs to the tradition represented by the manuscript K
recorded in the VVRI edition. Of course, no manuscripts ever record the
yamas.

१.४.९. हकारान्नासिक्येन ।
Whitney \(1.100\). D, F, Ha, J, M, Na, P: हकारां°. O: °रांनांसिक्येन. A, B:
°नासिकान.
Translation: After h, there is \[insertion of\] a nāsikya \[= h̐?\],
\[before a nasal stop\].
Note: CA \(1.1.26: नासिक्यानां नासिका\) refers to the sound or sounds
called nāsikya ‘\[pure?\] nasal.’ See the Note on CA \(1.1.26\). Whitney ex-
presses his doubts: “What the sound may be which is thus taught to form the
step of transition from the aspiration to a following nasal, it is hard to say with
confidence. I can only conjecture it to be a brief expulsion of surd breath
through the nose, as continuation of the h, before the expulsion of the sonant
breath which constitutes the nasal.” Whitney suggests that, in a word like
brahma : “the Hindu phonetists doubtless regarded the h as belonging with and
uttered like the a; and noticing at the same time the utterance, scarcely to be
avoided, of at least a part of the h in the position of the m, they took account of
it as a separate element, and called it nāsikya.” One of the misconceptions of
Whitney was that he could not accept Sanskrit h to be a voiced aspiration, be-
cause he did not think such a thing was possible. Thus, the nāsikya, if it in-
volved aspiration, was not a ‘surd’ aspiration, but voiced nasal aspiration.
Such nasal voiced aspirates are attested for a modern IA language like Marathi,
e.g. nh \(as in tinhī\), ṇh \(as in kaṇhaṇe\), and, mh \(as in tumhī\). Also see Allen
\(1953: 77\).

१.४.१०. रेफादूष्मणि स्वरपरे स्वरभक्तिरकारस्यार्धं चतुर्थमित्येके ।
Whitney \(1.101\).
Translation: After an r, and before a spirant followed by a
vowel, there is an insertion of a vocalic fraction \(svarabhakti\),
which is \[equivalent to\] half of a short a, or quarter according to
some \[authorities\]. 
Note: Calling it a perfectly intelligible theory, Whitney says: “The
theory evidently is, that a r cannot be pronounced in immediate combination
with any following consonant : there must always be slipped between them a
little bit of a transition-vowel, varying in length, according to different authori-
ties, from a half to an eighth of a mora, and longer before a sibilant or h, if
these be followed in turn by a vowel, than before other consonants; while in
quality it coincides with the a.” 
Whitney, however, was not able to discern the reason why the
fractional vowel inserted before spirants must be longer than before other con-
sonants, though he does note the practice of the AV manuscripts of writing r̥
for r before spirants. Referring to Wackernagel and Debrunner \(1896-1954\),
Vol.I., § 50, Allen \(1953: 73\) points out that, in such cases, “the metre also
occasionally requires the pronunciation of a vowel which is not noted in our
texts \(e.g. darśata = 4 syllables\).” Besides the variation of the length of the in-
serted vowel fraction, different texts suggest that the vowel is r̥, a, i, e, or u, cf.
Allen \(1953: 73\).

\(source?\)
Note: The words varsam and tarsam are cited as examples in the MB
on P.8.3.59. Referring to the verses cited in the commentary, Whitney says:
“Next follow several verses, a part of which are of a character which would
render their introduction under rule 37 \(= CA 1.1.37\), above, more approppri-
ate, while one line, the second, belongs rather under rule 98 \(= CA 1.4.7\).
Placing the responsibility for the inelegance of these verses upon the com-
mentator or the manuscript, Whitney offers the following translation: “Half of
what there is in the r̥-vowel different from r is of the same character with the
preceding vowel. Of consonants separated by audible sound, the conjunction
is destroyed. In the r̥-vowels there is, by express rule, half a mora of r, half a
mora is to be recognized as vowel, and that, again, is thus managed : put the
parts upon both sides of the short vowel, so as to make out a mora : examples
are darśa, varṣa, tatha r̥tavaḥ, \[and\] barhiḥ : know this to be the way when a
svarabhakti is to be produced.” 
There seems to be an important distinction between the svarabhakti of
longer duration and the svarabhakti of the shorter duration. With the svara-
bhakti of the longer duration, as the verses here seem to say, a consonant clus-
ter is broken apart, by the creation of an additional syllable. On the other hand,
as CA 1.4.13, below, shows, the svarabhakti of the shorter duration did not
lead to the break-up of a cluster.

Whitney \(1.102\). A, B, D: Avagraha after °चतुर्थम.
Translation: \[After r\], before another consonant \[= non-
spirant\], \[the inserted fractional vowel is equivalent to\] a quarter
or an eighth \[of a short a in duration\].
Note: See the Note on the previous rule.

१.४.१२. तदेव स्फोटनः ।
Whitney \(1.103\). P separates this rule from the previous rule by add-
ing a daṇḍa as a correction.
Translation: That \[i.e. insertion of the shorter fractional
vowel of 1/8 or 1/4 mora duration\] is itself \[called\] sphoṭana.
Note: There seems to be a difference of opinion between Whitney
and others on what this rule means. Whitney does not seem to identify the
sphoṭana with the shorter svarabhakti, but only admits that a sphoṭana is of the
same duration: “\(Trans:\) Of the latter value is sphoṭana. \(Comment:\) That is to
say, if I do not misapprehend the meaning of the rule, sphoṭana, like the shorter
svarabhakti, has a quarter or an eighth the quantity of a short a : or it may be
that the emphatic eva would restrict the reference to the latter value, the eighth,
alone.” 
Allen \(1953: 74\) seems to understand that the svarabhakti of the length
of 1/8 a to be the element referred to as sphoṭana. Allen further clarifies:
“From a later passage \(= CA 2.1.38: vargaviparyaye sphoṭanaḥ pūrveṇa ced
virāmaḥ\) we learn that this occurs in groups where a stop is followed by an-
other of a more back series, especially a velar \(e.g. in vaṣaṭ-kr̥tam, tad gāyatre\).
... This would appear to indicate a type of svarabhakti, whether voiced or
voiceless, the infinitesimal duration of which is suggested by the specification
of a value 1/8 a, in fact a minimal audible release. The mechanism of the fea-

258अध्याय १, पाद ४
ture referred to is perhaps the release of the front closure during the formation
but before the completion of the back closure, resulting in the momentary out-
flow of an air-stream attenuated by the back constriction.” 
In my view, sphoṭana is just another name for the shorter svarabhakti
of the duration of a quarter of or an eighth of an a, and is not different from
such a svarabhakti.

Note: On the citation from AV \(2.3.1\), Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I.,
p. 40\) says: “Avatká \(p. avat°kám : quoted in the comment to Prāt. i.103 = CA
1.4.12; ii.38 = CA 2.1.38; iv.25 = CA 4.1.25\) is obscure, but is here translated

Translation: \[With the shorter svarabhakti called sphoṭana, it
carries\] the accent of the previous syllable \[lit. vowel\], and there
is no dismemberment of the consonant cluster.
Note: Whitney takes this rule to mean that all the phonetic insertions
taught in this section “are to be reckoned as belonging to the preceding vowel,
and sharing in its accent; and whereas it might seem that the insertion of the
vowel-fragment, and of its kindred sphoṭana, dissolved the conjunction of the
consonants between which they were inserted ... the contrary is expressly de-
clared to be true.” He further states: “The Rik Pr. alone, besides our treatise,
thinks it necessary to say \(vi. 10, r. 35, ccccxi\) that the svarabhakti does not
dissolve the conjunction : in the Vāj. Pr. it is left to be pointed out by the com-
mentator.”

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका259
In my opinion, the present rule is restricted to the shorter svarabhakti
alias sphoṭana, and does not extend to the cases of longer svarabhakti, where as
pointed out by Allen \(1953: 73\): “the metre also occasionally requires the pro-
nunciation of a vowel which is not noted in our texts \(e.g. darśata = 4 sylla-
bles\).” Support for such a restricted interpretation is derived clearly from the
CAB, which refers only to the shorter svarabhakti \(cf. यत्तद्रेफादकारस्य चतुर्थं वा
भवत्यष्टमं वा\), and all the examples it cites are identical with the examples for the
shorter svarabhakti offered under CA \(1.4.11\).

Translation: There are the following cases of protracted
vowels \[in the ŚAV\]: AV \(4.15.15\), \(9.6.18\), \(10.2.28\), \(11.3.
26\), \(11.3.27\), \(12.4.42\), and \(12.5.50\). Why is this listing
made? Any instances beyond this \[listing\] are in excess \[i.e. do
not belong to the ŚAV\]. The following is also the intrinsic
purpose \[of the listing\], \[namely, to point out that\] protractions
are of various types, specifically, three types: followed by
vowels, followed by abhiniṣṭāna \[= visarjanīya, ḥ\], and fol-
lowed by consonants. Among them, those which are followed
by simple vowels are treated as if non-protracted before iti, \[e.g.
ávaśéti, AV \(12.4.42\), Pada: ávaśā3 / íti /\].
Note: Concerning the variant readings and interpretations for the first
passage, see Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p. 175\). On the passage from AV
\(11.3.27\), Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.II., p. 627\) has some important remarks:
“The pluta- or protracted syllables in this and the next verse are quoted in Prāt.
i.105 \(= CA 1.4.14\), but nothing is said as to their accentuation, from which it
seems most plausible to infer that the protraction made no difference in the ac-
cent; and though in the Brāhmaṇas a protracted syllable is always accented, that
is not the invariable rule in the Vedic texts.” Lanman \(ibid.\) also notes the
great variety of mss. readings for the passage concerned. Also see Whitney’s
comments on AV 9.6.18 and 10.2.28, and Strunk \(1983: 68\).
The passage after iti plutāni is treated by Whitney as part of the
commentary, and translated as follows: “for what reason is this enumeration
made? because any other instance than these is in excess : within these limits
the protracted vowel is pointed out by its own meaning \(?\). Protractions are
various; namely, of three kinds: those which affect a syllable ending in a
vowel, in visarjanīya, and in a consonant, respectively; among these, those
which affect syllables ending in simple vowels assume their unprotracted form
before iti.” I have given my own translation above, and I believe it is an
improvement over Whitney’s.
Whitney, on this rule, discusses in some detail, problems of accentua-
tion of the cited examples. However, in most cases, the accents cannot be de-
cided on the basis of either the CA rules or manuscripts. The only case, where

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका261
the CA rule is relevant for the accent of a pluta syllable is AV \(4.15.15\). For a
discussion of the accents of this example, see the Note on CA \(1.4.5\). Also
see Strunk \(1983: 90\).
For the accents of examples from AV \(10.2.28\) and AV \(11.3.26, 27\),
I have followed the readings of the VVRI edition, rather than those of Roth-
Whitney edition. See CA \(4.1.28\) and the Note on it for further discussion on
these examples. Also see Strunk \(1983\) for an extensive discussion.

Note: Notice the difference in the number of rules mentioned for this
Pāda and the cumulative numbers given for the first Adhyāya in the colophons
of different manuscripts. Not only do the manuscripts H and N list only 13
Sūtras for this Pāda, the last Sūtra, i.e. 1.4.14 is most probably not considered
to be a Sūtra by the CAB. On the other hand, the manuscript O says that there
are 19 rules in this Pāda. The manuscript C omits this entire last rule and
offers the cumulative number of Sūtras for this Adhyāya to be 103. On the
other hand, the manuscript I lists the cumulative number of rule for this
Adhyāya to be 110. It not only includes the last passage as part of the Sutra
text, it probably counted its separate parts as seven different Sūtras. It would
seem that this passage is indeed not part of the CAB itself, as it was once
thought by Whitney. This must be the case because this passage does not
comment on some earlier rule. However, its inclusion in the manuscripts of the
CAB indicates that the copyists of this commentary knew that this passage had
been admitted as part of the Sūtra text, though the CAB does not comment on
it.

plicitly combining the separated words given in the Padapāṭha, following the
rules of sandhi. This rule is a general heading \(adhikāra\) with its scope
extending over the second and the third chapters of the CA. However, as
Whitney warns: “We shall see, however, that our treatise does not everywhere
strictly limit itself to what concerns the conversion of pada-text into saṃhitā.”

only the first and last of each series of mutes can occur as finals, this rule might
have said prathamānām, ‘first mutes,’ instead of anuttamānām, ‘mutes not
nasal;’ both this and the following rules, however, seem constructed in view of
the disputed character of the final non-nasal mute, and of the doctrine of
Śaunaka himself that it is a media, and not a tenuis.” One should note that the

अध्याय २, पाद १
264
Padapāṭha lists the separated words as ending in the first stops, i.e. voiceless
unaspirated stops, e.g. yat / yatra, AV \(2.1.1\); tasmāt / vāḥ, AV \(3.13.3\).
However, the present rule is formulated in a generic way. One may see here
not only the need to accommodate the doctrine of Śaunaka, as noticed by
Whitney, but also the influence of the generic grammars of Sanskrit of the type
represented by Pāṇini, cf. P.8.4.53 \(झलां जश् झशि\), which subjects all non-
nasal stops, as well as spirants, to substitution by an appropriate voiced unaspi-
rated stop. However, Pāṇini’s rule applies to internal, as well as external,
sandhis, and interestingly does not specify this change explicitly before
vowels. In a procedure somewhat reminiscent of Śaunaka’s view noted above,
cf. CA \(1.1.10\), Pāṇini, as a generic procedure, changes all word-final non-
nasal stops, and spirants, to the appropriate voiced unaspirated stops, cf.
P.8.2.39 \(झलां जशोऽन्ते\). It is, however, appropriate to note that Pāṇini is not
dealing with word-finals before pause, as is the case with Śaunaka’s doctrine.
We must mention another dilemma raised by this rule. Since the rule
refers to ghoṣavat ‘possessed of ghoṣa, voiced’ and svara ‘vowel’ as separate
classes, a question is raised whether the term ghoṣavat did not include vowels
\(svara\) because vowels do not have the feature of ghoṣa, or whether, for some
reason, the term ghoṣavat was used only for consonants to distinguish voiced
consonants from voiceless consonants. If the first alternative is valid, then one
could argue for two modes of voicing, one represented by ghoṣa, which be-
longed only to voiced consonants, and nāda, which belonged to both the voiced
consonants and vowels. On the other hand, some have argued that there is no
phonetic distinction between nāda and ghoṣa, and that the term ghoṣavat is
used to refer to voiced consonants, with no intention of denying the feature of
ghoṣa to vowels. For the details of this debate, see: Deshpande \(1976,
1976a\), Cardona \(1983, 1986\). Also see: Introduction, section 5.11.

Note: The example तदभूतम् cited by the CAB is not found in the Vul-
gate of the AV, and Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 40\) suggests that this
may have occurred in the genuine Śaunakīya recension of the AV, and that the
Vulgate is not the genuine Śaunakīya recension. It is clear that, in making such
claims, Surya Kanta did not consult the original manuscripts, H and N. Other-
wise, his so-called genuinely Śaunakīya examples may have been तदम्वतम् \(N\)
or तदमूतम् \(H\). Surya Kanta makes no allowance for either the inaccuracies of
the copyists, or for the possibility that the commentator may occasionally quote
a passage which is not Atharvan. Interestingly, Whitney also reports another
example, i.e. त्रिष्टुबत्र cited by the commentator which does not occur in the AV.
However, Surya Kanta does not use that example for raising the same claims.
The example त्रिष्टुबत्र is found in the KV on P.8.2.39 \(झलां जशोऽन्ते\).
२.१.३. पदान्ते चाघोषाः ।
Whitney \(2.3\). D, I \(corr\): °वाघोषाः.
Translation: Further, at the end of a word, \[before a pause,
as in the Padapāṭha, or at the end of a metrical foot in the
Saṃhitāpāṭha, the non-nasal stops\] are replaced with \[the corre-
sponding\] voiceless \[unaspirated stops\].
Note: Whitney comments: “This, in view of i. 6 \(= CA 1.1.8\), is a
superfluous precept, and its introduction is only to be accounted for by the
considerations adverted to under the last rule.” I do not believe that the rule is
superfluous at all. CA \(1.1.8\) is more of the nature of a listing of what could
occur in the word-final position. On the other hand, this rule is an operational
rule achieving that result. Since the inputs to this rule are represented by the
word anuttamānām in the previous rule, it represents a theoretically wider pro-
cedure replacing all possible word-final non-nasal stops with the correspond-
ing voiceless unaspirated stops. The rule is followed by the Saṃhitā and the
Padapāṭha manuscripts for the ŚAV.
Pāṇini 8.4.56 \(वावसाने\) says that the change of word-final non-nasal
stops to voiceless stops is optional, or preferable \(if we follow Kiparsky’s
view, cf. Kiparsky 1979, on the meaning of vā in Pāṇini\). The Kiparskyan
interpretation of Pāṇini brings him closer to the view of the CA. However, the
traditional commentators view this rule as being simply optional, and this may
have influenced the reading in the two CA manuscripts, D, I \(corr\): °वाघोषाः.

Translation: Also, before voiceless \[consonants, the word-
final non-nasal stops become voiceless\].
Note: As with the previous rule, Whitney says: “Also an unnecessary
specification; since final surds do not require to become surds before succeed-
ing initial surds, but simply remain unchanged.” The rule takes a more generic
view of the word-final consonants as inputs for this rule, possibly assuming
that there are words which, in derivational or recitational terms, may be as-
sumed to end in voiced stops. Such a recitational tradition was attributed to
Śaunaka, cf. CA \(1.1.10: प्रथमान्तानि तृतीयान्तानीति शौनकस्य प्रतिज्ञानं न वृत्तिः\). The
rule may be understood as saying that, even if one assumes that the Padapāṭha
could have words ending in non-nasal voiced stops, these must be changed to
their voiceless counterparts in sandhi combinations imminent in the Saṃhitā-
pāṭha. Compare P.8.4.55 \(खरि च\). Note that Pāṇini’s rule does not distinguish
between external versus internal sandhi. The present CA rule, though it applies
to the transformation of the Padapāṭha into Saṃhitāpāṭha, may apply to those
internal sandhis, where the Padapāṭha splits the base from the affix, or
members of a compound. For example, the word apsu \(AV 1.4.4\) is split in
the Padapāṭha as ap\+su. One wonders if the Padapāṭha reading could have
been ab\+su, in accordance with Śaunaka’s precept, cf. CA \(1.1.10\). As-
suming, such a possibility, the present rule would change the b to p in the
Saṃhitāpāṭha. The same sort of dilemma may be perceived in a form like utta-
rasmin \(AV 1.9.1\), which is split up in the Padapāṭha as ut\+tarasmin. A
Padapāṭha which strictly followed the precept of Śaunaka could have had the
reading ud\+tarasmin.

Translation: \[The non-nasal word-final stops\] are replaced
with \[the corresponding\] nasal \[stops, lit. last members of the
stop-series\], before nasal \[stops, lit. last members of the stop-
series\].
Note: Whitney makes an important observation: “The Prātiśākhyas
are unanimous in this requirement. ... Pāṇini, as has already been noticed
\(under i.2 = CA 1.1.3\), \[cf. P.8.4.45: यरोऽनुनासिकेऽनुनासिको वा\], allows either the
unaspirated sonant or the nasal before a nasal, while the manuscript usage is
almost, if not quite, invariably in favor of the nasal.” Whitney’s view of Pāṇini
may now be revised in view of the interpretation proposed by Kiparsky \(1979\)
that vā in Pāṇini refers to a preferred option. This would suggest that Pāṇini’s
preferred option is more in agreement with the Prātiśākhyas and the practice of
the manuscripts.

Note: As Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 62\) points out, the APR
\(136: उत्तमा उत्तमेष्विति\) directly refers to our present rule. Referring to AV
\(1.34.4\), Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p. 35\) says: “The majority of our mss.
\(nor Bp.I.E.D.\) read here madhúghāt in b, as do also the Prāt. mss. in both the
places \(ii.5c = CA 2.1.5; iv.16 = CA 4.1.38\) where the verse is quoted; but at
vi.102.3 all read -du- ; SSP. reads -du- \(as does our text\), and makes no report

अध्याय २, पाद १
268
of discordance among his authorities. The comm. \(= Sāyaṇa\) has -du-, and
derives the word from madhudugha.” Contrary to Whitney’s report, both the
manuscripts of the CAB have the reading madughāt on both the rules referred
to by him, and not madhughāt.

examples are fabricated examples. The same examples are found in the CAB

Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 28-29, 40\) points out that the
VPR \(4.119: असस्थाने मुदि द्वितीयं शौनकस्य\) is a patent reference to CA \(2.1.6\).
However, rejecting Weber’s claim that the CA is later than the VPR, Surya
Kanta says that “the kernel of the VPr. is older than is yet supposed to be.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका269
Such references \(to CA\) can only show the various recasts each work of this
class has undergone.” While it is probably the case that the kind of phonetic
changes taught in this rule were genuinely part of Śaunaka’s doctrine, such a
doctrine is followed neither by the manuscripts of the AV, nor by the manu-
scripts of the CAB. Whitney, on this rule, points out the disagreements be-
tween the different Prātiśākhyas, but finally says: “The manuscripts of the
Atharvan read always the simple surd before the sibilant, and in the printed text
we have of course followed their authority rather than that of the Prātiśākhya.”
This particular doctrine is not followed by Pāṇini, but is ascribed by a Vārttika
on P.8.4.48 to a teacher named Pauṣkarasādi \(चयो द्वितीयाः शरि पौष्करसादेः\).
Even while intending to exemplify this rule, the manuscripts of the commentary
do not show the change in writing. 
२.१.७. तेभ्यः पूर्वचतुर्थो हकारस्य ।
Whitney \(2.7\).
Translation: After them \[i.e. word-final non-nasal stops, the
following\] h is replaced by the fourth \[member of the stop-
series, i.e. the voiced aspirated stop\], corresponding to the pre-
ceding \[word-final stop\].
Note: As Whitney notes, the Prātiśākhyas generally follow this rule,
but that Pāṇini \(8.4.62: झयो होऽन्यतरस्याम्\) allows this change optionally. The
mss. of both the AV, as well as those of the CAB, almost universally follow
the rule. All the examples cited by the commentator are examples of a word-
final t, as given in the AV Padapāṭha, combined with the following h. In all the
cases, the Pāṇinians are likely to treat the first member as ending in d, rather
than in t, cf. P.8.2.39. However, the CA tradition converts all prepausal non-
nasal stops to voiceless unaspirated stops. Pāṇinian commentators offer ex-
amples of other word-final non-nasal stops combined with the word-initial h.
Macdonell \(1916, 1971: 39\), offers Vedic examples like sadhryàg ghitā́ from
sadhryàk \+ hitā́, and ávāḍ ḍhavyā́ni from ávāṭ \+ havyā́ni. While the CA rule is
a generic rule, the examples offered in the commentary do not exhibit the vari-
ety required to justify this generality. It is possible that the rule shows the oc-
casional shift of the CA in the direction of the general grammar of Sanskrit.

Note: Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 60\) states that the APR
\(163\) and the CAB on the present rule cite identical examples. However, note
that, in this case, the APR cites only the first three examples out of the total of
six cited by the CAB. One should also point out that this is not a case of a
gaṇa or a complete listing, and the examples are only illustrative in both the
texts. Also see APR \(p. 110\).
२.१.८. टकारात्सकारे तकारेण ।
Whitney \(2.8\). P adds a daṇḍa after this rule as a correction, while O
crosses out a daṇḍa as a correction.
Translation: After a \[final\] ṭ, a \[dental\] t \[is inserted\], before
an \[initial\] s.
Note: The insertion of t between ṭ and s facilitates the transition from
ṭ to s. It suggests that after an unreleased ṭ, there is first a shift of the organs to
the position of a dental stop, before moving on to the dental spirant. The clo-
sure begins at the retroflex position and then shifts, without release to the den-
tal position.

Note: The examples offered by the commentators illustrate the
juncture of one word with the next, the juncture of a base with an affix, and the
juncture of the first member of a compound with the second. In all these cases,
the Padapāṭha splits the components.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका271
Referring to the first example cited above, Whitney and Lanman \(AV
Transl. Vo.II., p. 508\) make some important observations: “No ms. \!of ours∀
inserts t between -rā́ṭ and sva- in b \!but four of SSP’s do so∀, as required by
Prāt. ii.8 \(under which this is one of the passages quoted\).” Given this condi-
tion of the mss., one needs to seriously investigate, whether certain mss. or
groups of mss. follow the rules of the CA more consistently, and whether this
reflects a somewhat separate transmission.
The manuscripts of the CAB, while offering examples for this rule
show neither the Padapāṭha form, nor the Saṃhitāpāṭha form, but read a final ḍ
followed by an initial ś, without showing the insertion of t.
२.१.९. ङणनेभ्यः कटतैः शषसेषु ।
Whitney \(2.9\). E, F \(orig\): ङणनेमः°. I: 10. O adds a daṇḍa after
ङणनेभ्यः.
Translation: After \[final\] ṅ, ṇ, and n, \[respectively\] the \[sounds\] k,
ṭ, and t \[are inserted\], before ś, ṣ, and s.
Note: Whitney says: “The form of this rule is a little ambiguous,
since we might be left by it to query whether, for instance, after ṅ, was to be
inserted k before ś, ṭ before ṣ, and t before s, or only k before all the three sibi-
lants - in other words, whether the transition-sound should adapt itself to the
character of the following or of the preceding letter. The commentator either
does not notice, or does not deign to relieve, this difficulty; he offers no expla-
nation of the rule, and, in the instances which he cites, the manuscript persis-
tently omits to write the transition-sound.”
While the manuscripts are unclear because of the lack of writing the
transition-sound, the commentary does clear one doubt. The one-to-one
matching \(yathāsaṅkhya\) does not work across the board. The commentary
does clearly indicate that a final ṅ may be followed by ś, ṣ, and s. The same
holds true for final ṇ and n. As far as the CA rule is concerned, Whitney also
correctly assumes: “For phonetic reasons, however, it cannot be doubted that
the latter is determined by the preceding letter, and that after ṅ is to be uttered a
k, after ṇ a ṭ, and after n a t, before all the sibilants.” However, it is not clear
whether such an assumption was widely shared by all the different grammatical
traditions. For instance, Pāṇini treats ṅ and ṇ differently from n. P.8.3.28
\(ङ्णोः कुक्टुक् शरि\) says that, after ṅ and ṇ, optionally, the augments kUK and
ṭUK are respectively inserted, before ś, ṣ, and ś. Then P.8.3.30 \(नश्च\) says
that, after n, the augment dhUṬ \(dh>t\) is optionally inserted before s. Finally,

अध्याय २, पाद १
272
P.8.3.31 \(शि तुक्\) says that, after n, the augment tUK is inserted before ś.
None of these rules cover the case of a word final n being followed by an ini-
tial ṣ. On the other hand, the CAB clearly offers an attested case of a word-fi-
nal n followed by an initial ṣ, e.g. śītān\+ṣaṭ \(AV 8.9.17\).
The manuscripts of the AV are irregular at best in showing these tran-
sitional sounds, and the manuscripts of the CAB do not show them at all. 
The logic of this phenomenon is elucidated by Whitney as follows:
“The insertion of these tenues after the nasals is a purely physical phenomenon,
and one which is very natural, and liable to occur in any one’s pronunciation.
There is to be made, in each case, a double transition in utterance: from the so-
nant nasal to the surd oral emission, and the former is made an instant earlier
than then latter, if the nasal resonance is stopped just before, instead of exactly
at the same time with, the transfer of the organs to the position of the sibilant, a
tenues of the same position with the nasal becomes audible. It is, as already
remarked under i. 99 \(= CA 1.4.8\), the counterpart of the nasal yama, asserted
by the Hindu phonetists to be heard between a mute and following nasal. It is
also closely analogous with the conversion of nś into ñch, as will be pointed
out below \(under rule 17 = CA 2.1.17\).”
The artificial examples cited under this rule by the CAB are comparable
in general to examples found in the KV on P.8.3.28-30.

Note: Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 40\) points out that this rule
is not followed by the Vulgate mss. for the AV. From this, and such other
facts, he concludes “\(1\) that CA records saṃdhis for the Śaunaka AV; \(2\) that
these are not observed by the Vulgate mss.; \(3\) that the Vulgate does not repre-
sent the Śaunaka śākhā, but some other.” Surya Kanta, fully convinced of his
own conclusions, does not notice the fact that the sandhis prescribed by the CA

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका273
are not applied by the manuscripts of the CAB to the very examples which are
supposed to illustrate those sandhis. Whitney himself has noted this fact many
times, and the present edition also makes that amply clear. Thus, if the manu-
scripts of the very CA and its commentary fail to apply the sandhis taught by
this very text, so could, and probably did, the manuscripts of the very
Śaunakīya AV itself. This happened most probably because the Śaunakīya
tradition itself underwent significant change, as evidenced by the APR. Surya
Kanta forgets to notice the significance of the fact that a significant number of
manuscripts of the CA also contain the text of the APR, and the manuscript
tradition has consistently treated both of these texts as belonging to the
Śaunakīya tradition. See the manuscripts B, M, P, VR, and V \(APR, Introduc-
tion, p. 1-3\). All these manuscripts have also been used for the present edition
of the CA. The manuscripts, as the final colophons show, were copied and
meant to be studied by the Brahmins who did not distinguish between the
śākhās of these two texts, and who were all followers of the Śaunakīya AV.
For instance, the final colophon for the Jyotiṣagrantha included in the mss. B
used by Surya Kanta \(ibid, p. 1\) says: एवं शौनकशाखायां ब्रह्मवेदस्याङ्गं ज्योतिषग्रंथं
ब्रह्मकाश्यपानुवादं समाप्तम्. The same manuscript contains the texts of CA and
APR, and the whole mss. was meant for the study of a Brahmin named
Br̥haspatiji in the Pañcoli family from Anahilapurapattana. Descendants of this
Pañcoli family are followers of the Śaunakīya AV till this very day, and the last
few surviving reciters of the Śaunakīya AV come from this family.
Concerning this rule, Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., Intro., p. cxxiv\)
says: “Pr. ii.9 ordains that between ṅ, ṇ, n and ś, ṣ, s respectively, k, ṭ, t be in
all cases introduced; the first two thirds of the rule never have an opportunity to
make themselves good, as the text offers no instance of a conjunction of ṅ with
ś or of ṇ with ṣ; that f final n with initial s, however, is very frequent, and the t
has always been introduced by us. The usage of the mss. is slightly varying
\[‘exceedingly irregular,’ says W. in his note to the present rule of CA\]: there is
not a case perhaps where some one of them does not make the insertion, and
perhaps hardly one in which they all do so without variation.” On AV 6.51.1,
Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.II., p. 319\) remarks: “The Atharvan reading, ac-
cording to the Prāt. phonetic rule ii.9 \(= CA 2.1.9\), ought to be pratyáṅk before
a following ś; but \(as explained in the note to that rule\) the mss. read simple ṅ,
and both printed texts adopt it.”

Whitney \(2.10\). A, B: नकारः for ञकारः. O: यकारः for ञकारः. P: शकार
for शकारे.
Translation: Before ś, n is replaced with ñ.
Note: This rule needs to be understood in conjunction with CA
\(2.1.17: तवर्गीयाच्छकारः शकारस्य\), which changes ś to ch, after a dental stop.
The examples as cited by the commentator show the change of -n\+ś- to -ñ\+ch-.
These two rules raise interesting questions as regards the order of their appli-
cation. However, such theoretical questions are not discussed by the com-
mentary. The dilemmas, however, are transparent. If we apply CA \(2.1.10\)
first, and change the n to ñ, then we cannot apply CA \(2.1.17\), because that
rule changes ś to ch after a dental stop, and ñ is not a dental stop. On the other
hand, if we first apply CA \(2.1.17\), and change ś to ch after n, then we can no
longer apply CA \(2.1.10\) which changes n to ñ before ś, and there is no longer
a ś after n. Also see Note under CA \(2.1.17\).

Translation: \[The final n changes to ñ, also\] before a voiced
\[stop\] belonging to the c-series.
Note: As Whitney points out: “That is to say, before j; since jh, as
already noticed, never occurs, and ñ is never found as initial.” The exclusion
of voiceless stops c and ch is important, because the final n behaves differently
before these sound, cf. devān\+ca > devā̃śca / devāṃśca. The manuscripts of
the AV do not consistently show this change, and, instead of the expected ñ,
sometimes we find an anusvāra, or a dental n. For example, on AV \(1.33.2\),
Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p. 33\) notes that only about half of the mss. carry
out the prescribed sandhi. The Whitney-Roth edition generally has an
anusvāra. S.P. Pandit’s edition and the VVRI edition read -an j- without ap-
plying this sandhi rule.

ning of “any word in the Atharvan, any more than in the other Vedas, and this
rule is as unnecessary as is the inclusion of ṇ along with the other nasals in rule
9 of this chapter \(= CA 2.1.9\), and as is more than one rule or part of a rule in
that which is to follow: such specifications are made merely for the sake of a

conjectures which are clearly preferable to the reading in the manuscripts,
which as they stand cannot even illustrate this rule. These are clearly artificial
examples, not attested in the known text of the AV. However, with respect to
these examples, Surya Kanta does not raise his claim that these instances may
have occurred in the genuine text of the Śaunakīya recension.

The corruptions भवार्णीयते and महार्णीयते in both the mss. for the original
भवाण्डीयते and महाण्डीयते are comparable to the corruption of खट्वैडका to खट्वैरगा on
CA 3.2.27. These corruptions, which seem to change ḍ to r, seem to be indi-
cations of the probable Rajasthani origin of the manuscripts, cf. Ernest Bender
\(1992: 90-91\)
२.१.१३. तकारस्य शकारलकारयोः परसस्थानः ।
Whitney \(2.13\). A, B, D: °परमःस्थानः. Ha, J, M, N, P: °परसःस्थानः.
Translation: Before ś and l, t is changed to a sound sharing
the same point of articulation as the following sound.
Note: Whitney points out that the sandhi of t with ś is not complete
without rule CA \(2.1.17\), which changes ś to ch after a dental stop.
The term parasasthāna refers to a sound which has the same point of
articulation as the following sound. In comparison with other treatises, we
know that a final t is changed to c before ś, and to l before l. The first change
is more obvious than the second, because t and l share the same sthāna ‘point
of articulation,’ i.e. both are dental \(dantya\), and hence it is not clear why this
rule should change a t to l before l. Since, t and l are already sasthāna of each
other, the formulation of the rule is basically faulty. Pāṇini’s formulation
averts such a difficulty by using the term parasavarṇa instead of the term para-
sasthāna, cf. P.8.4.60 \(तोर्लि\) with parasavarṇaḥ continuing from P.8.4.58. The
term sasthāna simply refers to the sharing of a common point of articulation,
while the term savarṇa, as defined by P.1.1.9 \(तुल्यास्यप्रयत्नं सवर्णम्\), refers to
those sounds which share the same point of articulation \(sthāna\) as well as the
internal effort \(prayatna\). While t and l are sasthāna ‘having a common point
of articulation,’ they are not savarṇa ‘having a common point of articulation
and internal effort.’ Pāṇini asks us to replace a dental stop, before l, with a
sound which is parasavarṇa. The only sounds which share the same point of
articulation and internal effort with l, are l itself and its nasal variety, i.e. l̃.
Thus, a final t is changed to l, and a final n is changed to l̃. Neither the CAB,
nor Whitney, show any awareness of these theoretical difficulties. This also
raises a significant question about how much of this text is pre-Pāṇinian.

Note: The manuscripts of the AV, as well as those of the CA, most
often do not fully observe this sandhi as it relates to the juncture of t and ś, and
write ch for cch.
२.१.१४. चटवर्गयोश्च ।
Whitney \(2.14\). A, B: चटर्गीयोश्च.
Translation: Before the consonants of the c-series and ṭ-
series, \[a final t is changed to a consonant which shares the
same point of articulation as the following consonant\].
Note: This rule also shows that the CA makes certain assumptions
which are not brought out by the CAB. One such assumption is that out of the
possible substitutes, one selects a replacement which is closest to the original in
terms of phonetic features. This principle is stated by Pāṇini in P.1.1.50
\(स्थानेऽन्तरतमः\), and CA \(1.4.4: आन्तर्येण वृत्तिः\). For example, when a final t is
followed by c, we are told that t changes to a consonant which is parasasthāna
‘shares the same point of articulation as the following sound.’ The sounds i, e,
c-series, and ś, all share the same point of articulation. They are all tālavya
‘palatal.’ The principle given in CA \(1.4.4\) tells us that we replace t with c,
and not with some other sound.

Note: The fact that there are no examples attested in the Vulgate of
the AV for illustrating a t followed by a retroflex stop is taken by Surya Kanta
\(APR, Introduction, p. 39\) as a possible indication that the Vulgate is not a
genuinely Śaunakīya recension, and that a genuinely Śaunakīya recension may
have contained such examples. On the other hand, I believe that Whitney is
probably correct in suggesting that a rule like this is perhaps an indication of
this text straying occasionally into the requirements of a general grammar for
Sanskrit, and he points to similar examples in the commentaries on P.8.4.40-41

portion of this rule with CA 2.1.17, and omits CA 2.1.16: ताभ्यां समानपदे तवर्गी-

Translation: Within the same word, after these \[= stops of
the c-series, i.e. palatal stops, and the ṭ-series, i.e. retroflex
stops\], a member of the t-series \[i.e. a dental stop\] is replaced
with a sound which shares the same point of articulation as the
previous \[palatal or retroflex stop\].

Note: Whitney points out that all the cases of this rule illustrated by
the commentary fall in the category of internal sandhi which results only if one
is interested in the derivation of the word mūḍha, and not its relationships with
the preceding or the succeeding word, which is the proper area for a Prāti-
śākhya. The CAB on CA \(1.1.2\) says: 
सन्ध्यपद्याविति किमर्थम् । ‘लीढ’मित्यत्र हो ढत्वम् \(cf. ‘हो ढः,’ पा.
८.२.३१\)। पर\(H, N: °द, Whitney: °र\)चतुर्थत्वम् \(cf. ‘झषस्तथोर्धोऽधः,’

दीर्घोऽणः,’ पा. ६.३.१११\) वैयाकरणेन वक्तव्यम् ।
The word mūḍha is derived in the same way, where the root muh is
followed by the past participle affix -ta. The CAB, and perhaps the CA, seem
to assume a derivational process analogous to the Pāṇinian process cited in the

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका279
commentary passage above. The h of the root muh is replaced with ḍh before
the affix -ta. Then the present CA rule changes t of -ta, coming after ḍh, to ḍh,
giving us the stage muḍh\+ḍha. The present CA rule does not go beyond this
stage. According to Pāṇinian derivation, however, ḍh is deleted before ḍh by
P.8.3.13 \(ढो ढे लोपः\), and the preceding vowel is lengthened by P.6.3.111
\(ढ्रलोपे पूर्वस्य दीर्घोऽणः\). Whitney is, however, correct is saying that such a
derivational process does not truly concern a Prātiśākhya, a point also made by
the CAB on CA \(1.1.2\).
Whitney also suggests: “The only practical application of the precept is
one which is not recognized, or at least not illustrated, by the commentator;
namely, to those cases in which an initial s followed by a t or th is, by later
rules \(ii. 90 = CA 2.4.10 etc.\), converted to ṣ : the following dental then be-
comes by this rule a lingual.” While the change indicated by Whitney does in-
deed take place in forms like anuṣṭhita, it cannot take place by the present CA
rule, because the present CA rule strictly applies to a dental stop which follows
a palatal or a retroflex stop, and not something that follows any palatal or retro-
flex sound. The change indicated by Whitney does, however, take place by the
following CA rule, i.e. CA \(2.1.16\).
In any case, this rule, along with several successive rules, illustrates the
relatively less common process of regressive assimilation. Generally, Sanskrit
shows progressive assimilation. 
२.१.१६. षकारान्नानापदेऽपि ।
Whitney \(2.16\). F, I: °रांतांनाना°.  O omits this rule.
Translation: After an ṣ, even in a different word \[i.e. even
across a word-boundary\], \[a dental stop is replaced with a
sound which has the same point of articulation as the preceding
ṣ\].

१५.६\)। ‘षण्णवतिः’ \(not in AV, ‘षण्णवत्यै,’ तै.सं. ७.२.
१५.१, काठकसं. ४२.५\)।
Note: Whitney says that the example ṣaṣṭiḥ properly ‘belongs under
the preceding rule.’ This is not quite true. The preceding rule, as pointed out
earlier, applies only to dental stops which follow palatal or retroflex stops, and

अध्याय २, पाद १
280
not which follow palatal or retroflex sounds across the board. In any case, an
example like ṣaṣṭiḥ constitutes an example of internal sandhi, which concerns
the process of word-derivation, which strictly speaking is not the concern of a
Prātiśākhya. However, as Whitney indicates on the preceding rule, one can
think of a ‘word-internal’ application for this rule, where the initial s of a root
is changed to ṣ because of the preceding vowel across the word-boundary.
The dental stop following such an ṣ then changes to a retroflex stop, e.g. anu\+
sthita > anu\+ṣthita > anu\+ṣṭhita. Numerous examples of this kind can be
found in the text of the Atharvan.
The example ṣaṇṇavatiḥ is offered in the KV on P. 8.4.42 \(न पदान्ताट्टोर-
नाम्\), to illustrate the Vārttika: अनाम्नवतिनगरीणामिति वाच्यम्. Since the example
ṣaṇṇavatiḥ is not attested in the AV, what would be a proper AV example? In
this case, Whitney rightly points out: “The precept was evidently only intended
for such combinations as bahiṣ ṭe \(i.3.1\), in which, by the rules contained in the
fourth section of this chapter, an original final s becomes lingualized, and the
following t is assimilated to it.”
२.१.१७. तवर्गीयाच्छकारः शकारस्य ।
Whitney \(2.17\). A, B \(corr\), D, J: तवर्गीयाः°. 
Translation: After a member of the t-series \[i.e. a dental
stop\], ś is replaced with ch.
Note: This rule works in conjunction with rules 2.1.10 and 2.1.13
above. See Notes on those rules for problems regarding the mutual relations
between these rules as formulated. Whitney also points out: “This rule, taken
in connection with rules 10 \(= CA 2.1.10\) and 13 \(= CA 2.1.13\), above, de-
termines the form to be assumed by the combinations t\+ś and n\+ś. Exception
may fairly be taken, however, to the method in which the change is taught. By
the other rules referred to, t and n are to become c and ñ before ś: and if those
rules are first applied, there will be no dental mutes for ś to follow; while, if the
present rule be first applied, the others are rendered wholly or in part superflu-
ous, by the non-occurrence of ś after t and n. In the case of t there comes in the
still farther difficulty that rule 6 of this chapter \(= CA 2.1.6\) has converted it
into th, so that a part of rule 13 is thereby also rendered incapable to applica-
tion. These are incongruencies such as the authors of the Prātiśākhyas are very
seldom guilty of. What is the intention of our treatise is, indeed, sufficiently
clear.” The kind of problems pointed out by Whitney in the application of CA
rules have been handled with far greater sophistication in the Pāṇinian system

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका281
with devices like a\) sthānivadbhāva ‘treating a substitute as if it had some of
the same properties as the original,’ b\) rule ordering and well-defined proce-
dures for conflict-resolution and priority, and c\) treating a rule or it result as if
it is not in effect for some other rules \(asiddha\).

य॒तीम॒भि’ \(अ.वे. ३.१.३\)। ‘दि॒वि षञ्छु॒क्रः’ \(अ.वे. १८.
४.५९\)।
Note: Whitney points out: “The commentator cites examples only of
the combination of n and ś. ... As an example illustrative of the other part of
the rule, we may take ārāc charavyāḥ \(i.19.1\).”
Whitney further points out that the manuscripts “with hardly an excep-
tion, write simply ch, instead of cch.” While this observation is beyond doubt,
Whitney draws some debatable conclusions: “This orthography \(i.e. ch, rather
than cch\) is also, to my apprehension, a truer representation of the actual pho-
netic result of combining t with ś. That these sounds fuse together into a ch is
very strong evidence that the utterance of the Sanskrit surd palatals did not dif-
fer materially from that of our ch \(in church etc.\); and I conceive that the con-
stant duplication of the ch and jh \(wherever the latter occurs\) between two
vowels is to be looked upon simply as an indication of the heaviness of those
consonants, and of their effect to make the preceding vowel long by position.”
I think Whitney seems to overlook the fact that the representation cch is not a
mere orthographic representation, but that the processes of syllabication would
require that the initial c be part of the previous syllable, with the next syllable
beginning with ch. Such a syllabic division was obligatory in Sanskrit, espe-
cially, if the previous syllable had a short vowel. In NIA languages like Hindi
and Marathi, however, we can have a ch preceded by a short vowel forming a
light syllable in words like bichānā > bi-chā-nā. In Sanskrit, there is no reason
to believe that ch was always a heavy consonant. After long vowels and sen-
tence-initially, one has no reason to assume that ch must be a heavy consonant.
Assuming the compound nature of ch, Whitney says: “The conversion
of nś into ñch, on the supposition of the compound nature of the palatal, as
made up of a mute and a sibilant element, would be almost precisely analogous
with that of ns into nts, as taught in rule 9, above, and would be readily and
simply explainable as a phonetic process.” While there is indeed some com-
monality between these two cases, one must note that the Sanskrit tradition

अध्याय २, पाद १
282
treated ch as a single sound, while ts was always treated as a consonant cluster.
In the cluster ts, after the initial closure for t, one has the continuant s. On the
other hand, ch is unlike n\+c\+ś, in that ch has aspiration as part of it release, but
does not have the continuant feature of ś. Such a distinction allows ts to be
split in a syllabic division as -t\+s-. Such a division is not available for ch.

Note: Referring to the form utthuḥ in AV \(7.52.2\), Whitney \(AV
Transl. Vol.I., p. 422\) remarks: “SSP. strangely reads, with the comm. and the
majority of his authorities, and with part of ours \(P.?O.R.\), ut sthur in c,
against both general grammar and the Prātiśākhya \(ii.18; its commentary quotes
this passage as an illustration of the rule\).” In all the cases of ut\+sthā cited by
the commentary, the Padapāṭha clearly retains the s of sthā. However, as
Whitney points out: “Wherever, however, the preposition receives the accent,
and enters into a more intimate combination with the root, as in the participle
útthita, the pada-text \(by iv. 62 = CA 4.2.16\) does not separate the compound,
or restore the original s, but reads the same form which appears in saṃhitā. Of
this kind is also the only example of the root stambh combined with the prepo-
sition ud which our text presents, viz. satyeno ’ttabhitā \(xiv.1.1\), where the
pada reads úttabhitā, and not út-stabhitā.” Also compare this rule with P.8.4.61
\(उदः स्थास्तम्भोः पूर्वस्य\). The CA rule is closer to Pāṇini as compared to other
Prātiśākhyas, as Whitney points out: “The Vāj. Pr. \(iv. 95\) notices the loss of s
from the root stambh, but, as Weber remarks with surprise, omits all mention
of sthā. The Taitt. Pr. \(v. 14\) includes these cases in a more general rule, that s
is dropped when preceded by ud and followed by a consonant.”
२.१.१९. रेफस्य रेफे ।
Whitney \(2.19\).

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका283
Translation: R \[is deleted\] before r.
Note: As Whitney notes: “The r which is thus dropped must itself, of
course, be the product of euphonic processes taught elsewhere \(ii. 42, 43 = CA
2.2.3-4\). The protraction of a preceding short vowel when an r is thus dropped
is prescribed in a later rule \(iii. 20 = CA 3.1.20\).” However, the CA rules
must be clearly contrasted with Pāṇinian rules P.8.3.13 \(ढो ढे लोपः\) and P.6.3.
111 \(ढ्रलोपे पूर्वस्य दीर्घोऽणः\), which prescribe additionally a deletion of a ḍh before
ḍh, and the lengthening of the preceding vowel. The CAB on CA \(1.1.2\)
knows these Pāṇinian rules, and the same commentary on CA \(2.1.15\), if not
CA \(2.1.15\) itself, seems to presuppose such rules. See Notes on CA \(1.1.2\)
and CA \(2.1.15\).

Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 40\) suggests that this may have occurred
in the genuine Śaunakīya recension of the AV, and that the Vulgate is not the
genuine Śaunakīya recension. However, the fact that it occurs in the KV may
perhaps mean that it could have been taken by our commentary from a gram-
matical source like the KV.

Note: This rule is interesting in that it does not seem to apply to the
transformation of the words given in the Padapāṭha to their Saṃhitā versions,
or vice versa, and hence it does not fit a strict definition of the purpose of a
Prātiśākhya. To make sense of the inclusion of such rules, one may perhaps
propose that the CA is trying to clearly distinguish its recitational practice from
the norms of generic Sanskrit, and from other traditions, cf. Whitney: “Neither
of the other known Prātiśākhyas teaches the same omission, or even notices it
as prescribed by any authority.” Concerning the practice taught by this rule,
Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol. I., Intro., p. cxxv\) says: “Abbreviation of the
consonant-groups: as in paṅkti and the like. -- By ii.20 \(= CA 2.1.20\) a non-
nasal mute coming in the course of word-formation between a nasal and a non-
nasal is dropped: so paṅti; chintam and rundhi in stead of \[paṅkti\], chinttam
and runddhi; etc. The manuscripts observe this rule quite consistently,
although not without exceptions; and it has been uniformly followed in the
edition. At xii.1.40, anuprayuṅktām iaccidental exception; and here, for
once, the mss. happen to agree in retaining the k. \!Cthe Hibernicisms
stren’th, len’th, etc.∀” Note that the comments enclosed between the L-brackets
‘\!’ and ‘∀’ are added by Lanman. On the other hand, the VVRI edition does
not follow this rule, and maintains the k/g in its readings.
This rule also needs to be contrasted with CA \(2.1.9: ङणनानां कटतैः
शषसेषु\), which prescribes: “After \[final\] ṅ, ṇ, and n, \[respectively\] the \[sounds\]
k, ṭ, and t \[are inserted\], before ś, ṣ, and s.” While CA \(2.1.9\) has parallels
elsewhere, the present rule does not.

Note: The deletion taught by this rule is not practiced by the mss. of
the CAB. The consonant groups as assumed in the counter-examples are not
seen either in the manuscripts of the AV, nor in those of the CAB. Also the
counter-examples are not chosen with proper care in that several of them con-
tain multiple violations of the conditions at a time, rather than illustrating
strictly the single condition referred to by the query अनुत्तम इति किमर्थम्. In the
text of the commentary above, I have given the examples with the consonant
clusters as expressly intended by the commentary, and noted the manuscript
readings which do not actually illustrate the intended clusters.
२.१.२१. स्वराद्यवयोः पदान्तयोः ।
Whitney \(2.21\). I: 20.
Translation: After a vowel, word-final y and v \[are deleted\].
Note: As Whitney points out: “This rule applies, on the one hand, to
the y and v of the syllables ay, av, āy, āv \(the latter, however, being excepted
by the following rule\), into which, by iii. 40 \(= CA 3.2.17\), e, o, ai, and au are
converted before a vowel; and, on the other hand, to the y into which, by ii. 41
\(= CA 2.2.2\), visarjanīya theoretically passes before an initial vowel.” I object
to the word ‘theoretically’ used by Whitney. While it is true that the CA seems
to demand unconditional deletion of a y derived from a visarjanīya, and, there-
fore, this y becomes a seemingly theoretical entity, other schools were not so
categorical about this deletion, and hence this y could appear in the final result,
cf. KV on P.8.3.19 \(लोपः शाकल्यस्य\) says: शाकल्यग्रहणं विभाषार्थम् । तेन यदापि
लघुप्रयत्नतरो न भवत्यादेशस्तदापि व्योः पक्षे श्रवणं भवति. Also contrast the fact that
such a deletion takes place, according to Pāṇini, before aŚ, i.e. vowels and
voiced consonants. The CA rule is a statement of unconditional deletion. In
any case, this procedure was widely disputed, and Whitney records the wide
spectrum of views in the traditional phonetic literature concerning these
disputes.

Prātiśākhya does not recognize as forming part of the Atharvan text: these are
pādā ucyete \(xix.6.5\), and citrā imā vr̥ṣabhau \(xix.13.1\).” One cannot discount
the possibility that the 19th book represents a somewhat different linguistic tra-
dition and constitutes a relatively late addition to the rest of the books. How-
ever, note that the Padapāṭha does not render citrā of the Saṃhitā with citrau as
Whitney seems to assume, but leaves it as citrā. If such be the case, then it
would not come under the scope for the present rule.

the twentieth book of the text, but with that book the Prātiśākhya has nothing to
do.” 
APR \(155\), which seems to be referring to our CA rule, also teaches
that in gaviṣṭau and gaveṣaṇaḥ the v is not elided. Surya Kanta makes a case
that making such a rule which can apply to the Saṃhitā text was originally not
the function of the APR, which was originally supposed to describe only the
peculiarities of the Pada text, and that such rules were added later to it. On the
other hand, he argues that the CA was from the very beginning a treatise deal-
ing with the conversion of the Padas into Saṃhitā, and that a rule such as the
present one is more genuinely suited to it. See: APR, Introduction, pp. 25-26. 
२.१.२४. लेशवृत्तिरधिस्पर्शं शाकटायनस्य ।
Whitney \(2.24\). A, B, D: °स्पृर्शं°. O: °स्पर्शां°.
Translation: According to Śākaṭāyana, there is a weak ar-
ticulation \[of the word-final y and v discussed in the earlier
rules\], as regards the feature of contact \[between the articulator
and the point of articulation\].
Note: As Whitney’s survey of the various texts shows, the doctrine
ascribed to Śākaṭāyana here is offered as an option by most texts, and is occa-
sionally ascribed to other scholars like Vātsapra. P.8.3.18 \(व्योर्लघुप्रयत्नतरः शाक-
टायनस्य\) ascribes the same view to Śākaṭāyana, but uses a slightly different
term: laghuprayatnataraḥ “relatively weaker articultory effort.” Pāṇini 8.3.19
\(लोपः शाकल्यस्य\) ascribes the deletion of final y and v to Śākalya. By default, it
would seem that these sounds were neither deleted nor weakened, but were
pronounced with the normal force in Pāṇini’s own school. This gives us a
wide range of pronunciation for final y and v across the various dialects of
Sanskrit. What is noteworthy, however, is that the view of deletion, which is
ascribed by Pāṇini expressly to Śākalya, is the default view in CA. While it
does care, for some reason, to record the view of Śākaṭāyana, it does not care
to record the view of normal pronunciation of y and v. It should be noted that
there is a close relationship of the CA tradition to the views expressed by

Translation: Before a voiceless stop not followed by a spi-
rant, the m of pum is changed to a visarjanīya \[i.e. ḥ\], except in
puṃśca etc.
Note: Whitney’s frustration with the rule and the commentary is
manifest in his comments: “This is a rule very hard to get along with. In the
first place, it is altogether unnecessary and uncalled for, since of all the words
to which it is intended to apply, but a single one, puṃścalī, is found in the
Atharvan text, and that one is written by the pada-text precisely as in saṃhitā,
and so requires no explanation from the Prātiśākhya.” 
Besides the fact that the rule seems to step into the un-Prātiśākhyan ter-
ritory of general grammatical derivation, the condition apuṃścādiṣu creates a
number of problems. The first problem is that the form puṃśca already seems
to show the operation of the rule. If so, then what is being excluded by saying
apuṃścādiṣu? The CAB offers puṃścora as a counter-example. However, as
Whitney agonizes: “But puṃścora, ‘he-thief,’ is as regular an instance of the
application of the rule as puṃskāmā or puṃścalī; nor does it seem possible to
find in apuṃścādiṣu itself any form which constitutes an exception to the pre-
vious specifications. I can only conjecture that the reading is corrupt, and was
corrupt before the commentator set himself at work upon it, and that his expla-
nation was as unintelligible to himself as it is to us. The specification may have
been intended for such words as puṃkhyāna, which constitutes an actual
exception to the rule, and it is cited as such in Böhtlingk’s note to Pāṇini
viii.3.6, as from the Siddhānta-Kaumudī.”

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका289
It is now quite clear that apuṃścādiṣu is an ancient corruption. It is
shared by all the manuscripts, and, as Whitney correctly assumes, it must have
been there already when the author of the CAB attempted to explain the word.
Whitney’s comment quoted above, led me to look for a possible emendation.
Having looked at the shapes of the letters kh and c in Gupta and pre-Gupta
scripts, it seems very likely that these two letters were confused, and a possible
apuṃkhādiṣu was misread as apuṃścādiṣu. The expression apuṃkhādiṣu
would not only exclude puṃkhyāna cited by Whitney, but also the relatively
earlier expression puṃkha, which is traditionally etymologized as pum\+kha \[<
pumāṃsaṃ khanati, pum\+khan\+Ḍa, etymology offered in Śabdakalpadruma,
Vol. 3, p. 163\].
Another possible reading is apuṃkṣādiṣu, which wouexclude cases
like puṃkṣīraḥ and puṃkṣuraḥ. However, these examples are already taken
care of by the exclusion anūṣmapare, and one would not need a separate exclu-
sion to be stated. Therefore, the reading apuṃkhādiṣu seems to be a better
emendation. Another word which fits in the same category as puṃkha is
puṃkheṭa, which is analyzed by Roth-Böhtlingk \(PW, Vol. 4, p. 752\) as
puṃs\+khe ’ṭa, and explained as: “ein männlicher Planet, \(ref:\) Ind. St. 2,258,
N.” Indeed the word puṃkha is at least as old as the epics, cf. Böhtlingk, PW,
Vol. 4, p. 752, and, even though it is unattested in Vedic literature, it could
have been on the mind of the author of the CA as an exception to the rule. It is
also attested in Varāhopaniṣad \(2.82, Yogopaniṣadaḥ, p. 482\). However, this
is a late Upaniṣad, and the verse containing this word is in the meter Vasanta-
tilakā, a late classical meter. 
Whitney rightly suspects that the reading apuṃścādiṣu was corrupted
from some now-unknown original before this commentary was written. On
the other hand, his comment that this whole rule is probably an interpolation,
because the word visarjanīya is repeated again in the following rule, is not jus-
tified, since Whitney’s reading of CA 2.1.26: नकारस्य चटतवर्गेष्वघोषेष्वनूष्मपरेषु वि-
सर्जनीयः is not supported by a single manuscript. By mistake, Whitney has
taken the elaboration in the commentary to be the text of the rule.

२.१.२६. नकारस्य चटतवर्गेषु ।

E, F, J, M, Na, O: °चटवर्गेषु°. P: °चटवर्ग्रेषु°.
Translation: Before voiceless \[stops\] of the c-series, ṭ-series,
and t-series \[i.e. palatal, retroflex, or dental stops\], \[not fol-
lowed by a spirant\], the \[final\] n \[is changed to a visarjanīya,
i.e. ḥ\].
Note: As Whitney points out, this rule is uniformly applied by the
manuscripts of the ŚAV. Whitney’s further contribution lies in pointing out
that the doctrine proposed by this rule amounts to an insertion of a sibilant, and
the n is subsequently replaced by the nasalization of the preceding vowel.
Whitney offers a historical explanation: “It is sufficiently evident that this in-
sertion of a sibilant after a final n before a surd mute is no proper phonetical
process: the combination of the nasal and following non-nasal is perfectly natu-
ral and easy without the aid of a transition sound, nor can any physical expla-
nation be given of the thrusting in between them of a sibilant, which only en-
cumbers the conjunction. ... The historical rather than phonetical origin of the r
which is appended \(see rule 29 = CA 2.1.29, below\) to a few accusatives plu-
ral in the Vedic language before a vowel has been long since pointed out by
Bopp; and a kindred explanation of the conversion of ān into ān̐ before a
vowel \(see rule 27 = CA 2.1.27, below\) was added by him in his Comparative
Grammar. He has refrained from tracing the insertion of a sibilant before c and
t to the same cause, doubtless, because of the numerous instances in which the
insertion is made after a word which is not entitled by origin to a final s. But

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका291
nothing is more natural than that an insertion originally organic, but of which
the true character was forgotten, and which had come to seem merely euphonic,
should considerably extend its sphere of occurrence, and should be by degrees,
and more and more, applied to cases to which it did not historically belong.
Now a very large majority of the words ending in n are accusatives plural and
nominatives singular, to both of which cases comparative grammar clearly
shows that a final s belongs as case-ending; and I can entertain no doubt that
the whole phenomenon of the insertion of the sibilant arose from its preserva-
tion in these forms, and from the inorganic extension of the same mode of
combination, by analogy, to the much smaller classes of vocative, locative, and
verbal forms.” I have quoted Whitney’s explanation in full, because it is an
explanation which has been subsequently accepted without any challenge. In
his footnote \(1862: 86-87\), Whitney offers statistical information pertaining to
the occurrence of this type of sandhi.

suggest that these examples are from the so-called now lost genuine Śaunakīya
recension. It is absolutely unconscionable that the commentator does not offer
a single example from the text of the Atharvan to illustrate this phenomenon,
which is by no means rare in the Atharvan text. By citing the examples which
he does, he shows how deeply influenced he is by the tradition of Pāṇinian
grammar.

Translation: In words like upabaddha \[i.e. upabaddhān\], \[the
final n\], preceded by ā, \[is changed to a visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ\],
before a vowel.
Note: While the previous rule survives in the classical language, the
present rule is applicable only to Vedic language. Here, the visarjanīya is
eventually replaced with y by CA \(2.2.2\), and by CA \(2.1.21\), this y is deleted.
The other change taking place is the compensatory nasalization of the preceding
vowel by CA \(1.3.6\). Thus, the sequence upabaddhān\+iha is changed in the
Saṃhitāpāṭha to upabaddhā̃ iha. In the classical usage, this would remain upa-
baddhāniha. It is not immediately obvious why the sandhi of devān\+ca result-
ing in devāṃśca should retain the historical dimension down to the classical
usage, while the combination upabaddhān\+iti should lose that historical dimen-
sion.
As Whitney points out, “All the cases in which this loss of a final n
occurs are accusatives plural or nominatives singular, which originally pos-
sessed a final s after the n, and the loss of the n before the sibilant, with ac-
companying nasalization of the preceding vowel, and then the disappearance of
the sibilant itself, as in other cases after ā and before a vowel, are unquestiona-
bly the cause of the sandhi as it finally presents itself.” The interesting thing is
that there is no synchronic generalization of this rule to all cases with final -ān
followed by a vowel, but the phenomenon is limited to a set of defined cases.
For example, yātumān\+ayam in AV \(1.7.4\) does not change to yātumā̃ ayam.
Whitney himself notes: “The loss of the n with nasalization of the vowel is
evidently an old-style sandhi, going out of use, and no longer appearing except
sporadically. It is interesting, as regards this sandhi and that taught in the pre-
ceding rule - which have both ... the same historical origin - to note the rela-
tions of the Rik and the Atharvan usage to one another and to the practice of
the classical Sanskrit. The insertion of the s, which has become a necessary
proceeding under the modern euphonic rules, is almost universal in the Athar-
van, and comparatively rare in the Rik: the conversion of the n into anusvāra,
of which the general Sanskrit grammar knows nothing, is only infrequently
observed in the Atharvan, while it is made in the Rik with but few exceptions.”

Note: There is a slight error when Whitney says that the commentator
cites five instances. The commentary cites only four instances. However,
Whitney collects a complete list of such cases in the text of AV. The gaṇa
referred to in this CA rule is fully spelled out by the APR \(196\), and out of a
total of 76 instances listed by the APR, the CAB cites the first four in the same
order. This, in spite of Surya Kanta’s view to the contrary, indicates a very
close connection between the CAB and the APR.
One should also note that Whitney’s listing does not completely match
the listing of the gaṇa as found in the APR, and the differences between these
listings need to be further explored. All the instances listed under APR \(196\)
are covered by Whitney’s listing, but Whitney’s listing contains substantially
more instances. Below, I am listing those cases which are listed as showing a
case of this rule, which are listed by Whitney, but are not found in the listing
under APR \(196\): 1.19.3; 4.19.5; 4.19.7; 5.23.8; 6.15.1-2; 6.54.3; 6.69.2;
7.57.1; 7.65.1; 9.1.19; 10.3.14; 10.3.15; 11.9.22; 11.9.24; 13.2.5; 13.2.18;
13.2.21; 13.2.29; 14.1.45; 14.1.55; 14.2.10; 18.2.13; 18.2.18. Whitney also
lists the following instances from the 19th and the 20th Kāṇḍa of the AV,
which are completely left out of consideration by the APR \(196\): 19.6.8;
19.13.8; 19.26.3; 19.32.7; 19.36.4; 19.50.4; 19.59.2; 20.127.7; 20.128.4;
20.128.5; 20.128.8; 20.136.15. One needs to study all these instances indi-
vidually. However, at first glance, it seems plausible that the scope of the ap-
plication of this rule went on increasing even after the gaṇa was fully listed by
the APR. Such an increasing scope for this application is indeed puzzling, es-
pecially since it is not represented in the classical language. One possible rea-
son for it may be sought in the generally accepted R̥gvedic influence on the AV
tradition. As Whitney points out, this rule is applied in the “Rik with but few
exceptions,” the R̥gvedic influence may have led the AV tradition in the direc-
tion opposite to that of the classical language.

Translation: In the sequence vr̥kṣān vanāni, \[the final n
changes to a visarjanīya\] before v.
Note: The rule specifically mentions the phrase vr̥kṣān vanāni to re-
strict this change to this instance. However, as Whitney points out: “The
counter-examples \[e.g. vr̥kṣān vātaḥ and vr̥kṣān vayāḥ cited by the CAB\],
however, are fabricated: no such passages occur in the Atharvan. Nor is the
citation of vanāni in the rule necessary, although excusable enough: a v follows
vr̥kṣān in no other passage of the text, except in xii.1.51, where it is separated
from it by an avasāna, and so exercises upon it no euphonic influence.” In the
example above, the n is changed to a visarjanīya, which is subsequently de-
leted, and the preceding vowel is nasalized. This is also a type of sandhi which
is not attested in the classical language.

same manner as those coming under the preceding rules, by prescribing the
conversion of n into visarjanīya, and leaving it for rule 42 \(= CA 2.2.2\), below,
to change the latter into r.”

Note: The gaṇa referred to in this CA rule has been fully listed by the
APR \(197\), and out of a total of eight instances listed therein, the CAB quotes
the first three in the same order. Whitney points out that there are nine cases of
this rule in the text of the Atharvan. The APR lists r̥tũr anyaḥ \(AV 14.1.23\),
which is excluded in Whitney’s listing. In this case, the Whitney-Roth text
actually agrees with the APR. Whitney additionally lists 6.61.2 and 7.81.1,
which are excluded by the APR listing. It is likely that the scope of this sandhi
slightly increased after the listing of the APR was made.
२.१.३०. न समैरयन्तादीनाम् ।
Whitney \(2.30\). A, B, D: °तामित्येवमादीनाम्.
Translation: \[The change of n taught in the preceding rules
to visarjanīya or r\] does not take place in cases such as sam
airayan tām.

Note: Whitney, referring to these three examples, says: “The three
happen to be typical examples of the three principal classes of cases - verbal
forms, vocatives, and locatives - in which we should not expect to see the
sibilant inserted, since the forms did not originally end in a sibilant.” Expan-
sion of the insertion of a sibilant in these cases can then be dated to a post-AV
period. On rule CA \(2.1.26 = Whitney 2.26\), Whitney offers a ‘complete list
of exceptions’ in a footnote. The APR \(198\) follows a different strategy. In-
stead of formulating a gaṇa of exceptions, it lists cases where the final n is pre-
ceded by a short vowel and followed by t, where the n changes to a visarjanīya.
After providing a listing of such cases, the APR says: इत्यतोऽन्यत्र ह्रस्वोपधस्य
तवर्गे प्रकृत्या. This makes it difficult to directly compare Whitney’s data with
those offered by the APR.

Regarding the expression समैरयन्तादीनाम्, Whitney \(AV Transl, Vol. I.,
p. 11\) points out the ambiguity involved in the form of the citation: “The word
\(tam or tāṃ\) and its predecessor are quoted in the Prāt. \(ii.30 = CA 2.1.30\), ...
but the form of the quotation \(samairayantādīnām\) prevents our seeing whether
its authors read tā́m or tám; the comm. gives tām.”
२.१.३१. मकारस्य स्पर्शे परसस्थानः ।
Whitney \(2.31\). H, J, M, Na, P: °सःस्थानः. A, B: मकारस्पर्शे°. 
Translation: \[A final\] m, before a stop, is changed to a con-
sonant which has the same point of articulation as the following
\[stop\].
Note: In conjunction with CA \(1.4.4: आन्तर्येण वृत्तिः\), this rule changes
the final m to a nasal consonant of the same point of articulation as the follow-
ing stop. The CAB on CA \(1.4.4\) cites our present rule as an example where
the principle of maximal featural proximity enunciated in CA \(1.4.4\) must ap-
ply. Thus, the present rule changes the word-final m to ṅ, ñ, ṇ, n, or m, de-
pending upon which stop follows m. We should note that Pāṇini allows the
change of m to an anusvāra and its maintenance before any consonant as an
option to its change to a nasal homorganic with the following stop. Pāṇini also
allows the change of m to nasal ỹ, ṽ, or l̃, before y, v, and l. CA \(2.1.35\)
makes allowance for only l̃.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका297
Note: Whitney reads the ms. H: शान्तस्तान्नेदान्तःपदे तवर्गे प्रकृत्या. He is
unable to read the first half, which he suspects to be an additional citation, and
translates the second half as: “in the interior of a word, m remains unchanged
before a dental.” The manuscripts do not exactly support Whitney’s reading,
though the passage still remains largely corrupt. I suggest the following emen-
dation: शान्तस्तान्नान्तःपदे तवर्गे प्रकृत्या. I take the last portion of this passage ex-
actly in the same way as done by Whitney, i.e. अन्तःपदे तवर्गे प्रकृत्या. The first
two expressions, i.e. śāntaḥ and tānna, may be taken to illustrate the rule
2.1.31. The expression śāntaḥ, AV \(3.21.9\), illustrates the change of m to n,
with the etymology from \#śam-ta, and the expression tānna, AV \(5.18.7\),
stands for tām-na. 
Is the expression sannaṣṭena \(AV, 7.9.4\) a misinterpretation for saṃ-
nas-tena ? On sannastebhiḥ in AV \(2.35.2\), Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p.
80\) says: “All the saṃhitā-mss. make the absurd combination naṣṭébhiḥ in d,
seeming to have in mind the participle naṣṭá; SSP. retains naṣṭébhis in his text,
while ours emends to nas tebhiḥ, as given in the comment to Prāt. ii.31 \(= CA
2.1.31\).”
२.१.३२. अन्तस्थोष्मसु लोपः ।
Whitney \(2.32\). E, F, Nb: No Visarga after लोप.
Translation: Before semi-vowels and spirants, \[the word-
final m is\] deleted.
Note: After deleting the m before semi-vowels and spirants, the pre-
vious vowel is nasalized by CA \(1.3.5: नकारमकारयोर्लोपे पूर्वस्यानुनासिकः\). The
CA procedure differs from Pāṇini in that Pāṇini allows the change of m to na-
sal ỹ, ṽ, or l̃, before y, v, and l. The CA \(2.1.35\) makes allowance for only l̃.
Before any consonant, Pāṇini also allows the maintenance of an anusvāra. The
anusvāra is left out of consideration by the CA in favor of the nasalized vowel.
Whitney on this rule surveys the variegated practice of the Prātiśākhyas.

Note: Whitney is undoubtedly right in saying that this deletion of m
carries with it the nasalization of the preceding vowel. However, both the
manuscripts simply show the anusvāra where one would expect a nasal vowel.
२.१.३३. ऊष्मस्वेवान्तःपदे ।
Whitney \(2.33\). A, B, D, O: उ° for ऊ°.
Translation: Within the same word, \[the m is deleted\] only
before spirants.
Note: After the deletion of m, the preceding vowel is nasalized by
CA \(1.3.5: नकारमकारयोर्लोपे पूर्वस्यानुनासिकः\).

Note: In all the above examples, the manuscripts simply show anu-
svāras where the rule stipulates deletion of m and the subsequent nasalization
of the preceding vowels. The commentary cites only one counter-example:
pratikāmyaḥ \(AV 2.36.8\). Whitney points out: “Instances of m before r in like
position would not be hard to give - e.g. tāmradhūmrāḥ \(x.2.11\) - but it is
found before l only in root syllables, as in malimlucam \(viii.6.2\), and before v
only in the case which forms the subject of rule 37 \(= CA 2.1.37\), below.”
Whitney also appropriately points out that “this rule and the next concern mat-
ters with which the Prātiśākhya properly has no concern,” because they deal
with internal sandhis which are not altered during the transformations between
the Padapāṭha and the Saṃhitāpāṭha. 

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका299
२.१.३४. नकारस्य च ।
Whitney \(2.34\).
Translation: Also, n \[is deleted before sibilants within a
given word\].
Note: This rule, like the previous rule, also deals with what may be
strictly called an internal sandhi, which one would encounter only in the deri-
vation of a given word, rather than in transformations between the Padapāṭha
and the Saṃhitāpāṭha. In that sense, as Whitney points out, these rules exceed
the strictly defined scope of a Prātiśākhya. 
Interestingly, these rules provide us some insight into the grammatical
derivations of words as understood by the CA. For instance, this rule assumes
that a form like parũṣi is derived from parūnṣi, while the previous rule assumes
that a form like vĩśati is derived from vimśati. For instance, in the derivation of
the form parũṣi, Pāṇini starts with parus\+i. Then, P.7.1.72 \(नपुंसकस्य झलचः\)
prescribes the augment nUM, which goes after the u of parus, leading to
paruns\+i. The CA seems to assume a somewhat similar process.

pratimā́; most of the saṃhitā-mss. have pratīmā́m \(our Bs. has pratímā́m \!\!∀,

Prāt. \(ii.35 = CA 2.1.35 : so the ms.\) as the same \!that is, I presume, in the
form pratīmām∀. SPP. emends to prátī’mā́m, since, with his usual disregard of
the accent, the comm. so reads, explaining imām as referring to pr̥thivīm; our
edition has pratimā́m, with the majority of our earlier mss. The translation im-
plies práti mā́m, simply on account of superior intelligibility; doubtless the true
AV. reading is pratīmā́m.” We should note that the reading found in both the
mss. of the CAB actually agrees with Whitney’s final conclusion.

Whitney \(2.38\). A, B, D, K, P\(corr\): place Daṇḍa after स्फोटनः, and
treat the rest as a separate Sūtra. Ha, Na: °स्फोष्टनः.
Translation: \[In a stop\+stop combination\], in the reverse
order of the stop-series \[i.e. reverse of the normal order: k-
series, c-series, ṭ-series, t-series, and the p-series\], there is an
insertion of a sphoṭana \[i.e. a vocalic particle of one-eighth mora
length, between the stops\], if the first \[stop of the combination\]
occurs at the end \[of a pada\].
Note: The term sphoṭana has been discussed at length in the Note to
CA \(1.4.12: तदेव स्फोटनः\). Referring to sphoṭana, Allen \(1953: 74\) says: “This
would appear to indicate a type of svarabhakti, whether voiced or voiceless, the
infinitesimal duration of which is suggested by the specification of a value 1/8
a, in fact a minimal audible release. The mechanism of the feature referred to is
perhaps the release of the front closure during the formation but before the
completion of the back closure, resulting in the momentary outflow of an air-
stream attenuated by the back constriction.”
I agree with Whitney that the term viparyaya refers to not just ‘differ-
ence of the series,’ but to their reverse order, i.e. where a stop is followed by
another stop belonging to a series pronounced farther back on the oral track.

अध्याय २, पाद १

All the instances offered by the commentary fit this pattern: ṭ\+k, t\+k, b\+k, and
d\+g. Whitney says: “That the Hindu theory allows sphoṭana in the combina-
tion of the phrase only in the case two mutes meet in the inverse order of the
vargas to which they belong has something of arbitrariness in it, yet is not
without foundation; for it may be noted, I think, that it is perceptibly harder to
change from a contact farther forward in the mouth to one farther back, than to
make a like transfer in the contrary direction, without allowing any intervening
escape of breath or sound: and the order of the vargas follows the advance in
the mouth of the place of formation.” Allen’s explanation given above is not
very different from Whitney’s.

CAB, and that neither word is quotable from elsewhere.
For Whitney’s comment on avatkám, see the Note on CA \(1.4.12\).
Whitney criticizes the interpretation of the term pūrveṇa assumed by the
CAB. For the commentary, the term pūrva ‘previous,’ seems to mean non-
final, i.e. non-nasal. The term pūrva simply refers to the earlier member in a
consonant-cluster. The commentary seems to exclude the combinations of
nasals with non-nasals from the occurrence of sphoṭana. Whitney suggests
that these must be included, and offers the following examples: keśān\+
khādantaḥ \(AV 5.19.3\), vidvān\+gandharvaḥ \(AV 2.1.2\), and devān\+ghr̥tavatā
\(AV 3.10.11\). Whitney supports his interpretation by pointing out that “the
Vāj. Pr. makes no such exception of the nasals.”

२.१.३९. न टवर्गस्य चवर्गे कालविप्रकर्षस्त्वत्र भवति तमाहुः कर्षण

Whitney \(2.39\). A, B, D, M: न टवर्ग्रस्य चवर्ग्रे ... भवति । तमाहुः कर्षण
इति॥. P also divides the rule in the same way. Ha, Na: °र्षस्तत्र. I: 39.
Translation: There is \[no insertion of a sphoṭana\] when a
stop of the ṭ-series is followed by a stop of the c-series. How-
ever, here there is a prolongation of time \[needed to pronounce
the cluster\], and that \[prolongation\] is called karṣaṇa \[i.e. ‘drag-
ging’\].
Note: The term karṣaṇa is not met with in the phonetic literature
elsewhere. Whitney remarks: “It is easy to see the physical ground of this ex-
ception to the rule prescribing sphoṭana. The same close relationship with re-
spect to place of utterance which causes the final palatal to pass often into a lin-
gual instead of reverting to the guttural out of which it originally grew, causes
the lingual, in coming before the palatal, to virtually double it only. The trans-
fer of position of the organs is too slight and easy to necessitate the emission of
an intervening sound.” Also see Allen \(1953: 74-75\). Perhaps, the CA needs
an interpretation different from the one offered by Whitney. The extension of
duration \(kālaviprakarṣa\) in this case is explainable by referring to the fact that
the retroflex stops require the curling of one’s tongue and touching the top of
the oral cavity with the underside of the tip of the tongue. On the other hand,
the pronunciation of the palatal stops requires touching the tālu by the middle
of the tongue. Making a switch from the one to the other obviously involves a
major rearrangement of the articulatory organs. The reason that there is no
sphoṭana is that there is no discontinuity of the contact of the tongue-tip
moving from the retroflex to palatal position, and hence no intermediate release
of breath.

Whitney \(2.40\). A, B, D, Ha, J, M, Na, P: °सःस्थानो°. O: °नोपोषे.
Translation: The visarjanīya \[= ḥ\], before a voiceless \[con-
sonant\], is changed to a \[maximally similar consonant\] which
has the same point of articulation as the following \[voiceless
consonant\].
Note: This rule clearly works in conjunction with CA \(1.4.4: आन्तर्येण
वृत्तिः\) in ensuring that of all possible sounds which share the same point of arti-
culation as the following voiceless consonant, only the consonant which is
maximally similar with a visarjanīya will be substituted. The CAB on CA
\(1.4.4\) cites the present rule as an illustration for the use of the general princi-
ple of finding a substitute which is maximally similar to the original. For in-
stance, in a case like yaḥ\+ca, the possible substitutes include all the sounds
which share the same point of articulation as c, i.e. i-vowels, e, c-series, and ś.
Of all these possible substitutes, CA \(1.4.4\) will permit only ś to replace ḥ in
the above example, because ś is maximally similar to ḥ, i.e. it is voiceless and a
spirant. Thus, the above rule predicts that the ḥ becomes a jihvāmūlīya, i.e. ḫ,
before k, and kh; it becomes ś before c, ch, and ś; it becomes ṣ before ṭ, ṭh, and
ṣ; it becomes s before t, th, and s; and it becomes upadhmānīya, i.e. ẖ, before p,
and ph. 
Whitney notes that “The theory of the Prātiśākhya, however, is not at
all the practice of the manuscripts, and the latter, rather than the former, has
been followed by us in the printed text.” Other editions of the AV also follow
the same practice. Whitney points out that none of the AV manuscripts distin-
guish the jihvāmūlīya and the upadhmānīya from the visarjanīya, and approv-
ingly he says: “as we cannot but think, with much reason: since the division of
this indistinct and indefinite sound into three different kinds of indefiniteness
savors strongly of an over-refinement of analysis.” On the one hand,
Whitney’s discussion is suggestive of the distinction of phonemic versus allo-
phonic sounds as it developed later in linguistics. On the other hand, it is also
indicative of the emphasis he put on the written versus oral comprehension of

अध्याय २, पाद २
306
the text of the AV, and the fact that the texts like CA were not aimed at de-
scribing the practice of writing, but at the accurate pronunciation of the Vedic
texts. The best Vedic recitation even today distinguishes between these three
sounds, though they are not represented in the manuscripts. For a critique of
Whitney’s views, see: Allen \(1953: 50\).
While Whitney concentrated primarily on the written evidence, Allen
\(1953: 51\) offers a historical understanding which bridges the early descrip-
tions of pronunciation and the later practice of writing: “In later, though still
ancient, times there appears to have been a tendency for -ḥ to extend its usage
to contexts other than in pausa. The earliest of these extensions was to the po-
sition before the initial fricatives ś-, ṣ-, s-, where it replaced the homorganic
final -ś, -ṣ, -s \(indraś śūraḥ > indraḥ śūraḥ, etc.\). This practice was then ex-
tended to the position before the velar and labial voiceless stops: in connexion
with this innovation we find mentioned the names of Āgniveśya, Vālmīki,
Śākalya, and the Mādhyandina school, whilst the ancient grammarian Śākaṭā-
yana is quoted as holding to the more conservative practice. These changes
have been generally accepted so far as the writing of Sanskrit is concerned, and
A.H. Fry in his article ‘A Phonemic Interpretation of Visarga’ has suggested
that the spread of -ḥ was due to the writers of Classical Sanskrit ‘operating
with a phonemic orthography’. Though the term ‘orthography’ once again
begs the vexed question of writing, it is possible that this extension had a
phonological rather than a phonetic basis.” A history of the actual recitational
practice is difficult to reconstruct, though occasionally one does come across
reciters who exhibit clear differences between the pronunciation of these
sounds. Therefore, conclusions based solely on manuscript material are not an
appropriate reflection of the recitational practice. Whitney provides a detailed
survey of the views of different Prātiśākhyas in his comments.

Note: Whitney rightly says: “before k and kh it \(= visarjanīya\) be-
comes jihvāmūlīya, and, before p and ph, upadhmānīya -- these last two spi-
rants being, as already noticed, clearly implied in this rule, although nowhere
referred to by name as belonging to the scheme of spoken sounds recognized
by the treatise.” The mss. do not orthographically distinguish these two
sounds from the visarjanīya. Referring to this rule, Surya Kanta \(APR,
Introduction, p. 39\) says: “The prescription is unmistakable, and must have
been carried out by the Śaunakīyas. This is not followed by the Vulgate mss.,
which, instead, drop the visarjanīya altogether before a sibilant followed by a
surd or sonant mute, a usage sanctioned by the APr. 80. Compare Vyāsaśikṣā
156 for this against TPr. 9.1., which is ignored by the TS. mss.; thus indicating
a hopeless mixture of śākhā variations.” Here Surya Kanta is again looking for
homogeneous and authentic śākhā manuscripts. However, the kind of change
which is advocated by the CA perhaps became so outdated by the time the AV
was committed to writing, that even the Śaunakīyas may have disregarded the
explicit prescription of their own tradition under the pressure of the more cur-
rent practice of writing Sanskrit. For such a possible historical development,
see: Allen \(1953: 51\). This possibility cannot be easily discounted. By Surya
Kanta’s own admission, the APR represents a somewhat later formulation as
compared to CA, and it may have impacted the writing of the AV even in the
Śaunakīya tradition. 
The example वृक्षष्टीकते, which is not attested in a Vedic text, is found in
the KV on P.8.2.41 \(ष्टुना ष्टुः\). It is interesting to note that Surya Kanta does
not suggest that this instance belonged to the so-called genuine Śaunakīya re-
cension of the AV which is now supposedly lost.
For a discussion of related textual problems, see Lanman \(AV Transl.
Vol.II., p. 976\): “The rationale of the corruption is not hard to see: the hiatus
between c and d being once covered by the fusion of the final of jambhaya
with the ā́ of ā́ stenam, nothing was easier than to see a form jambhayās in the
first part of the combination, and then to substitute téna for the vastly less

अध्याय २, पाद २
308
common stenám or for the meaningless tenám \(which might be read out of the
combination: see Prāt. ii. 40, note\); the exigency of the meter occasioned by the
blunder with jambhayās then made the insertion of tám easy. With the Berlin
solution of the corruption, the meter is in perfect order.” For AV \(19.47.8\),
Whitney-Roth read जम्भया स्तेनं \(from assumed jambhaya ā stenam\), while the
VVRI edition reads जम्भयास्तेन तं, with the Padapāṭha: जम्भयाः । तेन । तम्.
२.२.२. स्वरे यकारः ।
Whitney \(2.41\). C: °शकारः.
Translation: Before a vowel, \[a visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ\] is
changed to y.
Note: Whitney says: “It is very hard to say whether the conversion
into y is a matter of grammatical theory only, or whether it gives account of an
actual process of phonetic transition.” For a fuller discussion of this issue, see
the Note on CA \(2.1.21\). For a survey of other Prātiśākhyas, see Whitney on
this rule.
The examples as cited in the commentary do not show this change to y,
but jump to the next stage and delete it, cf. CA \(2.1.21\).

Note: This rule, in conjunction with the preceding rule, raises some
questions about the meaning of the term ghoṣavat, and why the vowels are not
covered by this term. These same questions are also raised by the usage of this
term in other rules. For a discussion, see the Note on CA \(1.1.5\), and

Note: On the preceding rule, and its commentary, Whitney says:
“There is here another lacuna in the manuscript: immediately upon the citation
tair amitrāḥ follow tasyā agnir vatsaḥ and the other illustrations of the conver-
sion of visarjanīya preceded by an alterant vowel into r before a sonant conso-
nant, and then follow the words ghoṣavati ca, before the rule āvaḥ etc. It is
evident that the copyist has leaped over the rule ghoṣavati ca, together with its
own paraphrase, the final repetition of the preceding rule, and perhaps some of
the illustrative citations belonging to one or both of them. There is no reason

अध्याय २, पाद २

whatever to suppose that anything more than this is omitted, or that any rule is
lost altogether.” Fortunately, this lacuna is fully made up by the second manu-
script, N, now available to me. 
२.२.५. आवः करकश्च वि वरबिभरसर्वनाम्नः ।
Whitney \(2.44\). A, D, Hab, O, P: °विभर°. A, B, D: °म्नाः. Nb, Hb:
आवष्क°. P adds a daṇḍa at the end of this rule as a correction.
Translation: \[Also, the visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ, of\] āvaḥ, kaḥ,
akaḥ, ca vi vaḥ, and abibhaḥ \[is changed to r, before a vowel or
a voiced consonant\], when \[these\] are not pronominal \[expres-
sions\].
Note: As Whitney points out, “In this and the following rules, as far
as the 49th \(= CA 2.2.10\) inclusive, are treated the words whose final visar-
janīya represents an original r, and not s, and in which, accordingly, the r is
liable to reappear before a sonant initial, even though a or ā precede.” One
should note that the CA itself does not have a notion of an ‘original r.’ The
starting point of the rule for the CA is not some abstract derivational or lexical
sequence, but the expression as found in the Padapāṭha, i.e. a word as it would
appear before pause. The recitational tradition converted the so-called ‘origi-
nal’ r to a visarjanīya before pause, and then this visarjanīya became the start-
ing point for our rule. For instance, the CA does not have a rule parallel to
P.8.3.15 \(खरवसानयोर्विसर्जनीयः\) which says: “Before a voiceless consonant \(=
khaR\) or a pause \(avasāna\), an r is replaced with a visarjanīya.” The CA rule
takes off from where P.8.3.15 leaves a derivation.
Whitney also points out that there is some built-in ‘superfluity.’ The
commentary says that some instances are cited along with a few associated
words to avoid generalization and to limit the listing to these specific cases.
Whitney says that the final condition added to the rule, i.e. exclusion of pro-
nominal usages achieves the same purpose, and, therefore, there is ‘super-
fluity.’
In all the examples cited by the commentary, except AV \(6.81.3\), the
visarjanīya is not followed by either a vowel or a voiced consonant in the
Saṃhitāpāṭha. Thus, where would one see the change of visarjanīya to r? The
commentary offers examples of repetition \(parihāra\) of the word concerned
with an interposed iti. This creates an occasion for the change of visarjanīya to
r before iti. Concerning this cited repetition, Whitney makes a very significant

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका311
observation: “It will be observed that the commentator repeats each word to
which the rule applies with iti interposed, except in the last case, where the r
appears in saṃhitā. This is in accordance with the usage of the pada-text of the
Rigveda, but not with that of the Atharvan, which in no single instance per-
forms parihāra of a word ending in a riphita visarjanīya; and we must accord-
ingly regard the repetitions as taken from the krama-text, which would give
such a form to the words in question, as standing at the end of a line.” He also
points to the deviant behavior of the 20th Kāṇḍa: “Excepting in the twentieth
book, whose pada-text is shown by this and other peculiarities to be merely a
putting together of extracts from that of the Rik.” The fact that the CA does not
note the deviant behavior of the 20th Kāṇḍa probably indicates that the 20th
Kāṇḍa was added to the AV after the formation of the CA. The examples cited
by the commentary are mostly found among the examples on APR \(141\).
The CA rule lists instances which show this phenomenon neither in the
Saṃhitāpāṭha, nor in the Padapāṭha, but only in the Kramapāṭha. \[However,
we have prātar iti in the Padapāṭha for RV 4.35.7a\]. This is nowhere clearly
stated in the rule or in the commentary, but is an inference of Whitney. Un-
fortunately, I have not been able to confirm this practice with modern-day re-
citers of the AV, none of whom could recite the Krama. I have now found a
few manuscripts of the Kramapāṭha and Jaṭāpāṭha for the ŚAV, but
unfortunately not for the sections containing these instances.

Translation: \[Also, the visarjanīya of the forms\] dvāḥ and
vāḥ \[is changed to r, before a vowel or a voiced consonant\].
Note: Since these expressions are not followed by a vowel or a
voiced consonant either in the Saṃhitāpāṭha or the Padapāṭha, Whitney makes a
reasonable assumption that the citations द्वारिति द्वाः and वारिति वाः refer to the
practice of the Kramapāṭha. This is comparable with the situation of the ex-
amples of the previous rule. Thus, as with the previous rule, we must assume
that the listing here was meant to cover the practice of the Kramapāṭha.

Translation: \[The visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ, of the form\] ahāḥ \[is

if it is from the root ∀hā.

ahāḥ in AV 7.53.3\)। अजहातेरिति किमर्थम् । ‘अहा॒
अरा॑तिम्’ \(अ.वे. २.१०.७\)।
Note: Whitney suggests an alternative formulation for this rule: “An
equivalent and, one would think, preferable form for this rule would have been
harater ahāḥ, ‘ahāḥ when coming from the root har \(hr̥\).” Whitney’s sugges-
tion has the merit of brevity. The commentary of \[pseudo-\]Sāyaṇa, on AV \(6.
103.2-3, and 7.53.3\) paraphrases the form āhāḥ with root hr̥, and AV \(13.1.5\)
refers back to the form āhāḥ in \(13.1.4\) with ā ahārṣīt. Thus, all the three ex-
amples are from the root hr̥ \(harati\).
With the examples cited for this rule, it is clear that the rule applies to a
few cases in the Saṃhitāpāṭha such as AV \(6.103.2, 3\) and \(7.53.3\); and that
there is a counter-example from the Saṃhitāpāṭha, i.e. AV \(2.10.7\). The in-
stance in AV \(13.1.4\) must be assumed as a case of Kramapāṭha.
Referring to the passage ‘इ॒ह रा॒ष्ट्रमाहाः॑’ \(अ.वे. १३.१.४\)। ‘अ॒ग्निष्टदाहाः॑’
\(अ.वे. ७.५३.३\)। \(क्रम \!\) ‘अहारित्यहाः’ in the CAB, Whitney makes an impor-
tant observation: “iha rāṣṭram ā ’hāḥ \(xiii.1.4: the commentator, or the copyist,
omits to add ahār ity ahāḥ\), and agniṣ ṭad ā ’hāḥ \(vii.53.3: here is added ahār ity
ahāḥ, but it is out of place, the word not standing in pausa; perhaps the
parihāra has slipped away from its proper place after the preceding citation to
this: but then the word following ahāḥ should also have been quoted in the last
passage, and it should read agniṣ ṭad ā ’hār nirr̥teḥ\).” The kind of ill-arrange-
ment of the text of the commentary referred to by Whitney must have taken
place at a relatively early period, since it is shared by both the available manu-
scripts, H and N.
Referring to AV \(2.10.7\), Whitney says: “The comment to Prāt. ii.46
\(= CA 2.2.7\) quotes ahās in this verse as not ahār, i.e. as from hā, not hr̥” \(AV
Transl. Vol.I., p. 52\). The commentary of \[pseudo-\]Sāyaṇa also paraphrases
ahāḥ in this passage with ahāsīḥ atyākṣīḥ.

Translation: \[Also, the visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ\], belonging to a
vocative singular of \[a noun\] which has a dual form ending in -
rau, \[is changed to r, before a vowel or a voiced consonant\].
Note: Concerning the formulation of this rule, Whitney makes an
important observation: “Here, as in more than one other instance, our treatise
shows a greater readiness than the others to avail itself of the help of grammati-
cal categories in constructing its rules: all the other Prātiśākhyas laboriously
rehearse in detail, one by one, the words which are here disposed of as a class,
in one brief rule.” The procedure is also to be contrasted with Pāṇini. For
Pāṇini, it is not the case that one takes the forms of words as they would ap-
pear before pause, and then combine them by removing the pause. Certain
forms may lexically or derivationally end in r. Such r-final forms may then be
followed either by pause or by other words beginning with vowels or conso-
nants. P.8.3.15 \(खरवसानयोर्विसर्जनीयः\) says that a final r is changed to a visar-
janīya before voiceless consonants, or before pause. Thus, by exclusion, it is
left unchanged before vowels and voiced consonants. Thus, Pāṇini neither
needs, nor has, a rule which changes the word-final \(pre-pausal\) visarjanīya to
r in some cases, after removal of that pause. The construction of the Saṃhitā-
pāṭha from the Padapāṭha essentially amounts to the removal of pause between
the separated items.

Note: The example\(s\) धातर्देहि and सवितर्देहि are not found in the Vul-
gate of the ŚAV. Whitney rightly points out that पुनर्देहि belongs properly under

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका315
the next rule. Whitney first makes a suggestion: “but possibly the three
phrases form a single passage together, and are a genuine citation from some
other text.” Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 40\), carrying Whitney’s sug-
gestion forward, construes these three to be part of a single passage suggests
that this may have occurred in the genuine Śaunakīya recension of the AV, and
that the Vulgate is not the genuine Śaunakīya recension. In any case, there is
no trace of these in any known Vedic text. One finds several instances of धाता
दधातु in AV, e.g. AV \(7.17.1-3\), and it is possible that the commentator created
the example धातर्देहि from such associations. An actual instance धा॒त॒रीशा॑नः is
found in AV \(7.18.1\).

Note: Whitney observes: “The other treatises exclude the noun ánta
by defining the accent of antáḥ, and the Rik Pr. treats sváḥ in the same way -- a
method which renders necessary considerable additional limitation and expla-
nation.” For the Pāṇinian procedure, see the Note on CA \(2.2.8\).

Note: Whitney’s text for AV \(2.5.2\) does not show the change of n
to ṇ. However, he says \(AV Transl. Vol.I., 44\): “In the third interpolation, SV.
combines svàr ná and AŚS. ŚŚS. svàr ṇá; and the mss. vary between the two;
our edition reads the former with the majority of our mss.; SSP. has the latter,

संहितायामित्येव । \(क्रम \!\) ‘स्वः॒सा इति॑ स्वः॒ऽसाः’ ।
Note: The commentary points out that the full expression svarṣāḥ is
mentioned to indicate that the change of ḥ of svaḥ to r takes place here in spite
of the fact that the following consonant is a voiceless spirant. The previous
rules make this change only before vowels and voiced consonants. Then, the
commentary says that this change takes place only in the Saṃhitāpāṭha.
Whitney notes that this implies that the above change does not take place in the
Padapāṭha. Since the Padapāṭha actually separates the components svaḥ and
sāḥ from each other, the item svaḥ is in fact followed by a pause, rather than by
sāḥ. Therefore, Whitney comments: “This last is rather a gratuitous piece of
information.” Actually, the commentary is quoting not the Padapāṭha, but the
parihāra or repetition of a final word interposed with iti as it appears in the
Kramapāṭha. In the Kramapāṭha, the second time the word appears, its compo-
nents are separated from each other, but not when it appears the first time.
However, even in the first occurrence, changes like s>ṣ are restored, cf. CA
\(4.3.6: क्रमे परेण विगृह्यात्\) and the commentary CAB on this rule. Thus, in the
parihāra for svarṣāḥ, we do not get svarṣāḥ in either repetition. The first time
the word is given, svaḥ is not separated from sāḥ, and yet ḥ is not changed to r,
nor is s changed to ṣ. Thus, the comment of the CAB seems to have a proper
place, and need not be discarded following Whitney. This instance of Krama is
now attested from AV 20.11.4 in the BORI ms. 133/1879-80, folio 6.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका317
Another point one should note is that the term saṃhitā in the commen-
tary is used in the sense of Saṃhitāpāṭha, rather than its normal later meaning
of sandhi or absence of separation. In the parihāra, the word is first given as
svaḥsāḥ. Here, by classical standards, we have an occasion for sandhi, since
there is no separation of components. However, this is not the same thing as
the Saṃhitāpāṭha.

the AV, and that the Vulgate is not the genuine Śaunakīya recension. The mss.
H reads सपहो, which Whitney reported as समहो without even noting the actual
mss. reading. Now the mss. N provides a much more acceptable reading
सप्ताहो. Surya Kanta did not consult the original mss. readings while making his
claims. Whitney may have been misled by the word स॒म॒ह॒ which occurs in AV
\(5.4.10, and 5.24.1\). However, this is not a masculine word and has nothing
to do with ahar.

Translation: However, \[the visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ, of ahaḥ\] does

Note: Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 39-40\) says that the com-
bination of áhas with rūpá and rathaṃtará does not occur in the Vulgate of the
AV, and suggests that a genuinely Śaunakīya version of the AV probably
contained such examples. I believe, Whitney was correct in his suggestion: “It
is a very suspicious circumstance that a vārttika to a rule of Pāṇini’s \(viii.2.68,
ahno ruvidhau rūparātrirathantareṣūpasaṃkhyānaṃ kartavyam\) mentions the
same three exceptions which our rule gives: and it is very probable that our
treatise in this case, as in several others, has constructed its rule so as to include
all the cases noted as occurring in general usage; and hence, that the two
phrases quoted are not necessarily to be regarded as having constituted a part
of the Atharvan text for which the Prātiśākhya was composed.” This is a far
more realistic explanation. Whitney did not suggest that these were merely
“slips of memory on the part of the CA-writer,” as alleged by Surya Kanta
\(APR, Introduction, p. 39\). The reading as cited by Surya Kanta \(p. 40\), i.e.
°sāma gāyati, is not supported either by Whitney, or by mss. H and N.
२.२.१३. ऊधोऽम्नोभुवसाम् ।
Whitney \(2.52\). P: ऊध्सोम्नो°. P adds a daṇḍa after this rule as a correc-
tion.
Translation: \[The visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ,\] of \[the words\] ūdhaḥ,
amnaḥ, and bhuvaḥ \[is not changed to r\].
Notes: Whitney observes: “This rule is utterly idle in our treatise,
since no precept has been given which should in any way require or authorize
the conversion into r of the final of these words. The original form of ūdhas,

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका319
however, is ūdhar, as is clearly shown by the comparison of the kindred lan-
guages, ..., and by its treatment in the Rig-Veda; and the Rik. Pr. ... Neither of
the other treatises takes notice of it or of either of the words here associated
with it. All three, however, are noted by Pāṇini \(viii.2.70, 71\), as words which
may or may not, in Vedic use, change their final into r.” The svarādi-gaṇa
mentioned in P.1.1.37 \(स्वरादिनिपातमव्ययम्\), as given in Böhtlingk \(1887: 144\),
includes bhuvar, amnas, and amnar.
While Whitney is absolutely correct in saying that there is no rule in the
CA to authorize the change of ḥ of these words into r, the very existence of the
present rule, combined with the information given by Pāṇini, would make it
understandable that this matter did weigh on the mind of the author of the CA.
It seems that this rule may have been intended to distinguish the ŚAV recita-
tional tradition from the traditions of the other Vedas. In the larger context of
other traditions, the author of the CA assumes a possibility of the visarjanīya in
these words being changed to r, perhaps unwittingly, and the present rule sim-
ply wards off such a possibility. Clearly, the inherited texts of the AV, i.e. the
Saṃhitāpāṭha and the Padapāṭha do not show a case of the visarjanīya of any of
these words changing to r. Perhaps, the author of the CA was really concerned
with such a change happening in cases of parihāra in the Kramapāṭha, such as
would be occasioned for the word ūdhas in AV \(8.10.12\), where the word oc-
curs at the end of the line: गा॒य॒त्र्य॑भि॒धान्य॒भ्रमूधः॑. With the present rule, the author
of the CA perhaps wanted to ensure the parihāra as ऊध इत्यूधः, rather than as
ऊधरित्यूधः. If the tradition of the AV was coming under an increasing influence
of the RV tradition, then such a fear may be understandable.

Note: Surya Kanta says that the example भुवो॒ विश्वे॑षु॒ भुव॑नेषु य॒ज्ञियः॑ as a
passage cited by the CAB is not found in the Vulgate of the AV, and he \(APR,
Introduction, p. 40\) suggests that this may have occurred in the genuine
Śaunakīya recension of the AV, and that the Vulgate is not the genuine
Śaunakīya recension. Here again it is obvious that he has confused Whitney’s
statements. Whitney says that the example भुवो॒ विश्वे॑षु॒ भुव॑नेषु य॒ज्ञियः॑ is found in

अध्याय २, पाद २
320
the commentaries on Pāṇini \(8.2.70, 71\), and that the CAB gives भुवो॒ विश्वे॑षु॒
सव॑नेषु य॒ज्ञियः॑, which is not found in the AV. Now the new critical edition of the
KV \(Osmania University edn., Vol. 2, p. 927\), based on mss. evidence gives
exactly the same example as given by our commentary, and it refers it to RV
10.50.4, which is the same reference given for भुवो॒ विश्वे॑षु॒ भुव॑नेषु य॒ज्ञियः॑ by
Surya Kanta. The text of RV 10.50.4 unambiguously reads savaneṣu and not
bhuvaneṣu as cited by Surya Kanta.
२.२.१४. अकारोपधस्योकारोऽकारे ।
Whitney \(2.53\). J, M, O: आकारो°.
Translation: \[A visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ\], preceded by a, is
changed to u, before a.
Note: This rule works in conjunction with other rules. After the visa-
rjanīya is changed to u, this u is combined with the preceding a to yield an o by
CA \(3.2.22: उवर्ण ओकारः\), and then the following a is combined with the pre-
ceding o to yield an o by CA \(3.2.30: एकारौकारान्तात् पूर्वः पदादेरकारस्य\).
चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - अकारोपधस्य विसर्जनीयस्य उ\(H, N:

\(अ.वे. ५.७.७\)। ‘प॒रोऽपे॑हि मनस्पाप’ \(अ.वे. ६.४५.१\)।
Note: The CAB, or perhaps the copyists, render the rule incorrectly
by stating that the visarjanīya changes to o. That would have led to the word-
ing of the original rule to be akāropadhasya\+okāraḥ\+akāre > akāropadhasyau-
kāro ’kāre. This is not supported by any manuscript. Without noting the devi-
ant explanation of the CAB, Whitney correctly translates: “visarjanīya be-
comes u.” In fact, he cites the commentary as: akāropadhasya visarjanīyasyo
’kāro bhavati. However, this is a reading corrected by Whitney. The original
reading of both the manuscripts is given above in the text. The commentary of
Kr̥ṣṇadāsa on this rule \(= PS 267\) also correctly interprets this rule: अकारोपधस्य
विसर्गस्य उकारो भवति अकारे परे ।. 
About the text of the rule as given by the manuscript H, Whitney
comments: “This rule is much mutilated by the copyist, both in its first state-
ment \(akāro ’kāre\) and in its final repetition \(akāropadhasyokāre\), so that its
true form is only restorable from the commentator’s paraphrase. ... Evidently

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका321
the triple recurrence of the syllables kāro, kāro, kāre bothered the copyist’s
weak head, and he stumbled from the one to the other of them in an utterly
helpless manner.” It is to Whitney’s credit that, in spite of the mutilated text in
the manuscript H, he correctly guessed the proper wording of this rule, which
is now fully confirmed by the second manuscript, N. Evidently, the copyist for
the second manuscript did not have what Whitney called a “weak head,” and he
was not bothered by the triple recurrence of the syllables kāro, kāro, and kāre.
On the whole, the manuscript N presents a better state of the text of the com-
mentary and the rules. It is also chronologically slightly earlier than the manu-
script H.
२.२.१५. घोषवति च ।

Translation: \[The visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ, preceded by a, is

which combines a and u into an o.

२.२.१७. शेपहर्षणीं वन्दनेव वृक्षम् ।
Whitney \(2.56\). J, M: °वंदहनेव°.
Translation: \[The visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ, is also deleted in the ex-
pressions\] śepaharṣaṇīm \[< śepaḥ\+harṣaṇīm\] and vandane ’va
\[< vandanaḥ\+iva\].
Note: By normal rules of sandhi, the first combination would have
given us śepoharṣaṇīm and vandana\[\#\]iva.
Referring to the first of these two cases, Whitney says: “The former is a
striking case of arbitrariness in etymologizing on the part of the authors of the
pada-text, for there is neither necessity nor plausibility in treating the com-
pound as if made up of śepas and harṣaṇa: the former member is evidently
śepa, which in the Atharvan is much the more common of the two forms of
this word.” On another occasion, Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p.149\) further
adds: “The pada-reading of the last word is śepaḥ-harṣaṇīm, and Prāt ii.56 \(=
CA 2.2.17\) prescribes the loss of the visarga of śepaḥ in saṃhitā; the comment
to Prāt. iv.75\(74?\) \(= CA 4.3.2\) gives the reading thus: śepoharṣaṇīm iti śepaḥ-
harṣaṇīm; and one of our pada-mss. presents it in the same form, adding
kramakāle ‘this is the krama-reading’; and the comm. has śepoha-; but Ppp.,
śepaharṣiṇī. As śépa is as genuine and old a form as śépas, there seems to be
no good reason for the peculiar treatment of the compound.”
Whitney is clearly misguided in view of the fact that his own Index
Verborum cites \(p. 294\) no other occurrence for śepa- than the expression
śepaharṣaṇīm. On the other hand, it lists nine occurrences of śepas. This is also
confirmed by A Grammatical Word-Index to Atharvaveda, VVRI, 1963.
Thus, there is good justification for the treatment given to śepaharṣaṇīm by the
present rule.
Referring to the second case, he says: “As for the other case, of elision
of the visarjanīya before iva and contraction of the two vowels into a diph-
thong, it is equally surprising to find this one singled out to be so written, from
among the many in the text which are to be so read.” 
Whitney’s more general comments are as follows: “For the contraction
of a final syllable, ending either in an original s or m, with the following parti-

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका323
cle of comparison iva, so that the two together form but two syllables, is the
rule rather than the exception in the Atharva-Veda. Out of 59 instances in the
text, in which a final aḥ occurs before iva, there are only 13 in which the metre
shows the sandhi to be regular: in 46 cases we are to read e ’va; am iva is con-
tracted in the same manner 25 times out of 40; āḥ iva, only 4 times out of 19;
im iva, 3 times out of 5; iḥ iva, 7 times out of 10; uḥ iva, 6 times, or in every
instance the text contains; um iva, only once out of 3 times: and there are single
sporadic cases of a similar elision after the terminations eḥ, āu, ān, ad, ud,
which would pass without notice, as mere irregularities of metre, were it not
for their analogy with the others I have mentioned, but which, considering
these latter, are worth adverting to, as illustrations of the same general ten-
dency.”
A primary fact Whitney fails to mention is that the rules in the CA are
not given to account for those cases where modern scholars restore the irregu-
lar meter to its regularity by assuming that the ‘original’ text read differently
from what has been transmitted to us. The CA rules are not restorative in this
sense, but descriptive of the Saṃhitāpāṭha and the Padapāṭha as they were re-
ceived at that time.

\(7.120.2 = W: 7.115.2\) as वन्द॑नाऽइव, and offers the variant वन्द॑नःऽइव in the
footnotes. One should also note that the commentary of \[Pseudo\]-Sāyaṇa
adopts the first of these readings \(cf. वन्दना लताविशेषः\), and shows no
awareness of the reading as assumed by the CA. In this connection, it may also
be noted that, as far as my reading of \[Pseudo\]-Sāyaṇa’s commentary goes, he
shows no knowledge of the CA. This may also be explained by the fact that no
manuscript of the CA has been found to the south of Maharashtra, and that it is
likely that \{Pseudo\]-Sāyaṇa may have had no access to this text.
Whitney points to a case which he believes the Prātiśākhya should have
taken care of. This is the expression yakṣmodhām in AV \(9.8.9\). Whitney

अध्याय २, पाद २
324
\(AV Transl. Vol.II., p. 550\) says: “The pada-text reads in c yakṣmaḥ-dhā́m.
The Prāt. takes no notice of the irregular form of the first member of the com-
pound, as it does, superfluously \(ii. 56 = CA 2.2.17\), of the contrary treatment
of śepas in śepa-harṣaṇīm.” Also see the Note on CA \(3.2.12\) for more
possible examples which could have been listed under this rule.

Note: The syntax of this rule seems strange, especially coming after
the previous rule. Normally, one would have expected the force of na in the
previous rule to continue into this rule. However, the examples as given do
indeed show the deletion of a theoretically possible visarjanīya, e.g. dīrghā-
yutva < dīrghāyuḥ\+tva. Whitney notes an important point that “in all these
cases, it will be noticed, the lopa of the visarjanīya is made in the pada-text, as
well as in saṃhitā, as is directed in a later rule \(iv. 100 = CA 4.3.29:
dīrghāyutvāyādīnāṃ ca\).”

Note: It is assumed that after duḥ\+dāśa is changed to duu\+ḍāśa, the
two u vowels coalesce into a long ū, yielding the formation dūḍāśa.

दू॒ढ्यो॑ जहि’ \(ऋ.वे. १.९४.९\)।
Note: The commentary brings up an important issue by saying this
change occurs only in the Saṃhitāpāṭha. We must interpret संहितायामित्येव as
referring specifically to the Saṃhitāpāṭha, and not referring to the generic
sandhi or the lack of a pause in between the recited items. Thus, the Padapāṭha
reading duḥ / dāśe does not occasion this rule, because the components are
separated by a short pause. However, in the parihāra of the Kramapāṭha, the
word is first repeated with its components combined. Then it is followed by
iti, followed by the repetition of the word broken into its components. In the
first repetition, one would expect the normal sandhi rules to apply. Thus, we

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका327
have duḥ\+dāśa changing to durdāśa. However, since this is not the
Saṃhitāpāṭha, the present rule does not apply. The same important distinction
between sandhi versus Saṃhitāpāṭha is found in several other cases, e.g. CA
\(2.2.17\).
It should be noted that the CA appropriately limits itself to the forma-
tion dūḍāśa which is attested in the AV. However, the more generalized for-
mulation appearing in the commentary extends the same procedure to other
formations occurring elsewhere. Also note that while the generalized formula-
tion includes dūṇāśa, Whitney points out that “the Atharvan has duḥ-naśa
\(v.11.6\), but treats it according to the regular methods of combination, making
durṇaśa in saṃhitā.” Thus, the generalized formulation, introduced with apara
āha, seems to take care of dūṇāśa, which is not an Atharvan expression, and
fails to take care of durṇaśa which is an Atharvan expression. Thus, the
Vārttika-like passage cited by the commentary offers a glimpse into an
unknown \[non-Atharvan?\] grammatical text. Compare the Vārttika \(दुरो दाश-
नाशदभध्येषु\) on P.6.3.109, which is expanded by Patañjali to: दुरो दाशनाशदभ-
ध्येषूत्वं वक्तव्यमुत्तरपदादेश्च ष्टुत्वम्.
२.३.२. शुनि तकारः ।
Whitney \(2.61\). 
Translation: Before śun, \[the visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ, of duḥ\] is
changed to t.
Note: This rule helps the transition of the Padapāṭha reading duḥ /
śunā to the Saṃhitāpāṭha reading ducchunā. The initial duḥ\+śunā is changed to
dut\+śunā by this rule. Then, with the application of CA \(2.1.13: तकारस्य
शकारलकारयोः परसस्थानः\) and CA \(2.1.17: तवर्गीयाच्छकारः शकारस्य\), we finally
get ducchunā.
Since the forms ducchunām and ducchunā are not analyzed into their
components in the Padapāṭha, Whitney believes that this rule is “properly su-
perfluous, and we have a right to wonder that it was introduced into our trea-
tise.” The same sentiment is echoed by Surya Kanta \(APR, p. 142\). In my
opinion, this rule, like several others, indicates that the author of the CA occa-
sionally goes into grammatical analysis beyond the limits of the Padapāṭha,
rather than this rule being a later addition to the text. All the manuscripts have
the rule and the oldest commentary comments on it, and hence, if the rule is a
‘later’ addition, it must have taken place very early.

328अध्याय २, पाद ३
There is good reason why the Padapāṭha does not break this word
down into its components. Its etymology is elusive. Sāyaṇa on RV \(1.116.21\)
paraphrases the word with duṣṭasukha = duḥkhasya kartā, and says that the
word suna refers to happiness. However, this word is not independently
attested. Skandasvāmin paraphrases the word with durbhikṣa. Surya Kanta
\(1981: 343\) derives it as dut\+śuna, but then also seems to link it with the root
du ‘burn.’ He quotes a paraphrase as duṣṭacitta for this word occurring in TS
\(iv.6.6.7\). The denominative verb ducchunāyase in RV \(7.55.3\) is paraphrased
by Sāyaṇa with bādhase, while ducchunāyate in VS \(xix. 33\) is paraphrased
with daridraṃ karoti. Thus, this word would qualify for not being split into its
components in the Padapāṭha, because of the confusion concerning its
components, cf. sandeha in CA \(4.2.5: षोडशी सन्देहात्\). On the other hand, the
present CA rule represents an humble effort to suggest an etymology for the
word.

Note: The last counter-example, i.e. AV \(12.3.39\), cited by the com-
mentary is not directly accounted for by the CA rule. Its very presence in the
commentary suggests that either the commentator is adding something that the
author of the Sūtras unintentionally left out, or that there was a change in the
oral tradition, and that the commentator was faced with an instance which did
not occur in the text as known to the author of the Sūtras. This instance is in-
deed listed in the APR \(201\) as an exception, and it is clear that the CAB has
recorded this exception from the APR. Whitney suggests another possibility
that sequences of repeated words like paraḥ\+paraḥ were perhaps not treated as
compounds by the author of the Sūtras and hence he did not feel the need to
make provision for this instance. On the other hand, it is clear that the com-
mentator considers this an instance of compounding, and hence feels that he
must explicitly exclude this instance from the operation of the rule. In any
case, there is change in the tradition, either linguistic, theoretical, or both. Since
this last instance has been explicitly accounted for by the APR \(201, p. 120\), it
is clear that the CAB and the APR are following the same tradition, which is
slightly different from the one reflected in the CA. Also see the Note on CA
\(4.1.62\).
This rule is cited in a slightly abbreviated form in APR \(201, See:
APR, Introduction, p. 20\). However, identical examples are found under APR
\(201\) and in the CAB on the present rule.
As far as the prescription for sadyaḥkrīḥ is concerned, we should note
that the later uniform usage of the derivative sādyaskra indicates that the prohi-
bition on the change of Visarga to s in this form was not generally followed.
Sāyaṇa’s reading is sadyaskrīḥ.
On pībasphākam, Whitney says: “I would remark that its treatment by
the pada-text, and its citation under this rule, seem to depend upon a false ety-
mology, in as much as its final member is plainly not phāka, but sphāka, a
word allied with sphāna and sphāti, repeatedly met with elsewhere.” On the
same word in AV \(4.7.3\), Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p. 155\) says: “In b,
all our mss. \(as also the comment on Prāt. ii.62 = CA 2.3.3\) read pībasphākám
\(p. pībaḥ-phākám, which the comment just quoted ratifies\), as our edition

330अध्याय २, पाद ३
reads; SPP., on the other hand, prints pībaspākám \(comm. pīvaspākam, ex-
plained as ‘fat-cooking’\) and declares this to be the unanimous reading of his
authorities: this discordance of testimony is quite unexplainable. The transla-
tion implies emendation of the pada-reading to pībaḥ-sphākám.” Lanman fur-
ther adds \(ibid.\): “In a supplementary note, Roth reports: Ppp. has pivassākam;
R. has, p.m., pibaspā-, corrected to pībasphā-; T. has pīvaspā-.”
On chandaḥpakṣe in AV \(8.9.12\), Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.II., p.
509\) says: “The Pet. Lexx. give the first word in the form chā́ndaspakṣa, al-
though Prāt. ii. 62 expressly requires -aḥpa-, and all the mss. read it except Bp.,
which has -aṣpa-.”

Translation: \[The visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ, of\] niḥ, duḥ, āviḥ, and

pounding.

Note: Whitney says: “The particle duḥ never appears in the Atharvan
text except as compounded with other words, but it would seem from this rule
that the compounds which it forms are not entitled to the name samāsa.”
However, with respect to any cited form, a conclusion whether it is or it is not
a case of compound \(samāsa\) cannot be automatically be drawn, because the
condition stated in the rule, ‘even when there is no compounding,’ allows for

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका331
examples of compounds, as well as non-compounds. In general, words like
niḥ are not viewed as being compounded with finite verbs, but are viewed as
being compounded with verbal nouns. A somewhat similar distinction seems
to hold in Pāṇini’s system, cf. P.8.4.14 \(उपसर्गादसमासेऽपि णोपदेशस्य\) and
P.7.1.37 \(समासेऽनञ्पूर्वे क्त्वो ल्यप्\).
All the AV mss. used by Whitney retain the visarjanīya in निः क्र॒व्याद॑म्
\(AV 12.2.16, 42\) and निः पृ॑थि॒व्याः \(AV 16.7.6\), and so does Whitney’s edition.
Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 38\) suggests that here we have the non-
Śaunakīya readings preserved in the mss. Concerning the passage आविष्कृणुते
रूपाणि which is not attested in the AV, Surya Kanta \(ibid, p. 40\) makes a sug-
gestion that it may have occurred in the genuine Śaunakīya recension, and that
the currently available AV text is not genuinely Śaunakīya. Somehow, he does
not raise the same claim about the example duṣpītam cited by the commentary
which is also not attested in the AV. The example duṣpītam is cited by the KV
on Pāṇini \(8.3.41: इदुदुपधस्य चाप्रत्ययस्य\), and it is likely that our commentator
cited it from such a source. To illustrate the condition असमासेऽपि, the commen-
tator seems to have found examples of mostly finite verbs with the associated
words like nir. However, when it came to dur, it would seem that he was hard-
pressed to find examples of such finite verbs. Thus, he was forced to come up
with examples of non-finite forms, out of which one is attested in the AV, and
the other the commentator found in commentaries on Pāṇini. One need not
posit for this a so-called lost genuine Śaunakīya text of the AV.
The exception introduced by the commentary with the words ततोऽपवदति
is important. This exception is not directly accounted for by the CA rule, nor
has it been accounted for in the APR. This makes one suspect that the text of
the AV as known to the author of the commentary was perhaps slightly differ-
ent as compared to the text as known to the authors of the CA and the APR.
Whitney’s edition of the AV follows the statement in the commentary, but it is
not clear whether the manuscripts of the AV follow this prescription. The
VVRI edition also seems to follow the prescription as given in the commen-
tary.
Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.II., p. 698\) suggests another possibility for
आविष्कृणुते रूपाणि. For AV \(12.4.29c\), some mss. read आविष्कृणुते रूपाणि, while
others read आविष्कृणुष्व रूपाणि. Whitney says: “The translation implies in b the
reading kr̥ṇute instead of kr̥ṇuṣva, although the former is found only in
O.p.m.D.T. ∀Three of SSP’s pada-mss. have kr̥ṇute.\# The comm. to Prāt.
ii.63 quotes āviṣ kr̥ṇute rūpāṇi, which is not found in the text unless here.”
Thus there is no reason to say that this passage is not at all found in the AV.
The simplest assumption would be that the CAB knew this reading for AV

332अध्याय २, पाद ३
12.4.29c. The only other known Vedic text which uses आविष्कृणुते is Jaiminīya-
Brāhmaṇa \(3.96\), but here it does not co-occur with rūpāṇi.

Note: Whitney says: “The cases to which this rule is meant to apply
are of very different frequency of occurrence, and the rule itself is of very dif-
ferent degrees of accuracy as concerns the forms mentioned. ... Not much can
be said in praise of the way in which this rule is constructed.” While
Whitney’s frustration is understandable, one must also deal with the fact that he
is comparing the text of the AV as we know it today with the rules of the CA
which were formulated more than two thousands years ago, and we must make
allowance for change in the transmitted text, before assigning blame to the
author of the CA. This rule is especially a good example for illustrating the
possibility of such changes occurring in the transmitted text. 
Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 41\) brings up a very interesting
difference between the CA and the APR. The CAB says that the change of
visarjanīya to ṣ before kr̥ṇotu occurs only in three cases listed there. On the
other hand, the APR \(148\) refers to the same three passages and says:
कृणोत्वित्यत्र त्रिधातु सत्वं न. Surya Kanta points out that the Vulgate mss. follow
the APR, and not the CA prescription, and retain the visarjanīya in these cases.
This, to Surya Kanta, implies that the Vulgate is not a Śaunakīya text. While
not denying the facts pointed out by Surya Kanta, one can think in terms of
possible change within the same tradition over a period of time. Such a change
could have occurred even between the period of CA and that of the CAB. It is
indeed conceivable that the CA did not think of the kind of limitations sug-
gested by the CAB, but that the CAB is making a reference to a changed
situation. If such a possibility is granted, one can then think of further change
reflected in the APR. Does the APR project a reverse situation, i.e. that there
could be an s for the visarjanīya before kr̥ṇotu in all other instances, except
these three? Or does it say that in the three cases, where the CAB prescribed
the change, no such change occurs, and in these cases, we get a visarjanīya, as
we get it elsewhere before kr̥ṇotu. One would have to accept the second alter-
native, in view of the testimony of the manuscripts. Whitney says: “In all these
\(= three\) passages, however, the manuscripts read, without dissent, visarjanīya
before the k. ... Other instances in which kr̥ṇotu has an unaltered visarjanīya
before it are tolerably numerous. ... They are vi.40.1, 2; 53.3; 73.3; 83.1; 104.3;
vii.32.1; 33.1; 51.1; 91.1; viii.8.4; ix.2.7; 4.2; xi.1.6; xii.1.1, 43.” In all these

334अध्याय २, पाद ३
cases, the VVRI edition records a visarjanīya before kr̥ṇotu, and there are no
manuscript varients recorded. Thus, instead of simply talking about two differ-
ent recensions represented by these two texts, one could make a better case for
a possible historical change within the same tradition:
1\) CA - Unconditional change of visarjanīya to s before kr̥ṇotu.
2\) CAB - This change occurs only in three instances.
3\) APR - The above change does not occur in any instances.
Surya Kanta’s conceptions are based on several assumptions. The first
is that the oral \(or even written\) textual traditions, once codified by some
scholar-sage, were essentially immutable. The second assumption is that the
CAB actually forms part of the text of the original CA, and hence the examples
and everything else seen in the CAB was somehow identical with the expec-
tations of the original CA. In my opinion, both of these assumptions are seri-
ously questionable. The general direction of possible change in the language is
further supported by the following observations of W.S. Allen \(1053: 51\): “In
later, though still ancient, times there appears to have been a tendency for -ḥ to
extend its usage to contexts other than in pausa. The earliest of these exten-
sions was to the position before the initial fricatives ś-, ṣ-, s-, where it replaced
the homorganic final -ś, -ṣ, -s \(indraś śūraḥ > indraḥ śūraḥ, &c.\). This practice
was then extended to the position before the velar and labial voiceless stops: in
connexion with this innovation we find mentioned the names of Āgniveśya,
Vālmīki, Śākalya, and the Mādhyandina school, whilst the ancient grammarian
Śākaṭāyana is quoted as holding to the more conservative practice.” Allen also
refers to A.H. Fry’s view that “the spread of -ḥ was due to the writers of Clas-
sical Sanskrit operating with a phonemic orthography.” 
On the inclusion of kr̥ti in this rule, Whitney remarks: “The next word,
kr̥ti, is one which, for a double reason, has no right to a place in the rule: in the
first place, it occurs nowhere except in compounds; and secondly, it converts
into a sibilant only the preceding visarjanīya of niḥ and haviḥ, and so would be
sufficiently provided for by rule 63 \(= CA 2.3.4\), even if not adjudged to fall
under rule 62 \(= CA 2.3.3\).”
On म॒णिष्कृ॑णोतु in AV \(10.6.31\), Whitney and Lanman \(AV Transl. Vol.
II., p. 588\) point out: “According to Prāt. ii.65 \(= CA 2.3.6\), we ought to read
maṇíṣ kr̥- ; ∀this is the reading of three of SPP’s mss., but of none of W’s so
far as noted: both texts give maṇíḥ\#.”

२.३.७. ततस्परौ ब्रह्मपरे ।
Whitney \(2.66\). O: °म्ह°.
Translation: \[The visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ, of\] tataḥ \[is changed to
s\], before the word pari followed by the word brahma.
चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - तत इति विसर्जनीयस्य परौ परतः

१०.१\)। ब्रह्मण इति किमर्थम् । ‘ततः॒ परि॒ प्रजा॑तेन’
\(अ.वे. ६.८९.१\)।
Note: Whitney points out: “A similar case, in which the suffix taḥ be-
comes tas before pari, is सि॒न्धु॒तस्परि॑ \(iv.10.4 and vii.45.1\); the Prātiśākhya takes
no notice of it, if it be not intended to be included in the gaṇa with which the
section concludes \(ii. 80 = CA 2.3.21\).” This gaṇa, as we now know, is fully
listed under APR \(203, p. 121-2\), and contains 12 instances. Yet, interestingly
enough, it does not contain the instance cited above by Whitney, i.e. सि॒न्धु॒तस्परि॑. 
However, that instance could be taken care of by the next rule, i.e. CA
\(2.3.8\). The example is listed neither among the positive cases for changing
the visarjanīya to s, nor among exceptions to APR \(202, p. 120-1\). My under-
standing of the APR lists under this rule \(i.e. APR 202\) is that the list of posi-
tive examples is merely illustrative, while the list of exceptions is a complete
list. Since सि॒न्धु॒तस्परि॑ does not appear in the list of exceptions, it could have
been most likely a case of the positive change of visarjanīya to s. The fact that
there are no manuscript varients listed for this instance by any of the editions of
the AV also probably points in the same direction.
२.३.८. पञ्चम्याश्चाङ्गेभ्यः पर्यादिवर्जम् ।
Whitney \(2.67\). 
Translation: Also, \[the visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ,\] of an ablative
form \[is changed to an s, before pari\], except in aṅgebhyaḥ pari
etc.
Note: Whitney points out: “The Rik Pr. \(iv. 15\) and Vāj. Pr. \(iii. 30\)
give the additional specification that the pari must be at the end of a pāda, or
before a pause, and the addition of that restriction to our own rule would have

336अध्याय २, पाद ३
made it accurate, and obviated the necessity of the gaṇa.” Whitney records, in a
footnote, the instances and the counter-instances for this rule. Since the APR
\(202, pp. 120-1\) also contains similar lists of instances and counter-instances,
it is well worth comparing Whitney’s listing with the APR listing. Whitney’s
list of positive instances matches with the one given under APR \(202\), except
that Whitney also adds AV \(xix.39.1, 5\), and, he, for some reason, does not
think of adding सि॒न्धु॒तस्परि॑ \(AV iv.10.4 and vii.45.1\) to this list. The lists of
exceptions, have important mismatches: Whitney’s list of exceptions includes
10.7.25, 13.1.26, besides several instances from the l9th Kāṇḍa, which are not
included in the APR list. On the other hand, the APR list of exceptions in-
cludes 3.6.1, 6.89.1, 1.27.1, 4.33.6, and 9.5.6. These cases are not included in
Whitney’s list of exceptions. Thus, there are major discrepancies, suggesting
the possibility of changes in the textual transmission of the ŚAV after the com-
pletion of the APR.

Note: In a footnote on p. 109, Whitney details instances and counter-
instances for this rule. Surya Kanta wishes to use the examples cited by the
commentary and the CA rule itself to argue that the CA and the APR belong to
two different recensions of the AV. He points out \(APR, Introduction, pp. 40-
1\) that the APR \(202\) prescribes the same operation as the present rule in CA,
but in the APR the gaṇa list of exceptions begins with पुमा॑न्पुं॒सः परि॑जातः \(अ.वे.
३.६.१\), the second exception listed being प्रा॒णमङ्गे॑भ्यः॒ पर्या॒चर॑न्तम् \(अ.वे. २.३४.५\).
Why should the list of exceptions in the CA begin with the second example in
the APR list? Surya Kanta argues: “Either CA has omitted púmān puṃsáḥ, or
APR has added it afterwards. In any case the result is unmistakable. While the
APR negatives satva in the passage, CA seems to imply it, thus showing that
the two schools are different.” Surya Kanta also forgets to point out that the
first positive example of such a change offered by the commentary, i.e. कुष्ठो॑
हि॒मव॑त॒स्परि॑ is absent from the list of examples provided by the APR \(202\). This
example is from the 19th Kāṇḍa of the AV, and both the CA and the APR

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका337
rarely cite from anything beyond the first 18 Kāṇḍas. It is possible that this is
a later addition to the text of the commentary. One more possibility omitted by
Surya Kanta from consideration is that the pronunciation may have changed in
the period between the CA and the APR, making it necessary for the latter to
list or omit a passage. Such a change could have occurred within the same
school.
See the Note on the previous rule for a discussion of the example sin-
dhutas pari \(AV, iv.10.4 and vii.45.1\).

Note: The exception cited by the CAB, i.e. भूम्याः॑ पृ॒ष्ठे व॑द, is listed in
APR \(147e\). Whitney lists several more instances of this change: iv.14.2,
xi.5.10, xii.2.12, xiii.4.1, and xviii.1.61. He further points out: “The original
sibilant of divas also maintains itself before p in two other cases, viz. divas
putrau \(viii.7.20\) and divas payaḥ \(xix.44.5\). With the latter our treatise has
nothing to do: the former it lets fall, apparently, into the barathrum of the gaṇa
which closes the subject and the section \(rule 80 = CA 2.3.21\).” The rāyaspo-
ṣādigaṇa referred to in CA \(2.3.21\) is listed at length under APR \(203, pp.
121-2\), and yet it does not contain the instance दि॒वस्पु॒त्रौ. Either we must as-

पतिः॑’ \(अ.वे. १४.२.२\)।
Note: The first two instances cited in APR \(147e\) are identical with
the two exceptions referred to by the words gavām and asyāḥ in our rule, and
fully by the CAB. Whitney cites two more cases of भुव॑नस्य॒ यस्पति॑:, i.e. AV
\(13.3.7\) and AV \(19.20.2\). Then he makes an interesting remark: “One cannot
but think that a better form for the closing restriction of the rule would have
been “whenever bhuvanasya precedes.” One should also note that the word
para is used in this rule in a way different from its use in other rules, cf. CA
\(2.3.7: ततस्परौ ब्रह्मपरे\). In the present rule, in view of the known examples, the
word is interpreted as “when yaḥ is preceded by gavām or asyāḥ,” or “when

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका339
yaḥ follows gavām or asyāḥ.” In CA \(2.3.7\), brahmapare is interpreted in an
opposite way: “when the word pari is followed by the word brahma.”
२.३.१२. षष्ठ्याश्चाशच्याः ।
Whitney \(2.71\).
Translation: \[The visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ,\] genitive form,
except śacyāḥ, is also \[changed to s, before the word pati\].
Note: As Whitney points out, “the cases coming under this rule are
almost innumerable, and it would be a waste of labor to specify them in full. ...
The only exception is that which the rule mentions.” The manuscripts of the
AV do seem to follow the prohibition regarding the formation शच्याः पतिः. No
ms. records the form शच्यास्पतिः.

२.३.१३. इडायास्पदे ।
Whitney \(2.72\). P: इडायाःस्पदे.
Translation: \[The visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ,\] of the word iḍāyāḥ \[is
changed to s\] before the word pada.

Note: The counter example हस्तिन्याः पदेन cited by the CAB is also
listed under APR \(147e\). Referring to इडस्पदे in AV \(6.63.4\), Whitney \(AV
Transl. Vol.I., p. 329\) remarks that “the prescription in that rule \(= CA 2.3.13\)

340अध्याय २, पाद ३
of s as the final of only iḍāyās before pada seems a strong indication that this
verse \(= AV 6.63.4\) was not a part of the AV text as recognized by the Prāt.”
On the present rule, Whitney says: “That the rule is not so framed as to include
also the closely analogous case iḍas pade \(vi.63.4\), the only other one in the
text where an original final sibilant is preserved before pada, gives reason to
suspect that the verse containing it was not in the commentator’s Atharvan: a
suspicion which is supported by the peculiar mode of occurrence of the verse,
at the end of hymn with the subject of which it has nothing to do. It looks as if
it had been thrust in at the end of vi.63, because in the Rik text \(x. 191\) it pre-
ceded the verses of which vi.64 is composed.”
There are some curious facts which must be mentioned. The text of the
commentary repeats इडायास्पदे after citing the actual AV example इडा॑यास्प॒दम्,
before proceeding to ask the question इडाया इति किमर्थम्. This is highly un-
usual, and one wonders whether this was a misreading for an intended original
इडस्पदे. Such a suspicion is strengthened by the fact that the APR \(203, p. 121\)
actually lists the case इडस्पदे. However, it is of course possible that the example
was not part of the AV known to the CA and the CAB, and was incorporated
in it by the time of APR.
२.३.१४. पितुष्पितरि ।
Whitney \(2.73\), A, B, D, H, J, K, M, N, and P read पितुः पितरि. Other
mss. read: पितुष्पितरि.
Translation: \[The visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ,\] of the word pituḥ \[is
changed to s\] before the forms of pitr̥.
चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - पितुरिति विसर्जनीयस्य पितरि परतः
सकारो भवति । ‘यस्तानि॒ वेद॒ स पि॒तुष्पि॒तास॑त्’ \(अ.वे. २.
१.२\)। ‘यस्ता वि॑जा॒नात् स पि॒तुष्पि॒तास॑त्’ \(अ.वे. ९.९.
१५\)।
Note: Whitney’s manuscript, our H, contained only the first example,
and Whitney recorded the second one in his notes: “a similar phrase is found
once more in the text \(at ix.9.15\)”. This second example is now found in the
manuscript N. 
Whitney further says: “On the other hand, we have three cases in the
eighteenth book \(xviii.2.49; 3.46, 59\) in which pituḥ stands before pitaraḥ, and,

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका341
by the unanimous authority of the manuscripts, maintains its visarjanīya. We
must suppose either that the Prātiśākhya and its commentator overlooked these
passages, or that they did not stand in the text contemplated by them, or that
they stood there with the reading pituṣ pitaraḥ.” In all these cases, the VVRI
edition also offers a reading with the visarjanīya, and does not cite any manu-
script varients in favor of its change to ṣ. 
Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 38\) argues that such violations by
the Vulgate text of the AV of the rules of the CA should be interpreted to mean
that the Vulgate is not the Śaunakīya recension of the AV, and that the CA
must be referring to a genuinely Śaunakīya recension which we do not possess
today. 
It is curious to note that while the CAB does not explicitly note any ex-
ceptions, the APR \(147, p. 101\) lists ये नः॑ पि॒तुः पि॒तरो॒ ये पि॑ताम॒हाः, AV
\(xviii.2.49; 3.46, 59\) as an exception to the change of ḥ to s.  Since neither the
CA nor the CAB show any awareness of this exception, and since the APR
explicitly lists it as an exception, the most likely conclusion is that the text of
the AV as known to the CA and the CAB did not have this exception, but that
the exception had developed prior to the listings made by the APR.
Referring to the mss. variants regarding this phrase in AV \(9.9.15\),
Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.II., 554\) says: “Some of our mss. \(P.s.m.O.K.T.\)
read pitúḥ p- in d; we had the phrase once before, at ii.1.2, and the combination
falls under Prāt. ii.73 \(= CA 2.3.14\).”
२.३.१५. द्यौश्च ।
Whitney \(2.74\).
Translation: \[The visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ,\] of the word dyauḥ \[is\]
also \[changed to s, before a form of pitr̥\].
चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - द्यौरिति विसर्जनीयस्य पितरि परतः
सकारो भवति । ‘द्यौष्पित॑र्या॒वय॑’ \(अ.वे. ६.४.३\)।
‘द्याै॒ष्पितः॑’ \(अ.वे. ६.४.३\)। ‘न्यङ् अ॑ध॒राङ्’ \(H, N:‘न्यध-
राङ्,’\) \(अ.वे. ५.२२.२\)।
Note: Referring to the Vulgate mss. for AV \(6.4.3\), Whitney says:
“All mss., but one, retain visarjanīya.” All manuscripts, except I and H, give
dyauṣ in AV 3.9.1 and so does Whitney’s edition. However, later Whitney

342अध्याय २, पाद ३
\(AV Transl. Vol.I., p. 98\) says “SSP. reads in b dyāúḥ p-, which is doubtless
preferable to our dyāúṣ p-; it is read by the majority of his mss. and by part of
ours \(H.I.K\); Ppp. also has it.” At AV \(3.23.6, and 8.7.2\), almost all mss. re-
tain the visarjanīya, and so does Whitney’s edition. On the reading in this
verse, Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p. 128\) reports: “The first half verse is
found again later, as viii.7.2.c,d; in both places, part of the mss. read dyāúṣ p-
\(here only our O., with half of SPP’s\); and that appears to be required by Prāt.
ii-74 \(= CA 2.3.15\), although the looser relation of the two words favors in a
case like this the reading dyāúḥ, which both editions present.” Surya Kanta
\(APR, Introduction, p.38\) refers to this situation and argues that the Vulgate of
the AV is not Śaunakīya, but that there is a mixture of the Śaunakīya readings
at times in the existing mss. The example AV \(6.4.3\) is cited as example 21
under APR \(28b, p. 27\) with ṣ, rather than with the visarjanīya. The tenden-
cies in the manuscripts of the AV, in this case, seem to show a further shift
away from ṣ. Such a change is clearly more in the direction of the tendencies
reflected in the classical language. See: Allen \(1953: 51\). 
The example न्यङ् अ॑ध॒राङ् has no place here. The examples द्याै॒ष्पितः॑ \(AV
6.4.3\) and न्यङ् अ॑ध॒राङ् \(AV 5.22.2\) are cited consecutively under APR \(53, p.
43\), and it is possible that the copyist for the CAB, who may also have copied
the APR, confused the citations. This is the best explanation for why these
two otherwise unrelated examples might have been juxtaposed in the
manuscripts of the CAB. The confusion must have been fairly old to have
been found in both the manuscripts H and N.
२.३.१६. आयुष्प्रथमे ।
Whitney \(2.75\), D, H, J, M, N, and P: आयुः प्रथमे. Other mss:
आयुष्प्रथमे.
Translation: \[The visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ,\] of the word āyuḥ \[is
changed to s\], before prathama.
चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - आयुरिति विसर्जनीयस्य प्रथमे परतः
सकारो भवति । ‘आयु॑ष्प्रथ॒मं प्र॒जां पोष॑म्’ \(अ.वे.
४.३९.२\)।
Note: On this rule, Whitney says that all the AV mss. without dissent
read visarjanīya whereas the CA rule expects ṣ in the example cited by the

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका343
commentator. In this case, in his edition of the AV, Whitney disregards the
unanimous authority of the mss. and follows the CA. Surya Kanta \(APR,
Introduction, p. 38\) refers to this situation and says that Whitney’s decision is
arbitrary. However, note that the APR does not record these cases as excep-
tions to the change of visarjanīya to s, and the best guess is that the APR knew
these cases with the change. 
In Surya Kanta’s opinion, the AV mss. in this case represent a non-
Śaunakīya recension. On the cited example, Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p.
216\) says: “Our edition combines ā́yuṣ pr-, because required by Prāt. ii.75 \(=
CA 2.3.16\); but the mss., except one of SPP’s have ā́yuḥ pr-, which SPP.
retains.” Here too, the manuscripts of the AV seem to indicate a progression
toward the maintenance of the visarjanīya, cf. Allen \(1953: 51\). In this case,
the shift away from the change of visarjanīya > s > ṣ, may have begun after the
completion of the APR.
२.३.१७. प्रे मुषिजीवपरे ।
Whitney \(2.76\).
Translation: \[The visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ, of the word āyuḥ is
changed to s\] before pra, when it is followed by a form of the
verb muṣ or jīv.
चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - प्रे परतः मुषिजीवपरे आयुरिति
विसर्जनीयस्य सकारो भवति । ‘मा न॒ आयु॒ष्प्र मो॑षीः’
\(अ.वे. ८.२.१७\)। ‘दी॒र्घमायु॒ष्प्र जी॒वसे॑’ \(अ.वे. १८.२.३\)।
मुषिजीवपर इति किमर्थम्। ‘जी॒वाना॒मायुः॒ प्र ति॑र’ \(अ.वे.
१२.२.४५\)।
Note: Whitney points out that all the mss. for AV \(8.2.17 and 18.2.3\)
read āyuḥ, and he accepts this reading in his edition. Surya Kanta \(APR,
Introduction, p.38\) points out how arbitrary Whitney’s decisions generally are,
and that the manuscripts represent a non-Śaunakīya recension. The Śaunakīya
readings as defined by the CA are not always available in the existing AV
manuscripts. Regarding AV \(18.2.3\), Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.II., p. 832\)
himself says: “The Prāt. \(ii. 76 = CA 2.3.17\) distinctly requires ā́yuṣ prá to be
read in d, but of our mss. only O.s.m. \(in margin\) gives it; nearly half of SPP’s
saṃhitā-mss., however, have it, and it ought to be received as the true AV. text,

344अध्याय २, पाद ३
though both editions read ā́yuḥ.” A case such as this suggests that one needs
to carefully investigate the groupings of the manuscripts to detect slightly
divergent traditions of the transmission of the AV, and see if they are
consistent in following or not following the rules of the CA. On the whole, it
still seems that there is a general movement away from the change of visarja-
nīya > s, a direction discussed by Allen \(1953: 51\).
Since the APR \(147, p. 101\) explicitly lists AV \(12.2.45\) as an ex-
ception to the change of visarjanīya to s, as listed here by the CAB, one may
assume that the APR knew other instances as involving this change, and the
wholesale movement in the direction away from this change and toward the
maintenance of the visarjanīya can be dated after the APR.
२.३.१८. परिधिष्पतातौ ।
Whitney \(2.77\), Ha, J, K, Na: परिधिः पतातौ. Other mss: परिधिष्पतातौ.
Translation: \[The visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ,\] of paridhiḥ \[is changed
to s\] before patāti.
Note: Whitney notes: “The manuscripts are unanimous in supporting
the reading prescribed by the Prātiśākhya.” However, note that the VVRI edi-
tion notes the Paippalāda variant as परिधिः पताति. The example cited by the
commentary is not listed among exceptions to the change of visarjanīya to s by
the APR, and one may assume that the APR knew this case as involving this
change. Why the manuscript tradition should maintain this change, when in
other cases it moves in the direction of keeping the visarjanīya needs to be
explored.

Whitney \(2.78\).
Translation: \[The visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ,\] of nivataḥ \[is changed
to s\] before pr̥ṇāti.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका345
Note: Whitney notes that the reading with s is supported by all of his
manuscripts. The VVRI edition also shows no manuscript variants in this re-
spect. The example listed by the CAB is not included among the exceptions to
the change of visarjanīya to s listed by the APR, and hence one may assume
that the APR knew this example with the change to s. Again, it needs to be
investigated why this case has been resistant to the general direction of moving
toward maintaining the visarjanīya.

२.३.२०. मनस्पापे ।
Whitney \(2.79\). C, Hb, J, K, O: °स्यापे. P adds a daṇḍa after this rule
as a correction.
Translation: \[The visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ,\] of manaḥ \[is changed
to s\] before pāpa.
Note: Whitney has an important comment: “The pada-text regards
manaspāpa as a compound, writing it manaḥ-pāpa. Its separate mention by the
Prātiśākhya would seem to indicate that the latter regards the two words as in-
dependent; since, as a compound, it would fall under rule 62, and would need
no special notice. The accentuation does not help to settle the question, and the
sense is nearly as good one way as the other.” 
One may point out that the commentary of \[pseudo-\]Sāyaṇa on AV
\(6.45.1\) treats the expressions pāpa and manaḥ as separate vocatives, rather
than as parts of a compound, though the manuscripts of the Padapāṭha, without
exception, treat this expression as a compound.

346अध्याय २, पाद ३
Translation: Also, \[the visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ, occurring at the
end of the first item is changed to s before the second item\] in
\[sequences\] such as rāyaspoṣam.
चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - राय इति विसर्जनीयस्य पोषादिषु च

‘परु॑ष्परुः’ \(अ.वे. १.१२.३\)। ‘मा पि॑शा॒चं ति॒रस्क॑रः’
\(अ.वे. ४.२०.७\)।
Note: The wording of the commentary creates an impression that the
Gaṇa is simply poṣādi. However, it is clear from the cited examples that the
entire expression rāyaspoṣādi refers to the Gaṇa. The CAB here cites the first
three instances out of a total list of 12 examples found in the APR \(203\). The
examples occur in the same order. Whitney also notes a large number of cases,
which he thought were not covered by the earlier rules. Whitney’s listing has
several common instances, but several differences. The instances दि॒वस्पु॒त्रौ \(AV
8.7.20\), दि॒वस्पयः॑ \(AV 19.44.5\), and द्वि॒ष॒तस्पा॑दयामि \(AV 11.1.12, 22\) are listed
by Whitney, but are not included in the APR \(p.121\) listing. On the other
hand, the APR list includes अ॒सि॒तास्परि॑ \(AV 6.137.2\), अध॑रः॒ सस्प॑दीष्ट \(AV
7.31.1\), जा॒स्प॒त्यम् \(AV 7.73.10\), and स्वा॒दुष्किला॒यम् \(AV 18.1.48\), which are not
listed by Whitney under this rule. 
However, comparing such lists is a very difficult task, as Whitney
notes: “Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell what is the teaching of the
Prātiśākhya with regard to any such cases; we do not even know how accu-
rately it or its commentators had noticed and noted the instances which their
text contained. There is no apparent reason why the single cases noted in rules
66, 72, 77, 78, 79 should not have been left to go into the gaṇa, if a gaṇa was
to be established, and neither the accuracy nor the method of the treatise, in
dealing with this class of phenomena, is worthy of unqualified condemnation.”
Even with the addition of the APR to our understanding of the AV tradition,
things have not changed completely.

२.४.१. अत्र नाम्युपधस्य षकारः ।
Whitney \(2.81\).
Translation: Here \[i.e. in the context of the section beginning
with CA \(2.3.3: samāse sakāraḥ kapayor ...\) teaching the
change of a visarjanīya, i.e. ḥ, to s\], s is changed to ṣ, if
preceded by a nāmin \[i.e. any vowel other than a and ā\].
Note: The change of s to ṣ taught by this rule is already apparent in
the examples of a number of previous rules, e.g. CA \(2.3.4-6; 14-8; 21\). Its
scope also extends to rules which follow, e.g. CA \(2.4.3-6\). The commentary
CAB continues the words नाम्युपधस्य सकारस्य षकारः into these following rules.
As Whitney points out, this rule applies “whether the s to which the rules relate
is original, or comes from visarjanīya.” In the Prātiśākhyas, this phenomenon
is generally referred to by the term nati “bending \[= retroflexion\],” and the
vowels which condition this change are called nāmin “bender \[= retroflexing
vowel\].” Whitney translates the term nāmin as “alterant vowel.”

२.४.२. सहेः साड्भूतस्य ।
Whitney \(2.82\). C, E, F, I, O: °ड्रूपस्य. B, D, J, N: °द्भूतस्य.
Translation: \[The s\] of the root saḥ, when transformed to
sāṭ, \[is changed to ṣ\].
Note: From the examples given by the commentary, we understand
that the condition nāmyupadhasya is not relevant for this rule, and that the

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका349
change of s to ṣ takes place, even when the form sāṭ is not preceded by a nāmin
vowel, a vowel other than a and ā.
If sāḍbhūtasya in the CA rule is intended to prevent the application of
this rule to the form prasahanam, and if prasahanam is not attested in Vedic
literature, then it is clear that like Pāṇini 8.3.56 \(saheḥ sāḍaḥ saḥ\), the CA too,
consciously or unconsciously, could not dispense with the contemporary lan-
guage while framing its rules.
Whitney points out, “That sāḍbhūta means ‘when it becomes sāṭ,’ and
not ‘when it becomes sāh,’ appears from the instances amitrasāha and sātrāsāha
\(see under iii.23 = CA 3.1.23\), in which, although the vowel of the root is
lengthened, the sibilant remains unaltered.” 
Whitney also objects to the rule itself, and its location in the text: “There
is no real necessity for any such rule as this, since all the words to which the
commentary regards it as relating have precisely the same form in pada as in
saṃhitā.” A positive way of putting the same thing may be to say that this rule,
like many others, shows progress of linguistic analysis beyond the stage
represented in the Padapāṭha. The rule is a close parallel to Pāṇini 8.3.56
As for its location, Whitney says: “But there is a graver objection to the
rule than its dispensability: it is quite out of place where it stands. In the first
place, it treats of an initial s, while the treatise otherwise puts off such cases
until after all those of a final s are disposed of; and, much worse, it interrupts
the anuvr̥tti of nāmyupadhasya, which must necessarily take place from rule 81
\(= CA 2.4.1\) to those that follow; since, in the majority of the cases which it
concerns, the sibilant is preceded by long ā. Either there is here an unusual de-
gree of awkwardness and inconsistency of method on the part of the author of
the treatise, or the rule is an interpolation.” Since the rule is found in all the
manuscripts, and since the CAB comments on it, the chance of this rule being
an interpolation is drastically reduced. The question of the location of the rule,
however, cannot be easily solved. 
The problem has been resolved in Pāṇini’s grammar in an interesting
way: P.8.3.55 \(अपदान्तस्य मूर्धन्यः\) states the general conditions: “\[in the follow-
ing rules\], the words ‘of the non-word-final’ and ‘cerebral’ \[should be
continued\].” Then comes the rule P.8.3.56 \(सहेः साडः सः\): “The s of the root
sah, transformed into sāṭ, \[is changed to a cerebral ṣ\].” Then comes the rule
P.8.3.57 \(इण्कोः\): “after the sounds \[included in the shortforms\] iṆ and kU.”
The term iṆ refers to the sounds i, u, r̥, l̥, e, o, ai, au, h, y, v, r, and l. Among
other things, this list includes all the nāmin vowels referred to in CA \(2.4.1\).
The term kU refers to the consonants k, kh, g, gh, and ṅ. Thus, Pāṇini’s
system has taken care to place the condition iṇkoḥ after P.8.3.56, and avoid the

अध्याय २, पाद ४
350
problem of this condition becoming vacuous in this rule. I now doubt the
traditional view that the CA follows Pāṇini. A large portion of the CA
probably predates Pāṇini, or follows pre-Pāṇinian traditions, and Pāṇini’s
formulations seem to improve upon the inadequacies of this or a similar older
tradition.

२.४.३. तद्धिते तकारादौ ।
Whitney \(2.83\). 
Translation: Before a t-initial taddhita affix, \[the s, preceded
by a vowel other than a and ā, is changed to ṣ\].
Note: As Whitney notes, none of the other Prātiśākhyas give “a
grammatical definition of the phenomenon, like that of our treatise.” Taddhita
affixes are affixes added to nominal stems to derive secondary nominal stems.
This rule, unlike the previous rule, has a proper application within the normal
scope of a Prātiśākhya. For instance, वपु॑ष्टमे in AV \(5.5.6\) is represented as
vapuḥ-tame in the Padapāṭha. Based on such examples, we know that the
author of the AV Padapāṭha did separate certain affixes from their bases, af-
fixes which were explicitly called taddhita by Pāṇini and the CA. Compare
Pāṇini’s rule P.8.3.101 \(ह्रस्वात्तादौ तद्धिते\), which has an additional condition
hrasvāt “after a short vowel,” to prevent from this change applying after long
vowels. The CA version can dispense with such a condition, because it is
primarily concerned with examples as they appear in the ŚAV, and not with
Sanskrit at large.

२.४.४. युष्मदादेशे तैस्त्वमादिवर्जम् ।
Whitney \(2.84\).
Translation: \[The s, preceded by a vowel other than a and ā,
is changed to an ṣ\], before \[t-initial\] allomorphs \[lit. ‘substi-
tutes’\] of yuṣmat, except in passages such as tais tvam.
Note: The relevant allomorphs of yuṣmat in this context are tvam, tvā,
and te, as well as tubhyam and tava not included by Whitney. In a footnote,
Whitney lists all cases of this phenomenon he found in the text of the ŚAV.
However, he does not list the gaṇa, which forms the exceptions: “This gaṇa I
have not thought it worth while to take the trouble to fill up, deeming it of more
interest to give the complete list of the cases in which the change of the sibilant
did, rather than of those in which it did not, take place. The former are, I be-
lieve, the more numerous of the two classes.” Methodologically, of course,
Whitney’s procedure is exactly opposite of the one chosen by the CA. 
Also note that the gaṇa referred to in the above CA rule is fully listed in
the APR \(204\). The APR lists a total of 18 instances in this gaṇa, and the
CAB cites the first three instances exactly in the same order. The examples
listed in this gaṇa also include instances of tubhyam and tava, indicating that
our present rule did indeed cover these forms as well.
There are other significant differences between the listings of Whitney
and the listing given by the APR. Whitney lists अथो॒ यो म॒न्युष्टे॑ \(AV 7.74.3\) as
a positive case of change, while the list of exceptions to this change in the APR
\(p. 122\) includes this example, indicating that the APR knew this instance
without cerebralization.

Note: The manuscripts of the commentary both contain the reading
युष्मदस्मदादेशे, where the reference to asmad is clearly an error of some copyist.
Also compare P.8.3.103 \(युष्मत्तत्ततक्षुःष्वन्तःपादम्\). The condition अन्तःपादम्
“within a metrical foot” in Pāṇini eliminates certain instances, which the APR
\(p. 122\) had to explicitly list as exceptions, e.g. अद॑ब्धेभिः॒ परि॑ पाह्य॒क्तुभिः॑ । तवे-
द्विष्णो, AV \(17.1.9\). It is, however, not clear how the Pāṇinian system would
take care of many of the other examples listed in the APR as exceptions, except
through some global rules like बहुलं छन्दसि.
२.४.५. तत्तानग्रादिषु ।
Whitney \(2.85\) adds च. E, F, I, O, P\(corr\): °नग्ना°.
Translation: \[The s, preceded by a vowel other than a and ā,
is changed to ṣ\] also before tat, tān agre etc.
Note: Whitney says that the relevant forms of tat covered by this rule
“are tam, tat, and tān.” If tān is thus included by the generic reference to tat,
then what is the point of listing ‘tān agre etc’? Normally, such phrasal citations
are meant to limit a given generalization to the instances with the whole
phrases. If we thus take this reference to तानग्रे as limiting this change to those
instances of tān which are followed by agre, then some cases in the AV pose a
dilemma, e.g. अ॒ग्निष्टान॒स्मात्, AV \(18.2.28\). This case is listed by Whitney as a
case where the rule applies. The CA, perhaps, knew this case without
cerebralization, and that the present text represents an analogical extension of
cerebralization. However, since the rule refers to a Gaṇa, which is not fully
illustrated by the CAB, we cannot be certain.

Note: The CAB additionally offers a few examples which do not
strictly come under the purview of the present rule. The manuscripts actually
read duṣṭaro, while Whitney reports duṣṭano, and then comments: “The word
duṣṭara \(vi.4.1\) would seem to come properly under it, but its treatment by the
pada-texts \(it is written dustara, not duḥ-tara\) indicates, I should think, that the
Hindus regarded it as an irregular compound of duḥ and stara, from the root
star \(str̥\); hence it would fall under the next rule, or else under rule 98 \(= CA
2.4.18\).” The manuscript reading duṣṭaro looks like a conflation of duṣṭano
and duṣṭaram. The most likely intended form must be दु॒ष्ट॒नो॒ \(AV 4.7.3\), which
is split by the Padapāṭha as दु॒स्त॒नो॒ इति॑ दुःऽतनो.
२.४.६. स्तृतस्वस्वपिषु ।
Whitney \(2.86\). I have accepted Whitney’s reading against all the mss,
because each manuscript contains numerous errors. H, Nb: स्तृतः स्व°. A, B,
D, E, F, O: स्तृतस्य स्वपिषु. Na: स्तृतिः स्व°. I: स्तृतस्त्यस्वपिषु. C: स्त्रितः स्वस्वपिषु.
J, M: स्त्रितस्त्वस्वपिषु. P: स्त्रितस्यस्वपिषु.
Translation: Before str̥ta, sva, and forms of the root svap,
\[the s, preceded by a vowel other than a or ā, is changed to ṣ\].
Note: The manuscripts of the CA, and also of the AV, do not reflect
the predicted double sibilant in these forms, but the forms are read with a single
cerebral ṣ. The printed editions follow the manuscripts in this respect.
However, in the examples, as intended by the rule and the commentary,
one must assume that, after a final s has been changed to ṣ, by this rule, before
one of these forms, the initial s of these forms further undergoes cerebraliza-
tion. Whitney here notices a gap in the coverage of sandhi rules in the CA. He
points out that the rule as literally interpreted would yield the ‘barbarous and
impossible forms’ like aniṣstr̥taḥ, niṣsvā, and duṣsvapnyam, and that there is

अध्याय २, पाद ४
354
no express prescription to change the s of the roots to ṣ due to its conjunction
with an ṣ. Pāṇini 8.4.41 \(ṣṭunā ṣṭuḥ\) expressly takes care of such a situation.
However, as Whitney correctly states: “... we are compelled to look upon
aniṣṣṭr̥taḥ, niṣṣvā, and duṣṣvapnyam as the forms which the Prātiśākhya in-
tends to sanction.” Also, Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p. 370\) remarks: “The
proper readings in \(AV 6.121.1\) c are \(see note to Prāt. ii.86 = CA 2.4.6\)
duṣṣvápnyam and níṣṣva, which the mss. almost without exception abbreviate
to duṣvap- and níṣva, just as they abbreviate dattvā to datvā, or, in 2 a, rájjvām
to rájvām. SPP. here gives in his saṃhitā-text ní ṣva, with all his authorities;
our text has níḥ ṣva, with only one of ours \(O.\): doubtless the true metrical
form is níṣ ṣuvā ’smát.” 
In AV \(7.82.3\) etc., the CA rule enjoins double ṣṣ, which is not seen
in any mss. Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 39\) says that the mss. drop
the ṣ according to the APR 80. Surya Kanta argues that the mss. thus
represent a non-Śaunakīya tradition. However, it may be that even the
Śaunakīyas disregarded their own precepts, when it came to writing down the
text of their tradition, under the pressure of the contemporary practice of
writing Sanskrit, where the writing of such double ṣṣ is hardly ever practiced.
Thus, one needs to make a distinction between the original Śaunakīya precepts,
and what later happened to the transmitted text under the pressure of the latter-
day practice of Sanskrit orthography, and perhaps, pronunciation.

be sure, better suits the sense. The RV. pada-text also has \(viii.33.9\) ániḥ-

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका355
Translation: The \[initial\] s of a suffix \[is changed to ṣ\] after
a vowel other than a and ā, k, or r.
Note: There is a shift beginning with this rule to the change of an
initial s. The conditioning sounds belong to a different morpheme, and hence
we should note that the change takes place across a morpheme-boundary. Ele-
ments across such morpheme-boundaries are occasionally split by the Pada-
pāṭha, but not always so. In all the three examples cited here, the Padapāṭha
does not split the constituents.
The comparable rules in Pāṇini are P.8.3.57 \(इण्कोः\) and P.8.3.59
\(आदेशप्रत्यययोः\). While the present CA rule refers to k, rather than ka-varga, cf.
Pāṇini’s kU in P.8.3.57, the CAB renders it as kavarga, possibly under the in-
fluence of the Pāṇinian rules. Or perhaps, as Whitney suggests: “He explains
ka in the rule by kavargāt, ‘after a guttural,’ probably in view of the require-
ments of some authorities \(see under ii. 6 = CA 2.1.6\) that the k should be-
come kh before the sibilant.”

Note: Rules such as this one indicate that a transition from the origi-
nal purposes of the Prātiśākhya and Śikṣā literature to those of a general
grammar of Sanskrit has already begun. This rule deals with a kind of juncture
which is not separated even in the Padapāṭha, and hence one would not be ex-
pected to make this sandhi in the process of combining the Padas to derive the
Saṃhitāpāṭha. This juncture is purely internal.
२.४.८. स्त्रैषूयम् ।
Whitney \(2.88\).
Translation: \[The change of s to ṣ also takes place in the
form\] straiṣūyam \[< strai\+sūyam\].
Note: Whitney comments: “Why, among the words mentioned in
iv.83 \(= CA 4.3.11\), it should be singled out to be made thus the subject of a

अध्याय २, पाद ४
356
special rule, is not at all clear. The position of the rule, too, thrust in between
the two closely related rules 87 \(= CA 2.4.7\) and 89 \(= CA 2.4.9\), and dis-
turbing their connection, is in a high degree awkward, and calculated to inspire
suspicion of an interpolation.” Since all the manuscripts contain this rule in
this very position, this rule must have been a very ancient interpolation, if in-
deed it is an interpolation. 
In any case, the instance accounted for in this rule is of an exceptional
character. It is not covered by प्रत्ययसकारस्य in CA \(2.4.7\), because the s of
sūya does not belong to an affix. Similarly, it is not covered by rules like CA
\(2.4.10\), because sūyam is not preceded by an upasarga. This form would
probably be derived by P.8.3.106 \(पूर्वपदात्\), which is a nebulous rule saying
that, according to some teachers, in Vedic texts, an s, preceded by an appropri-
ate conditioning sound belonging to the preceding word, is cerebralized.

‘स्त्रैषू॑यम॒न्यत्र॒’ \(अ.वे. ६.११.३\)।
२.४.९. नलोपेऽपि ।
Whitney \(2.89\).
Translation: Even when the \[intervening\] n has been deleted,
\[the initial s of an affix, preceded by an appropriate conditioning
sound, cf. CA \(2.4.7\), is changed to cerebral ṣ\].
Note: As Whitney notes, the rule “is intended to apply to such cases
as yajũṣi, havī̃ṣi, where, by ii. 34 \(= CA 2.1.34\), there has been a loss of n be-
fore the ending si, accompanied, by i.67 \(= CA 1.3.5\), with nasalization of the
preceding vowel, when the ending itself is converted into ṣi after the alterant
vowel, although the latter is nasal.” It is to be contrasted to Pāṇini 8.3.58
\(नुम्विसर्जनीयशर्व्यवायेऽपि\). P.8.3.58, in part, says that the s of the following affix
changes to ṣ, if preceded by an appropriate conditioning sound, in spite of the
intervention of sounds like nUM \(> anusvāra\). Since the anusvāra is consid-
ered to be a consonantal nasal sound, Pāṇini thinks of its intervention in exam-
ples like yajūṃṣi. For the CA, which does not have the conception of an
anusvāra, the n is deleted, and the preceding vowel is nasalized. Therefore, it
speaks of “even after the deletion of the intervening n.” Another point brought
up this rule is the conception of the deletion as held by the CA. One may pos-
sibly infer that, according to the CA, a deletion may be considered to be like a

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका357
positive zero, whose intervention may block the operation of a rule like CA
\(2.4.7\).

Note: On this rule, Whitney says: “This rule attaches itself immedi-
ately and closely to rule 87 \(= CA 2.4.7\), from which it has been blunderingly
separated by the intrusion of rule 88 \(= CA 2.4.8\).” On the basis of the con-
tents of the rule, one feels like agreeing with Whitney. Note that the parallel
rules in Pāṇini, i.e. P.8.3.57 \(इण्कोः\), P.8.3.58 \(नुम्विसर्जनीयशर्व्यवायेऽपि\), and
P.8.3.59 \(आदेशप्रत्यययोः\), are consecutive rules. However, rule CA \(2.4.8\) must
have been a very early intrusion, since it is uniformly supported by all the
manuscripts as well as by the oldest commentary, i.e. the CAB. 
२.४.१०. उपसर्गाद्धातोः ।
Whitney \(2.90\). A, B, D: °र्ग्रा°. \!: 10.
Translation: After \[an appropriate conditioning sound, cf.
CA \(2.4.7\), at the end of a\] preverb \(= upasarga\), \[the initial s\]
of a verb root \[is changed to ṣ\].
Note: We should note that, in this case, the Padapāṭha clearly analy-
ses the forms pariṣasvajānāḥ and viṣitam into pari-sasvajānāḥ and vi-sitam.
The first occurrence of the reduplication of the root in sa\+svaj is treated here as
representing the root. Here, the counter-examples are fabricated examples, but,
as noted by Whitney, “The proper exceptions to the rule are detailed below, in
rules 102-107 \(= CA 2.4.22-27\).”

Translation: \[The initial s of a verb-root is changed to ṣ\]

reduplication.
Note: For all the examples cited by the commentator, the Padapāṭha
offers the dental s unchanged, e.g. suṣūdata : susūdata, siṣyade : sisyade. It is
not, however, clear how one would avoid double retroflexion in a case like अभि
सिष्यदे, AV \(5.5.9\). Why would rule CA \(2.4.10\) not apply to this example to
change the s of the reduplication to ṣ, as it does in the form परिषस्वजानाः? The
answer may lie in the way the Padapāṭha treats these forms. The form परिषस्व-
जानाः in AV \(1.2.3\) is represented as pari-sasvajānāḥ in the Padapāṭha, indicat-
ing this as a case of compounding. On the other hand, अभि सिष्यदे in AV
\(5.5.9\) is represented as abhi / sisyade in the Padapāṭha, indicating that these
are treated as two separate padas, and hence abhi is not an upasarga. In this
context, abhi is a preposition \(karmapravacanīya\) connected with the accusa-
tive vr̥kṣān.

Translation: \[The s of the roots\] sthā, sah, and sic, \[is
changed to ṣ after an appropriate conditioning sound, cf. CA
\(2.4.7\), in the upasarga\], even when there is an intervening
\[past-tense marker\] a.
Note: There is an interesting theoretical issue concerning the applica-
tion of this rule which has not been brought out either by the CAB or by
Whitney. For example, in the example abhyaṣṭhām, the components are
abhi\+a\+sthām. On the face of it, the rule assumes that the change of s to ṣ
takes place before the i of abhi is changed to y. CA \(2.4.7: नामिकरे-
फात्प्रत्ययसकारस्य\) does not include the sound y among the conditioning sounds
for this change, while the category of nāmin includes the sound i. On the other
hand, the conditioning sounds for this change, as listed in P.8.3.57 \(इण्कोः\), in-
clude y, besides i, in the abbreviation iṆ, cf. Padamañjarī on P.8.3.63 \(प्राक् सि-
तादड्व्यवायेऽपि\) says: अभ्यषुणोदिति । ... प्रागेव यणादेशात्षत्वम्, कृते वा यणि यकारमे-
वाश्रित्य षत्वम्. Thus, Pāṇini can afford to make the change of s to ṣ, either be-
fore or after changing abhi to abhy. On the other hand, the CA seems to expect
us to make change of s to ṣ, before changing abhi to abhy.

Note: The manuscript H presents the first sentence simply as:
स्थासहिसिचीनामकारस्य षकारो भवति । Whitney rightly felt that this was mutilated
and incomplete, and he restored the sentence as: स्थासहिसिचीनामुपसर्गस्थान्निमित्ता-
दकारव्यवायेऽपि धातुसकारस्य षकारो भवति। While this is not exactly identical with
the text as now found in the second manuscript, N, it is very close to it, and we
must admire Whitney’s acumen in restoring the missing text.
For the examples cited by the commentary, the Padapāṭha and the
printed editions offer different treatment. The example abhyaṣṭhām in AV

अध्याय २, पाद ४
360
\(10.5.36\) is represented in the Padapāṭha as two words: abhi / asthām. The
VVRI edition reads vyasahanta in AV \(3.10.12\), while it notes the manuscript
variant vyaṣahanta. The Padapāṭha splits it as: vi / asahanta. The form
abhyaṣicyanta in AV \(14.1.36\) is represented in the Padapāṭha as: abhi-
asicyanta. All the three forms are given with cerebrals in the Whitney-Roth
edition.
२.४.१३. अभ्यासव्यवायेऽपि स्थः ।
Whitney \(2.93\).
Translation: Even with the intervention of a reduplication,
\[the s\] of sthā \[is changed to ṣ, after an appropriate conditioning
sound, cf. CA \(2.4.7\), in the preverb \(upasarga\)\]. 
Note: In the examples cited by the commentary, the Padapāṭha
restores the ‘original’ dental sibilant, e.g. vi taṣṭhire : vi / tasthire.

९.१०.१९\)।
Note: Whitney’s text for AV \(9.10.19\) does not show the application
of this rule, but reads: vi tasthe. Whitney says that this was given erroneously
and that there is manuscript evidence to support the reading vi taṣṭhe. This
reading is also supported by the VVRI edition, AV \(9.15.19 = W: 9.10.19\).
Whitney further points out: “We have in two other passages \(ix.9.2,
xiv.2.9\) adhi tasthuḥ \(not taṣṭhuḥ\); this apparently constitutes an exception to
the rule which has escaped the notice both of the treatise and of the commenta-
tor : possibly, however, the adhi is not in these passages regarded as standing
in the relation of upasarga to the root sthā, since it does, in fact, belong rather,
in a prepositional relation, to preceding ablative cases, than to the verbal form
as its prefix : and this is the more clearly indicated by its retaining its independ-
ent accent before the accented verb.” The VVRI edition agrees with Whitney’s
reading, and cites no manuscript variants. It is just not clear what ablative
cases Whitney is referring to in the cited examples. The preposition \(कर्मप्रवच-
नीय\) adhi in both instances seems to echo the locatives in the context: यत्रे॒मा

Translation: \[The initial s of sthā is changed to ṣ\] after

Note: The CAB does not explicitly continue the word sthaḥ from the
previous rule, though all the examples it cites are examples of the root sthā, and
it makes eminent sense to continue the word into this rule. It may be noted that
all the examples of the paramādi gaṇa listed under APR \(205, pp. 122-3\) in-
volve the element stha. There are two instances included here which actually
involve the superlative affix -iṣṭha, but seem to have been evidently wrongly
etymologized as involving stha, i.e. śreṣṭha and prathiṣṭha. These two words
are not analyzed by the Padapāṭha. However, in all the examples cited by the
CAB, the Padapāṭha analyses the components, and reduces the ṣ to s, e.g.
parameṣṭhī : parame-sthī.

Note: The gaṇa referred to in this CA rule is fully listed in the APR
\(205\). It contains a total of 9 instances, of which the CAB lists the first three
instances in the same order. One should also note an interesting fact that the
CA rule contains the exception: अनापाके, which allows the exclusion of the ex-
ample आ॒पा॒के॒स्थाः प्र॑हा॒सिनः॑. The APR \(200\), on the other hand, does not contain
any such explicit statement of exception, but perhaps excludes the above exam-
ple simply by not listing it. However, one must say that rule APR \(200:
अनुपसर्गात्षकारः\) would apply in this case, and one should have had a list of ex-
ceptions. One may possibly make a guess that the original CA notion of such
gaṇas was more like the notion of ākr̥tigaṇas in the Pāṇinian system, and there-
fore, one needed exceptions like अनापाके included. Once full listings of gaṇas

अध्याय २, पाद ४
362
were made, the need for stating such exceptions diminished. One needs ex-
ceptions stated, only when one does not have full lists of instances, and has
only generic rules. The examples bhuvaneṣṭhāḥ, madhyameṣṭhāḥ, and aṅge-
ṣṭhāḥ occur in the same order as examples 114-116 under APR \(79\). 
The VVRI edition, which is basically a reprint of the SSP edition, reads
AV \(8.6.14\): आ॒पा॒के॒ष्ठाः प्र॑हा॒सिनः॑, while it lists the reading approved by the CA,
आ॒पा॒के॒स्थाः प्र॑हा॒सिनः॑, as a manuscript variant. Most likely this is a case of the
spread of retroflexion to examples where it did not occur in an earlier period.
Whitney’s reading matches what is approved by the CA, but one cannot be
certain whether he was influenced by the CA in the choice of his reading.
Criticizing SSP., Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.II., p. 496\) says: “In \(AV 8.6.14\)c,
he \(= SSP.\) adopts āpākeṣṭhā́s, with a small minority of his mss., and directly
against Prāt. ii.94 \(= 2.4.14\), which prescribes -sthā́s.”
२.४.१५. अपसव्याभ्यां च ।
Whitney \(2.95\).
Translation: Also after apa and savya, \[the s of sthā is
changed to ṣ\].
Note: As Whitney notes, in these cases “the change takes place ir-
regularly after a, instead of after an alterant vowel.” The Padapāṭha does not
analyze the components of apāṣṭhāt, AV \(4.6.5\), and does not reduce the cere-
bral sibilant to dental, but it does analyze savyaṣṭhāḥ, AV \(8.8.23\) into savya-
sthāḥ. Pāṇini 8.3.97 \(अम्बाम्बगोभूमिसव्यापद्वित्रिकुशेकुशङ्क्वङ्गुमञ्जिपुञ्जिपरमेबर्हिर्दि-
व्यग्निभ्यः स्थः\) lumps apa and savya along with parame, and several others. This
rule allows the formations ambaṣṭha and āmbaṣṭha which also lack phonologi-
cal motivation for this change. Pāṇini also has a special rule to account for an
equally exceptional praṣṭha, cf. P.8.3.92 \(प्रष्ठोऽग्रगामिनि\).

Note: On apāṣṭhāt in AV \(4.6.5\), Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p.

doubtless correctly”.

२.४.१६. अग्नेः स्तोमसोमयोः ।
Whitney \(2.96\). A, B, D, E, Ha, J, M, Na, P: अग्नेस्तो°. F, O: अग्ने-
स्तोमयोः. 
Translation: \[The s\] of stoma and soma \[is changed to ṣ\]
after agni.
Note: These cases are covered by a closely similar rule in Pāṇini:
P.8.3.82 \(अग्नेः स्तुत्स्तोमसोमाः\). However, while the form agniṣṭomena, AV \(9.6.
40\), is reduced in the Padapāṭha to agni-stomena, the form agnīṣomau, AV \(8.
9.14\) is not so analyzed. 
Whitney also points out agniṣvāttaḥ, AV \(18.3.44: Pada: agni-svāttaḥ\),
which he says should have been included in this rule: “We can hardly suppose
that it was intentionally omitted here, to be included in the gaṇa of rule 98 \[=
CA 2.4.18\], below: either it must have been overlooked by the maker of the
treatise, or the verse which contains it was not in his Atharvaveda : that it was,
however, contained in the text recognized by the commentator, is shown by the
fact that he several times \(under i.80 = CA 1.3.18; i.84 = CA 1.3.22; and ii.34
= CA 2.1.34\) cites the phrase atto havīṃṣi, which forms part of its second
line.”
Whitney’s inference may not be so cogent, especially because the par-
allel rule in Pāṇini, i.e. P.8.3.82, also excludes the consideration of this form.
Secondly, the APR \(206, pp. 123-4\) precisely does what Whitney considers to
be most unlikely, namely it lists this example among a gaṇa, which begins with
tri, the gaṇa which is referred to in CA \(2.4.18\). One may assume that the CA
also intended this example to be included in this gaṇa.

Note: Pāṇini 8.3.107 \(सुञः\) is identical with CA \(2.4.17\). Pāṇini’s
rule 8.3.107 comes immediately after P.8.3.106 \(पूर्वपदात्\), which says that a
change like the one taught by the present rule takes place after the conditioning
sound in a preceding word, i.e. पूर्वपदात्.  This is also made explicit in APR
\(206: पूर्वपदात् षकारः\), which precedes APR \(207a\) which deals with the exam-
ples covered by the present rule. All the examples offered by the CAB are
found listed in the same order under APR \(207a, p. 124\).

Note: Whitney misses the example पर्यू षु which is found in both the
manuscripts. On anya ū ṣu \(AV 18.1.16\), Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.II., p.
819\) remarks: “RV. x.10.14 has for a the much better version anyám ū ṣú
tváṃ. ... Our D., and a single ms. of SPP’s \(with the comm.\), also have anyam
∀at the beginning\#, and SPP. accordingly admits anyám into his text, in spite of
the absence of tvám. But the comment on the Prāt. three times \(under ii.97 =
CA 2.4.17; iii.4 = CA 3.1.4; vi.98 = CA 4.3.27\) reads anya ū ṣu, and it cannot
well be questioned that this is the true text of our AV.”

Whitney \(2.98\). A, Hac, Nc: त्रा°. P: आदिभ्यः corrected to त्र्यादिभ्यः.

such as tri \[is changed to ṣ\].
Note: The examples cited by the commentary to illustrate this rule are
analyzed by the Padapāṭha into their components and are presented with their
original form without the cerebral sibilant, e.g. triṣaptāḥ : tri-saptāḥ.

Note: Referring to the expression tryādi, Whitney says: “Here is an-
other of those convenient gaṇas, set as a catch-all for whatever cases may not
have been otherwise provided for, and rendering it impossible for us to ascer-
tain the precise degree of accuracy with which the authors of the treatise ex-
amined and excerpted their text.” Now, the gaṇa referred to in this CA rule is
fully listed in APR \(206\). It contains a total of 16 instances, out of which the
CAB quotes the first three instances exactly in the same order. Also see the
Note under CA 2.4.16.
Whitney further says: “He \(= commentator\) also, in his paraphrase,
limits the application of the rule to cases of this character, in which an alterant
vowel at the end of the first member of a compound comes before an initial s of
the following member.” The commentator simply says त्र्यादिभ्यः पूर्वपदेभ्यः, and
makes no explicit reference to the nāmin vowels at the end of these words. It
is, true, however, that all the cited examples fit Whitney’s description. But the
examples listed in this gaṇa under APR \(206, pp. 123-4\) are not examples of
compounds. They contain a number of phrasal sequences, e.g. नि ष ही॑यताम्,
AV \(8.4.10\).
Whitney offers a number of cases which might potentially become
members of this class. Whitney’s listing overlaps with the listing of this gaṇa,
as found under APR \(206, pp. 123-4\). As noted above, the gaṇa under APR
\(206\) contains several phrasal sequences, while Whitney’s listing includes only
compound expressions. The APR gaṇa contains the following compound
expressions, not covered by Whitney’s listing: gaviṣṭhiram \(4.29.5\), viṣāsahiḥ
\(1.29.6\), abhimātiṣāhaḥ \(4.32.4\), and agniṣvāttāḥ \(18.3.44\). It additionally
contains the phrasal sequences ni ṣa hīyatām \(8.4.10\) and hi ṣmā \(18.1.33\).
On the other hand, Whitney lists the following compounds, which are not
listed under APR \(206\): suṣṭuti \(6.1.3\), suṣūman \(7.46.2\), anuṣṭup \(8.9.14\),
triṣṭup \(8.9.14\), traiṣṭubha \(9.10.1\), and diviṣṭambhaḥ \(19.32.7\).

Translation: \[The s of the root sad is changed to ṣ\] also after
barhi, pathi, apsu, divi, and pr̥thivi.
Note: Whitney comments: “We have reason to be surprised that the
root sad is treated in this manner, being made the subject of these two separate
rules. If the compounds into which it enters as final member are to be excepted
from the general gaṇa of rule 98 \(= CA 2.4.18\), we should expect to find it
directed that the s of sad should always be lingualized after an alterant vowel,
as is actually the case. Not only is there, by the method adopted, a loss of that
brevity which treatises of the sūtra class are wont to aim at almost as their chief
object, but there is also a loss of completeness : the only remaining compound
of sad of this class, suṣad \(e.g. ii.36.4\), is left out, to be provided for in the
general gaṇa. Or is it possible that su is regarded as falling under rule 90 \(=
CA 2.4.10\), as if a proper upasarga or preposition? If so, the forms into which
it enters would be sufficiently provided for; since, excepting in the cases noted
in the later rule \(102 = CA 2.4.22 etc.\), it always lingualizes the initial s of a
root, while it has no effect upon that of a preposition or adverb, as in susaha
\(vi.64.3 : p. su-saha\) and the numerous compounds in which it is followed by
sam, as susaṃrabdha.” There is no exactly parallel rule or rules in Pāṇini
which deals specifically with the formations involving the root sad.
We may note that no forms of sad are noted in the gaṇa under APR
\(206\), which is probably the same gaṇa as referred to by the term tryādi in CA
\(2.4.18\). Whitney’s discussion regarding the status of su needs an extensive
consideration. For a parallel discussion, see the KV on P.8.3.88 \(सुविनिर्दुर्भ्यः\)
and P.8.3.98 \(सुषामादिषु च\).

‘वि॒मुचो॒ हि सन्ति॑’ \(अ.वे. ६.११२.३\)।
Note: What is the source of this exception referred to in the passage
ततोऽपवदति । वि॒मुचो॒ हि सन्ति॑ in the CAB? APR? This could be a case of the
author of the CA inadvertently forgetting to mention an exception, or a case of
textual change. In this case, the manuscripts of the AV do follow this excep-
tion, and Whitney as well as the VVRI edition read वि॒मुचो॒ हि सन्ति॑. One, how-
ever, cannot be certain that this was the reading known to the CA.
Referring to the preceding section, Whitney makes the following gen-
eral comments: “But there are still left in the Atharvan text a few instances of
the same conversion, which can hardly be regarded as included in any of the
preceding rules, since they are analogous with none of the other cases there
treated of: unless something has been lost from this final section of the chapter

अध्याय २, पाद ४
368
- of which there are no indications - the treatise-makers and their commentator
must lie under the imputation of having been careless enough to overlook them.
The passages referred to are as follows: आदु॑ ष्टे॒नम् \(iv.3.4\), तमु॑ ष्टुहि॒ \(vi.1.2\), नि
ष ही॑यताम् \(viii.4.10\), and चि॒द्धि ष्मा॑ \(xviii.1.33\). There would be little plausibil-
ity in a claim that the verses containing these passages were not included in the
Atharvaveda accepted by the school to which the treatise belonged, or that the
readings of the school were different.” 
Now we find that the last two of the examples are mentioned in the
tryādi gaṇa, which is referred to in CA \(2.4.18\), and is extensively listed under
APR \(206, pp. 123-4\). Besides this, Whitney’s assumption that the CAB was
expected to give complete lists of all examples and counter-examples found in
the text of the ŚAV is baseless. Even in the APR, it appears that lists of posi-
tive examples are not complete catalogues, while the lists of exceptions are so.
In contrast, the CAB is almost always illustrative, rather than exhaustive.
२.४.२२. न सृपिसृजिस्पृशिस्फूर्जिस्वरतिस्मरतीनाम् ।
Whitney \(2.102\). Ha, Na: °स्पृषि°. J, M: °स्यूर्जि°. E \(corr\):
°मृशि° for °स्पृशि°. F \(corr\): omits सृजि.
Translation: Not, \[however, the s\] of the roots sr̥p, sr̥j, spr̥ś,
sphūrj, svr̥, and smr̥. 
Note: Whitney makes the following comment: “This is evidently a
rule of kindred sphere with rule 106 \(= CA 2.4.26\), below, and the two might
well enough have been combined into one, which should teach that a root con-
taining a r, either semivowel or vowel, was not liable to the changes prescribed
in this section.” However, from the behavior of the treatise, one may infer that
the CA does not intend to cover the consonantal and the vocalic r under a
common generalization. This suspicion is further strengthened by the separate
mention of r̥ and r in one and the same rule, e.g. CA \(3.4.1: ऋवर्णरेफषकारेभ्यः
समानपदे नो णः\). Pāṇini 8.3.110 \(न रपरसृपिसृजिस्पृशिसवनादीनाम्\) also separately
refers to roots containing consonantal and vocalic r.
Whitney further says: “As so stated, it would require the notice of but a
single exception, vi ṣphurat \(vi.56.1 and x.4.8\). As the rules now stand, they
are slightly inexact, for in neither of them are included anusphuram \(i.2.3\),
atisara \(v.8.2 etc.\), and pratisara \(e.g. ii.11.2\), although other forms of the root
sar are contemplated in rule 106 \(= CA 2.4.26\).” 
Again, we now find that the instances of atisara \(v.8.2 etc.\), and prati-
sara \(e.g. ii.11.2\) are listed in the gosanyādi gaṇa referred to in the next rule,

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका369
CA \(2.4.23\), and fully listed under APR \(147f, p. 101\). As for anusphuram
\(1.2.3\) mentioned by Whitney as an exception to cerebralization, the VVRI
edition notes several manuscripts which have the reading anuṣphuram. Fur-
ther, the absence of anusphuram in the gosanyādi gaṇa listed exhaustively
under APR \(147f, p. 101\) may be taken as an indication that the APR also
knew the form as anuṣphuram, rather than as anusphuram. On the other hand,
P.8.3.76 \(स्फुरतिस्फुलत्योर्निर्निविभ्यः\) says that after nir, ni, and vi, the s of sphurati
and sphulati is optionally \(or ‘preferably’ a la Kiparsky\) changed to ṣ. The tra-
dition understands this rule in such a way, that without this rule, there would
be no cerebral ṣ in any forms of these roots: एतयोरपि पूर्ववदप्राप्त एव मूर्धन्यो
विधीयते, Nyāsa on KV on P.8.3.76. This would predict the form anusphuram.
One could conceivably argue that a more original AV form anuṣphuram was
reduced to anusphuram under the pressure of the Pāṇinian tradition.

\(147g: रपरसृपिसृजिस्पृशिस्पृहिस्फूर्जिस्वरतिस्मरतीनां च\) looks like a combination of the
CA rule and the Pāṇinian rule. All the examples cited by the CAB are found in
the same order in APR \(147g\). We must also note that the APR readings of
the examples support Whitney’s conjecture that vispr̥śaḥ of the mss. is a cor-
ruption for uparispr̥śaḥ.

\(147f, p. 101-102\) where the examples cited by the CAB appear in the same

that the membership of such gaṇas as mentioned in the CA was necessarily
identical with the gaṇas as listed in the APR. For example, the gosanyādigaṇa
as listed under APR \(147f, p. 101\) also includes the examples adhi skanda
\(5.25.8\) and abhi skandam \(5.14.11\), while the CA provides the next rule to

see the Note on CA \(2.4.23\).
Whitney notes, “As counter-instance, the commentator brings forward

mentator’s grammatical system derives skandha, ‘shoulder,’ from the root
skand. An actual example of the kind he seeks to give is pariṣkanda \(xv.2.1

Whitney’s suspicion that, for the commentator, the word skandha in
viṣkandha may have been derived from the root skand finds support in
\[pseudo-\]Sāyaṇa’ commentary on the word viṣkandham in AV \(1.16.3\):

८.३.७३\) इति षत्वम् । व्यत्ययेन धकारः.
We should note that on pariṣkanda, the VVRI edition notes that a sub-
stantial number of manuscripts have the reading pariskanda. Apparently, the
northwestern form was cerebralized, while the central and the eastern form was
non-cerebralized, according to Pāṇini, cf. P.8.3.74 \(परेश्च\) and P.8.3.75 \(परि-
स्कन्दः प्राच्यभरतेषु\). 
२.४.२५. परेः स्तृणातेः ।
Whitney \(2.105\). All mss read परेस्तृणातेः. However, I agree with
Whitney’s addition of the Visarga.
Translation: \[The s\] of the root str̥, after pari, \[is not
changed to ṣ\].

Note: On the counter-example offered by the commentator, Whitney
remarks: “As counter-example, he can find only viṣṭārījātaḥ \(iv.34.1\). Viṣṭārin
doubtless comes from the root star; yet, as the pada-text does not analyze it, but
writes it in its saṃhitā form, it might have been neglected, and the root star
added to those rehearsed in rule 102 \(= CA 2.4.22\), with which it evidently
belongs.”

Note: Rules CA \(2.4.22\) and the present rule together provide a large
class of exceptions to the roots whose initial s changes to ṣ after an appropriate
conditioning sound. The common factor shared by these roots is that they
contain, after their initial s, either a vocalic or a consonantal r. A similar
grouping of roots resistant to cerebralization is found in Pāṇini 8.3.110 \(न रपर-
सृपिसृजिस्पृशिस्पृहिसवनादीनाम्\). Also see the Note on CA \(2.4.22\).

Note: For the citation from AV \(7.93.1\), all the mss., except W, used
by Whitney read ṣyāma and this reading, violating the present rule in the CA, is
chosen by Whitney in his edition. Later Whitney changed his mind. He \(AV
Transl. Vol.I., p. 456\) remarks: “Most of the saṃhitā-mss. give ṣyāma \(our
W.O., and two fifths of SPP’s authorities, sy-\), and both printed texts read it;
but the Prāt. \(ii.107 = CA 2.4.27\) expressly requires syāma, and that accord-
ingly should be the accepted text.” Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 38-39\)
points out that Lindenau again reversed the reading to fit it with the CA pre-
scription, but that the mss. reading probably represents the non-Śaunakīya re-
cension of the AV. On AV \(13.1.22\), Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.II., p. 714\)
points out that “M.p.m. ∀and SPP’s C.\# read at end syāma; the passage is
quoted as an instance of -ṣy- in the comm. to Prāt. ii. 107 \(= CA 2.4.27\).”

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका373
With respect to the variation in AV \(7.93.1\), it is more likely that the situation
as seen in the majority of the manuscripts represents an analogical spread of
retroflexion in later times. It is non-Śaunakīya only in the sense that it does not
represent the situation as codified by the CA. However, one must not preclude
the possibility of change within the Śaunakīya oral tradition, as is done by
Surya Kanta. The VVRI edition offers the reading अ॒भि ष्या॑म पृतन्य॒तः for AV
\(7.98.1 = W: 7.93.1\), but notes the reading अ॒भि स्या॑म पृतन्य॒तः as a manuscript
variant. It would probably be reasonable to assume that there was further
spread of retroflexion after the period of the CA, and such a spread accounts
for the retroflexion seen in such instances.
Secondly, this rule again brings into sharp focus the possibility that the
gaṇas such as the gosanyādigaṇa referred to in CA \(2.4.23\) and APR \(147f, p.
101-2\) may have had different composition in the two traditions. While the
instance abhi syāma pr̥tanyataḥ appears in the list of the gosanyādigaṇa in the
APR, its separate treatment by the CA may indicate that the gosanyādigaṇa as
conceived by the CA was a smaller collection of exceptions. For another
similar case, see the Note on CA \(2.4.23\).

३.१.१. सहावाडन्ते दीर्घः ।
Whitney \(3.1\).
Translation: Before \[a form of\] the root sah, ending in āṭ,
\[the preceding vowel\] becomes long.
Note: As Whitney notes, the qualification āḍ-anta ‘ending in āṭ’ in
this rule achieves the same goal as achieved by the qualification sāḍbhūtasya in
CA \(2.4.2\). Whitney says: “It would not do to say ‘before sah when it be-
comes sāh,’ because of the words amitrasāha and abhimātiṣāha, in which,
though the vowel of the root is lengthened, the preceding final remains un-
changed.”
Whitney also notes: “This rule also belongs in the category of the
supererogatory, since in none of the words to which it relates does the pada-
text afford a different reading from that of the saṃhitā.” A more positive way
of interpreting this rule may be to say that it marks a stage of grammatical
analysis beyond the stage reached by the Padapāṭha, and hence, even though it
does not relate to the conversion of the padas into saṃhitā, it shows us the
progression of the grammatical science, cf. P.8.3.56 \(सहेः साडः सः\).

\(अ.वे. ११.४.२२\)।
Note: Whitney remarks that “the rule, moreover, is an unnecessary
one, since the pada-text everywhere offers the same reading with the saṃhitā,
as is expressly directed by a later rule.” Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p.
39\) suggests that combinations of aṣṭá with parṇá and dáṃṣṭra, which are not
attested in the Vulgate of the AV, may have existed in a genuinely Śaunakīya
recension of the AV. I tend to think that these are indications of the CA occa-
sionally straying into provisions for a general grammar of Sanskrit. However,
in this case, it should be noted that these examples are not found in the KV on
P.6.3.125 \(अष्टनः संज्ञायाम्\). The word aṣṭādaṃṣṭraḥ is found in Āśvalāyana-
Śrauta-Sūtra \(12.99.9\) and Āpastamba-Śrauta-Sūtra \(24.8.6\), but not in the
earlier Vedic texts. The fact that the rule of the CA includes daṃṣṭra, though it
is evidently a late usage, shows that the author of the CA was already leaning
toward a general grammar of Sanskrit.

Translation: Before the root vyadh, when it does not end in
any affix, \[the preceding vowel is lengthened\].

अध्याय ३, पाद १
376
Note: In the examples of this rule, the Padapāṭha is identical with the
Saṃhitāpāṭha reading, and hence we need to look at this rule as an advance of
grammatical analysis beyond the stage represented by the Padapāṭha.
The rule asserts that in a formation like śvā-vit < śvā-vidh < śvā-vyadh,
the root vyadh is apratyaya ‘does not end in an affix.’ However, it is clear that
here it is a verbal noun. The CA deals with a root-noun as a root without an
affix. This needs to be contrasted with Pāṇini’s procedure which adds an affix
such as KvIP, where ultimately each component of this affix is deleted, leaving
behind a Ø-affix. Pāṇini’s rule which provides lengthening in such cases
explicitly refers to the Ø-affix KvI, i.e. P.6.3.116 \(नहिवृतिवृषिव्यधिरुचिसहितनिषु
क्वौ\). Patañjali, however, uses the term apratyaya to refer to such zero-affixes
like KvIP, see: MB and Pradīpa on P.1.1.6 with reference to pipaṭhīḥ.
On the expression marmāvidham, AV \(11.10.26\), \[pseudo\]-Sāyaṇa’s
commentary offers a Pāṇinian derivation by adding the affix KvIP to the root
vyadh.

Note: Evidently, Whitney is listing some missing instances: “the
other cased afforded by the text are pary ū ṣu \(vi.6.4\), and para ū te \(xviii.3.7\).”
Of these two, the first one is actually found in the text of the CAB, and
Whitney just missed it. It is found in both the manuscripts, one of which, i.e.
H, was available to Whitney.
About the second example, i.e. para ū te \(xviii.3.7\), Whitney com-
ments: “Were it not for this last case, the rule of our treatise might have been
constructed like that of the Vāj. Pr., which says \(iii.109\) that u before su is
lengthened.” The gaṇa referred to in this CA rule is fully spelled out in APR
\(207a\) and the examples listed there occur exactly in the same order as in the
CAB. The example which is added by Whitney and which is not given by our
commentary here is the last example in the APR list. It is not clear why the
CAB did not list this example. It could be an example of omission, or it may
represent a change in usage. Compare this rule with Pāṇini 6.3.134 \(इकः सुञि\),
which has slightly wider coverage, but represents a generalization of the type
demanded by Whitney in his comments cited above.
३.१.५. ओषधेरपञ्चपद्याम् ।
Whitney \(3.5\).
Translation: \[The final i\] of the word oṣadhi \[is lengthened\]
before \[case endings\] other than the first five \[i.e. nominative
sg., du., pl., and accusative sg., and du.\].
Note: Whitney translates the condition apañcapadyām as ‘except in
the strong cases,’ and then assumes that this condition leaves everything else
open, including a situation where oṣadhi occurs as the first member of a com-
pound, and is followed by the second member. With such a wider
interpretation, he comments: “Since the rule does not restrict itself to forms of
declension, it is guilty of an oversight in taking no account of the compound
oṣadhija \(x.4.23 : p. oṣadhi-ja\) as a farther exception. In the only other
compounds which the text affords - viz. oṣadhīsaṃśita \(x.5.32 : p. oṣadhi-
saṃśita\), and oṣadhīmant \(xix.17.6; 18.6\) - the rule of the Prātiśākhya is
observed.”

अध्याय ३, पाद १
378
The closely similar rule in Pāṇini’s grammar, i.e. P.6.3.132 \(ओषधेश्च
विभक्तावप्रथमायाम्\), clearly seems to restrict this lengthening before a case ending,
other than the nominative, and it seems likely that the CA rule also applies be-
fore case endings alone, and not to the situations of compounds. If so, how
would one deal with the examples of compounds brought up by Whitney? The
APR may provide some assistance in this direction. The example oṣadhī-
saṃśita is included in a gaṇa of compound expressions showing similar
lengthening of the final vowel of the first member, cf. APR \(208, pp. 125-6\).
Though, it is true that there is no specific CA rule which would take care of
this lengthening. On the other hand, the text of the Padapāṭha, as given by the
VVRI edition reads: oṣadhī-saṃśitaḥ. This is different from the pada-reading
cited by Whitney. But, if this reading is somehow valid, then this may not
have been viewed as a case of lengthening at all, since the long vowel was al-
ready there in the Padapāṭha. The instance oṣadhīmant is clearly taken care of
by CA \(3.1.17: बहुलं मतौ\).

Note: Pāṇini 6.3.132 \(ओषधेश्च विभक्तावप्रथमायाम्\) prescribes lengthen-
ing of oṣadhi before all non-nominative case-endings, and hence जीवन्तीमोषधीम्
would be a normal formation in that system, while इमां खनाम्योषधिम् would be
an exceptional case. The situation is reverse with the CA formations.

entire commentary?
३.१.७. साढः ।
Whitney \(3.7\).
Translation: \[The vowel a in the root sah in the form\] sāḍha
\[is lengthened\].
Note: Whitney comments: “The rule is one of the most utterly super-
fluous presented by our treatise, which, of course, has nothing to do with the
mode of formation of such words. Moreover, if it was inclined to do a work
of supererogation as regards them, it should not have omitted to notice also
rūḍhvā, rūḍha, mūḍha, gūḍha, and other like forms which the text contains.
Probably the reason why this particular one was noticed, and not the others, is
that the regular form, according to the rules of the general grammar, is soḍha.”
Whitney’s last comment is the correct reason. Pāṇini too provides special
treatment only for this form, and not the other ones, which are derived by the
normal rules of his grammar. The normal rule, i.e. P.6.3.112 \(सहिवहोरोदवर्णस्य\),
changes the a of the root sah to o to derive the form soḍha. However, the next
rule, i.e. P.6.3.113 \(साढ्यै साढ्वा साढेति निगमे\), admits as nipātanas exceptional
forms like sāḍha for the Vedic language \(nigame\). For some reason, sāḍheti in
P.6.3.113, is analyzed by the Kāśikāvr̥tti as साढा इति, rather than as साढ इति,
and the commentary takes sāḍhā to be a nominative form of sāḍhr̥- : साढेति तृचि
रूपमेतत्. However, it does not cite any example for it. The SK on this rule of-
fers the example sāḷhā \(= sāḍhā\). But, interestingly, the commentary Subo-
dhinī says that the rule should also be applicable to the past participle sāḍha :
सूत्रे इतिशब्दः प्रकारार्थः । तेन निष्ठायामपि निपातनं बोध्यम् । ‘अषाळ्हो अग्ने वृषभः ।’ In
general, the Pāṇinian commentators show little familiarity with the AV
tradition.

३.१.८. बहुलं रात्रेः ।
Whitney \(3.8\).
Translation: \[The final i\] of rātri is diversely \[lengthened\].
Note: Whitney takes the author of the CA to the woodshed: “This is
rather a discreditable confession on the part of our treatise, whose business it is
to settle authoritatively the reading of its school in all cases admitting of any
doubt, that it does not feel equal to dealing with the irregularities of the word in
question. Nothing like it has hitherto met us, but we shall find several in-
stances in that which follows.” It is understandable that a similar appeal to di-
versity and irregularity of Vedic usage is found in Pāṇini 4.1.31 \(रात्रेश्चाजसौ\).
However, Pāṇini’s appeal is more acceptable, since he aimed at describing the
diversity of Sanskrit at large. On the other hand, we do indeed expect a more
exact accounting from a Prātiśākhya text. The use of bahulam in this and other
rules again indicates occasional leanings of the author of the CA in the
direction of a general grammar of Sanskrit. This is also apparent from
Whitney’s comment: “It is also a very unnecessary acknowledgment; for, in the
first place, there was no such rule as this absolutely called for, since the pada-
text everywhere reads all the forms of rātri like the saṃhitā.”
To look a little deeper into the wording of the rule, one may point out
that the genitive rātreḥ suggests that, for the author of the CA, as for Pāṇini -
cf. P.4.1.31 -, the basic stem form was rātri, and not rātrī, and the CA rule may
be taken literally to indicate the deemed deviant character of this word, a stem
in short i, occasionally providing forms in the text of the AV unpredictably
\(bahulam\) as if it were a stem in long ī. However, I agree with Whitney’s criti-
cism that we should expect from a Prātiśākhya a more exact account. For some
reason, the APR also does not take account of the diverse behavior of rātri.

tended by the commentator must have been rātrībhiḥ. This reading is also sup-
ported by the VVRI edition.
३.१.९. विश्वस्य नरवसुमित्रेषु ।
Whitney \(3.9\).
Translation: \[The final a\] of viśva is \[diversely lengthened\]
before nara, vasu, and mitra.
Note: Whitney points out that the examples brought together here are
heterogeneous. The word viśvānara is not broken up in the Padapāṭha into its
components. On the other hand, viśvāvasu of the Saṃhitā is represented as
viśva-vasu in the Padapāṭha. The word viśvāmitra is unchanged in the
Padapāṭha, while the word viśvamitrāḥ in AV \(18.3.63, 4.54\) is analyzed in the
Padapāṭha as viśva-mitrāḥ. Whitney also argues that it is difficult to justify the
continuity of the word bahulam into this rule from the previous rule. However,
his arguments against the continuity of bahulam are not strong. Compare
Pāṇini 6.3.128 \(विश्वस्य वसुराटोः\), 6.3.129 \(नरे संज्ञायाम्\), and 6.3.130 \(मित्रे चर्षौ\).
Pāṇini makes a semantic distinction between viśvānara vs viśvanara, and viśvā-
mitra vs viśvamitra. The lengthened forms are names, while non-lengthened
forms are descriptions. For example, on viśvamitrāḥ in AV \(18.3.63\), the
commentary of \[pseudo-\]Sāyaṇa renders it as सर्वजनमित्रभूताः, and not as mem-
bers of Viśvāmitra’s clan. Also see Whitney’s note on this verse \(AV Trans-
lation, Vol.II., p. 866\).

८.५.११; १९.३९.४\)।
Note: Whitney raises an objection to the continuation of the word ba-
hulam into the last two rules, and states that it certainly does not continue into
the next rule. However, how do we then account for the exceptional behavior
of the examples introduced by the commentator with the phrase: न च भवति?
We should also note that the exception is followed by all the editions of the AV
and is supported by the manuscripts. Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.II., p. 492\)
says, “Prāt. iii.10 \(= CA 3.1.10\) notes the double form śvápad and śvā́pad.” 
However, one must agree with Whitney that the rules do not have any
clear indications about the continuation and cessation of bahulam. It certainly
does not continue into the next rule. However, looking at the examples avail-
able in the AV text, the commentary is justified in continuing this word in these
two rules.
३.१.११. उपसर्गस्य नामिनो दस्ति ।
Whitney \(3.11\). A, B, D, J, M, P: omit स्य. A, B, D: °र्ग्र°. I: 11.
Translation: \[The final\] nāmin \[i.e. any vowel other than a
and ā\] of a pre-verb \[is lengthened\] before t of the root dā.
Note: Whitney notes that the two attested examples cited by the
commentator appear in an identical form in the Padapāṭha and the Saṃhitā-
pāṭha.

Note: The commentator quotes a number of forms not attested in the
AV. The forms apratīttam, parīttaḥ, prattam, avattam are listed under APR
\(217, p. 145\). Also see the examples cited in the KV under Pāṇini 6.3.124
\(दस्ति\), which include nīttam, vīttam, parīttam, prattam, and avattam.
३.१.१२. वर्तादिषु ।
Whitney \(3.12\). E, F, H, N, O, P: °र्त्ता°. A, B, C, D, Hb: वा°.
Translation: Before varta etc., \[the final vowel of the pre-
ceding item is lengthened\].

व॒र्तेन॑’ \(अ.वे. १.२९.१\)। ‘विश्व॑म॒न्याम॑भी॒वार॑’ \(अ.वे. १.
३२.४\)।
Note: Whitney, reading only from the manuscript H, believed that the
paraphrase of this rule had some missing words, which, if restored, would
read: उपसर्गस्य नाम्यन्तस्य वर्तादिषु परतः दीर्घो भवति. However, the second manu-
script, N, does not support this wording. The gaṇa referred to in this rule is
fully listed in APR \(207b\). It contains a listing of 21 instances. The CAB
quotes the first two instances from this list. It may have also contained the
cases listed under APR \(208\).
APR \(207b, p. 124\): उपसर्गस्योत्तरपदे दीर्घः, and the 21 cases listed under
this rule take care of the cases of the nāmin vowel of an upasarga being length-
ened before varta etc. However, Whitney lists a whole host of expressions
where the preceding is not an upasarga, nor does it necessarily end in a nāmin
vowel, and yet one finds lengthening. Many of these cases are found listed

अध्याय ३, पाद १
384
under the next rule of the APR, i.e. APR \(208, p. 125-6\). One may assume
that, contrary to Whitney’s expectation, the present CA rule had a general ap-
plication, not restricted to upasargas ending in a nāmin vowel, and that it may
have intended to encompass the examples covered by the two consecutive rules
of the APR, i.e. APR \(207b, and 208\).
I would just like to note in passing, that the lists of examples offered by
Whitney do not completely match the ones found under APR \(207b, and 208\),
and the discrepancies need to be individually investigated. They may possibly
indicate changes in the transmitted text of the AV.
३.१.१३. अकारस्याभ्यासस्य बहुलम् ।
Whitney \(3.13\).
Translation: The a of a reduplication is diversely \[length-
ened\].
Note: The word bahulam in the rule seems to be there to take care of
examples like sasahe cited by the commentator. It may be noted that the APR
\(209, p. 126\) reads अभ्यासस्य दीर्घश्छन्दसि. It is a somewhat strange formulation
in that one would expect a text like the APR to be concerned with the language
of chandas alone, and, therefore, one sees no purpose in the use of chandasi,
except to indicate that the forms where this kind of lengthening does not take
place are more like the non-chandas language. The gaṇa listed under this rule
cites examples of lengthening alone. The APR rule is also not restricted to the
vowel a of the reduplication. The rule contains no such restriction, and the
gaṇa contains the example jīhīḍa, the only case of non-a vowel. This example
is taken care of by the next rule of the CA.
Whitney draws our attention to the forms rūrupaḥ \(iv.7.5\), rīriṣaḥ
\(v.3.8\), and śūśucaḥ \(xviii.2.4\), and says: “The Prātiśākhya may intend to
include these forms in the gaṇa of rule 21 \(= CA 3.1.21\), below, but they
would much more properly have been provided for in the present rule.”
Indeed, the nārakādigaṇa referred to in CA \(3.1.21\), and as fully elaborated
under APR \(212, p. 129\) contains the first two examples cited by Whitney.
However, it is not clear why these examples were not covered by APR \(209\).

\(अ.वे. १.१६.३\)। ‘न स॑सहे॒ शत्रू॑न्’ \(अ.वे. २.५.३\)।
Note: Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p. 17\) points out that “the short a
in the reduplication of sasahe in c, though against the meter and in part against
usage, is read by all the mss., and in the comment to Prāt. iii.13 \(= CA
3.1.13\).” On AV \(2.5.3\), Whitney has further describes how certain texts, as
well as manuscripts of the AV, rectify the metrical deficiency by reading the
form as sasāhé \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p.44\). Whitney \(ibid., p. 28\) notes that
Sāyaṇa’s commentary on AV \(1.27.3\) reads dādr̥śuḥ. 
The first four examples, excluding the counter-examples, are cited un-
der APR \(209\).
३.१.१४. जीहीडाहम् ।
Whitney \(3.14\).
Translation: \[Also, in the form jīhīḍa in the phrase\] jīhīḍā-
ham, \[the vowel of the reduplication is lengthened\].
चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - जीहीडाहमिति च दीर्घो भवति ।
‘अ॒क्र॒तुर्ज॑ीहीडा॒हम्’ \(अ.वे. ४.३२.५\)। न च भवति ।
‘यद्वा॑ पि॒ताप॑राद्धो जिही॒डे’ \(अ.वे. ६.११६.२\)।
Note: Whitney rightly objects to the continuation of bahulam into this
rule as is clearly implied by the commentator. The counter-example given by
the commentary does not contain the word jīhīḍāham, but merely the word
jihīḍe. The form jīhīḍa is listed as a case of lengthening of the reduplication
under APR \(209, p. 127\). The APR rule says that this lengthening of the re-
duplication occurs chandasi. However, it does not make any effort to show
how such lengthening is avoided in the form jihīḍe, except by not listing it in
the gaṇa. In this case, the CA rule foregoes the generalization, and cites the
specific case where the lengthening takes place.
On the reading jīhīḍāham in AV \(4.32.5\), Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I.,
p. 204\) points out that the RV reading is jihīḍāham, “although the AV. saṃhitā
reading is unquestionably jīhīḍ-; the saṃhitā mss. have this almost without ex-

अध्याय ३, पाद १
386
ception \(all ours save O.\), the pada-mss. put after the word their sign which
shows a difference between pada and saṃhitā reading, and jīh- is twice dis-
tinctly prescribed by the Prāt. \(iii.14 = CA 3.1.14; iv.87 = CA 4.3.15\).”
३.१.१५. साह्याम ।
Whitney \(3.15\). C, Hc, Nc: स°.
Translation: \[Also, in the form\] sāhyāma \[the vowel of the
root sah is lengthened\].
Note: Quite clearly, this is not a case of the lengthening of a redupli-
cation, and hence needed to be dealt with separately. The APR \(212, p. 129\)
lists this form in the nārakādigaṇa referred to also in CA \(3.1.21\). Obviously,
the membership of these gaṇas as conceived by these texts was different.
Under the present rule, Whitney cites a number of “causative forms from ver-
bal roots which show in the first or radical syllable a short a in pada and a long
ā in saṃhitā, and which are not specially noted in this section, being left, appar-
ently, to fall into the gaṇa of rule 21 \(= CA 3.1.21\), below. ... They are
yāvaya etc. \(e.g. i.20.3\), from yu; cyāvayati etc. \(e.g. x.1.13\), from cyu;
vānayantu \(vi.9.3\), from van; yāmaya \(vi.137.3\), from yam; and glāpayanta
\(ix.9. 10\), from glā.” Most of these forms, except the forms of yam, are listed
in the nārakādigaṇa of the APR \(212, pp. 129-130\), which is also referred to
by CA \(3.1.21\).

‘सा॒ह्याम॒ दास॒मार्य॑म्’ \(अ.वे. ४.३२.१\)।
३.१.१६. विद्मादीनां शरादिषु ।
Whitney \(3.16\). C: विघ्नादीनां°.
Translation: \[The final vowels\] of vidma etc. \[are length-
ened\] before śara etc.
चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - विद्मादीनां शरादिषु परतः बहुलं दीर्घो

रोगं॑ चास्रा॒वम्’ \(अ.वे. १.२.४\)। ‘ए॒वा मे॑ प्राण॒ मा बि॑भेः’
\(अ.वे. २.१५.१\)।
Note: The APR does not have a single gaṇa which encompasses all
of these examples. The examples of the lengthening of eva are listed under
APR \(216c, p. 134\). But this list does not include verbs like vidmā. Verbs
with similar lengthening are listed under APR \(215c, 215d, p. 132\), but these
lists do not include the form vidmā.
Whitney has given the full statistics of both of these Gaṇas as they are
found in the text of the AV. Unlike the Gaṇapāṭha in the Pāṇinian school, we
have no complete listings of Gaṇas mentioned in the CA. Also, it is clear that
there is no reason to continue the word bahulam into this rule. Had the word
bahulam continued into this rule, there would be no need to mention it ex-
pressly in the following rule: बहुलं मतौ.
३.१.१७. बहुलं मतौ ।
Whitney \(3.17\). Hb, Nb: बहुमतविछायां.
Translation: Before the \[affix\] mat, \[the preceding vowel is\]
diversely \[lengthened\].
Note: Whitney notes that mat in this rule also covers vat. It is the
same affix for Pāṇini with the change of m to v, cf. P.8.2.9. The examples in
the commentary here cover only the latter. The same coverage is found in APR
\(210, pp. 127-8\). The only example of mat is tviṣīmat. Its instances are
included in the APR list, and the same example is cited by Whitney.
The APR \(210\) offers a long list of instances, out of which the CAB
quotes the first three instances. Here, a major difference emerges between the
treatment of the same topic by these two texts. Since the CA frames its rules in
a generic way, it uses the term bahulam, and then the commentator is forced to
offer instances where the lengthening does not take place. On the other hand,
the APR expects to provide full listings where the particular change takes
place, and hence it often does not feel the need to cite the exceptions.

Note: By referring to the corresponding RV \(vii.96.4a, b\) forms janī-
yántaḥ and putrīyántaḥ, Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.II., p. 767\) remarks: “That
our denominatives \[in AV\] have a right to their short i is further vouched for
by their quotation as examples for it under Prāt. iii.18 \(= CA 3.1.18\).” The
examples cited by the CAB are found in the same order on APR \(154: यकारादौ
बहुलं दीर्घः\), including the exceptions. Even the word प्रभृतीनि च is found in the
APR \(p. 108\). Also see the examples on APR \(211, pp. 128-129\). This close
correspondence shows that the CAB and the APR belong to the same basic
tradition.
३.१.१९. तृतीयान्तस्य ।
Whitney \(3.19\).
Translation: The final \[vowel\] of an instrumental form \[is
diversely lengthened\].

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका389
Note: Whitney notes: “In the form of this rule there is nothing which
continues the implication of bahulam, but such an implication is, of course, un-
avoidably necessary, and is made by the commentator.” Whitney has provided
statistics for tenā and yenā, cf. Whitney \(1862: p. 132\). Additionally, he points
to forms sahasyenā, bhadreṇā, amr̥tenā, kāvyenā, and martyenā each of which
occurs only once. I have not located any treatment of these lengthened forms
in the APR.

Note: The example punā raktaṃ vāsaḥ cited by the CAB is not found
in the Vulgate of the AV, and Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 40\)
suggests that this may have occurred in the genuine Śaunakīya recension of the
AV, and that the Vulgate is not the genuine Śaunakīya recension. This
example is cited in the KV on P.8.3.14 \(ro ri\).
Whitney’s reading of the last few sentences of the commentary was:
kim artham idam nodārddhate : purūcī rāyaḥ : yady api ralopo dīrgha evaivaḥ.

३.१.२१. नारकादीनां प्रथमस्य ।
Whitney \(3.21\).
Translation: For words like nāraka \[or words listed in the
nārakādi-gaṇa?\] the first \[vowel is lengthened\].

Note: The gaṇa referred to in this rule is fully listed in the APR \(212:
प्रथमस्य दीर्घः\). It contains a total of 28 instances, out of which the CAB quotes
the first three instances in exactly the same order. However, for many words
listed in the nārakādigaṇa in the APR, the CA has separate rules, and hence the
membership of this list as intended by the CA and the APR could not have
been identical, cf. Notes on CA \(3.1.13, and 3.1.15\).
Surya Kanta \(APR, p. 75\) points out: “Whitney cites sūyamān \(AV 4.
27.1\) on nārakādīnām prathamasya III.21, which is not found in the printed
AV. text and is contradicted by our treatise.” Surya Kanta is referring to the
reading as suyamān. Whitney, however, does note the variation of the mss.
readings, cf. AV Transl. Vol.I., p. 196, and is not as absolute in his opinion as
implied by Surya Kanta.
३.१.२२. दीदायादीनां द्वितीयस्य ।

Note: The gaṇa referred to in this rule is fully listed in APR \(213:

first three instances in exactly the same order. Whitney says: “The only other
word of like character which I have noted in the Atharvan is śrathāya \(vii.83.3:
p. śrathaya\).” The gaṇa as listed in the APR contains śrathāya.
३.१.२३. सात्रासाहादीनामुत्तरपदाद्यस्य ।
Whitney \(3.23\). O: °दीनांमुत्त°.
Translation: For \[compound expressions like\] sātrāsāha, the
first vowel of the second member \[is lengthened\].

\(अ.वे. १.२०.४\)। ‘वि॒षा॒स॒हिः’ \(अ.वे. १.२९.६\)।
Note: The gaṇa referred to in this rule is fully listed in APR \(214\).
Out of a total of seven instances listed, the CAB quotes the first three in exactly
the same order. Whitney adds abhimātiṣāhaḥ \(AV 4.32.4\), nyāyanam \(AV
6.77.2\), and ukthaśāsaḥ \(AV 18.3.21\). On the last one, he says: “which the
pada-texts of the Rik and White Yajus write uktha-śasaḥ, ... is read in our pada
\(xviii.3.21\) uktha-śāsaḥ.” Of these three examples, the first and the last are
listed in the sātrāsāhādigaṇa under APR \(214, p. 131\). Also, the Padapāṭha for
ukthaśāsaḥ is given as uktha-śasaḥ in the VVRI edition, and by Surya Kanta
\(APR, p. 131\). The VVRI edition notes uktha-śāsaḥ as a variant pada-reading.
However, the inclusion of this instance in the sātrāsāhādigaṇa in the APR
makes the pada-reading uktha-śāsaḥ less likely. The APR list also includes
yama-sādana \(AV 12.5.64\), which is not cited by Whitney.

CAB, all the other examples are found under APR \(216b\).

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका393
Whitney, who could read the cited verse only imperfectly from his
manuscript, renders it as: “adha is long before a consonant, excepting the cases
in which it is followed by tyam and dhīḥ; but before a consonant preceded by a
vowel \(?\) it is everywhere only short.” The same verse in APR \(216b, Notes,
p. 63\) is rendered by Surya Kanta as: “The final of adha is lengthened before a
consonant, except tyam and dhīḥ. It is invariably adha \(with a short a\) before
the initial vowel of the following word; but before a consonant it is long.” The
way this meaning is extracted from the verse is by slightly emending verse.
Surya Kanta says: “Emend MS, atha into adha and put an avagraha mark be-
tween -ne and hra- \(= ne ’hra\).”
Whitney points to “yet another case in the text in which the final vowel
is left short, and which has been overlooked both by treatise and commentator:
it is adha syāma \(xviii.3.17\).” Surya Kanta \(APR, Notes, p. 63\) says that even
though the manuscripts report this reading without variants, it “may be,
accordingly, corrected into adhā.” The VVRI edition reads adha syāma, but
notes that the manuscripts P and P2 for the Padapāṭha give the reading adhā
syāma. The absence of this example in the listing of examples as well as
counter-examples provided under APR \(216b, pp. 133-4\) needs a careful
answer. One way to sort this out is to assume that the APR list of positive
examples is illustrative and not exhaustive. Then, since the present case is not
covered by the exceptions, we assume that the APR knew this instance as adhā
syāma. A similar argument must be made for the example adhā yathā naḥ \(AV
18.3.21\), which is offered by the CAB, but is not found in the list given under
APR \(216b\).

Note: Whitney’s remarks on this rule are most virulent: “The subject
of the duplicated pronunciation of consonants, or of the varṇakrama, ... is one
of the most peculiar in the whole phonetical science of the Hindus. It is also
the one, to my apprehension, which exhibits most strikingly their characteristic
tendency to arbitrary and artificial theorizing; I have not succeeded in discov-
ering the foundation of fact upon which their superstructure of rules is based,
or explaining to myself what actual phonetic phenomena, liable to occur in a
natural, or even a strained, mode of utterance, they supposed themselves to
have noted, and endeavored thus to reduce to systematic form.” On the other
hand, as Whitney himself notes: “The varṇakrama, however, forms a not in-
conspicuous part of the phonetic system of all the Prātiśākhyas, and is even
presented by Pāṇini \(viii.4.46-52\), although the latter mercifully allows us our
option as to whether we will or will not observe its rules.” However, one
should note that Pāṇini’s rules cited by Whitney do not relate to the doubling of
consonants in the word-final position.
Referring to this rule, Lanman \(AV Transl. Vol.II., p. 832\) comments:
“Considering the exaggerated nicety of the theory of the Hindus respecting
consonant groups \(cf. Whitney, AV Prāt., p. 584-90\), and in particular their
doctrine of the varṇakrama \(‘at the end of a word, a consonant is pronounced
double,’ padānte vyañjanaṃ dviḥ, Prāt. iii. 26 = CA 3.2.1\), it is strange that the
mss. sometimes fail to come up even to the simple requirements of orthography
as set by grammar and sense. On the other hand, it can hardly be said that the
mss. in the cases of these shortcomings are a less truthful representation of the

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका395
actual connected utterance of the text than would be for instance the graphical
representation of the English some more by the words some ore.” It is of
course correctly assumed by Lanman that the reciters and the copyists have no
inkling of the meaning of the expressions being recited or copied, and hence
such multiple mechanical reproductions are all the more likely.
Neither the manuscripts of the AV, nor those of the CA, show this
doubling of the final consonants. This also goes against the general tendency
of the language reflected in Pāṇini 8.2.23 \(संयोगान्तस्य लोपः\). Perhaps this doc-
trine represents a deliberate effort to counter the weakening of the final conso-
nants as evidenced by Prakrits. This may also be an ancient interpretation of
the final unreleased unexploded consonant, cf. RPR \(6.39-42\). To make the
non-release clear, one needs to lengthen the silence. I owe this suggestion to
Professor A.M. Ghatage, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune. 
As I have pointed out above, Pāṇini does not support the doubling of
word-final consonants. However, a Vārttika cited in the KV on P.8.4.47 \(अन-
चि च\) reads: अवसाने च यरो द्वे भवत इति वक्तव्यम्: “It should be stipulated that,
before a pause, a consonant other than h is doubled.” The examples cited are:
वाक्क्, वाक्, त्वक्क्, त्वक्, षट्ट्, षट्, तत्त्, तत्. These examples look very much
like the ones cited by the CAB on the present rule. This Vārttika appears as
अवसाने च in the MB on P.8.4.47, and, on this Vārttika, Patañjali rejects the
necessity of making such a separate statement, but derives the same doctrine by
reinterpreting P.8.4.47: तत्तर्हि वक्तव्यम् । न वक्तव्यम् । नायं प्रसज्यप्रतिषेधः - अचि
नेति । किं तर्हि? पर्युदासोऽयम् - यदन्यदच इति. Patañjali says that the condition
अनचि च does not mean: “the doubling does not occur, when followed by ac = a
vowel,” but it means: “the doubling occurs, when followed by something other
than a vowel.” This last phrase “something other than a vowel” is interpreted
broadly to include consonants, as well as pause \(avasāna\). Kaiyaṭa disputes
the correctness of this reading of the MB: पाठोऽयं लेखकप्रमादान्नष्टः - पर्युदासे
ह्यच्सदृशस्य वर्णान्तरस्य निमित्तत्वेनोपादानादवसाने द्विर्वचनस्याप्रसङ्गात् । तस्मात् - नायं पर्यु-
दासो यदन्यदच इति । किं तर्हि? प्रसज्यप्रतिषेधोऽचि न - इत्ययं पाठः । तत्र प्रसज्यप्रतिषेधे
विधिरनुमीयते । अच उत्तरस्य यरो नूनं द्विर्वचनं सर्वत्रास्ति यतोऽचि प्रतिषिध्यते. However,
he finally concludes: एवं चानैमित्तिकं द्विर्वचनमवसानेऽपि भवति : “Thus, the uncondi-
tional doubling of a \[final\] consonant occurs even before a pause.” With all the
confusion concerning the exact reading of the MB, this seems to be the inten-
tion of Patañjali. I have a strong feeling that Pāṇini does not sanction such a
doctrine, but it is sanctioned by Patañjali. The agreement of Patañjali’s doctrine
with that of the present CA rule may perhaps indicate the eastern origin of the
CA. It is possible that the diglossic gap between Sanskrit and Prakrit being

अध्याय ३, पाद २
396
much wider in the east than in the west, some ‘protective’ modes of pronuncia-
tion of final consonants developed specifically in the east.
The other question which is left unclear by the present CA rule is
whether the doubling of the word-final consonant takes place unconditionally,
i.e. irrespective of what follows, or does it take place specifically before pause.
The rule does not contain the word अवसाने, comparable to the Vārttika dis-
cussed above.
Whitney thinks as follows: “If the first rule of the second chapter \(=
CA 2.1.1: saṃhitāyām\) is to be strictly applied, we must conclude that the
makers of the Prātiśākhya recognized the duplicated methods of pronunciation
as of force only in the saṃhitāpāṭha, and not in the utterance of the disjoined
text, or the padapāṭha. This interpretation is somewhat supported by the fact
that both the Rik Pr. \(vi.3, r. 14, cccxc\) and Pāṇini \(viii.4.51\) attribute to Śākala
or Śākalya, the teacher to whom the invention of the padapāṭha is generally
ascribed, a denial of all duplicated utterance.”
This argument does not seem to be cogent. The next rule of the CA
says: “The final ṅ, ṇ, and n, preceded by a short vowel, are doubled before a
vowel.” Such a rule would not make sense if the previous rule were to pre-
scribe unconditional doubling of a final vowel, irrespective of what followed.
The best resolution of the confusion is to conclude that rule CA \(3.2.2\) applies
under the condition of sandhi between two words, while the previous rule ap-
plies before an avasāna ‘pause.’ Thus, the rule may apply to words, before
pause, in the Padapāṭha, as well as in the Saṃhitāpāṭha. One can agree with
Whitney that the present rule “is directly in contravention with the doctrine of
the other treatises \(R. Pr. vi.2, r. 7, ccclxxxiv; V.Pr. iv. 114; T. Pr. xiv. 15\),
which unanimously teach that a consonant is not duplicated in pausa.” How-
ever, that need not deter us from accepting that the CA has a distinctive doc-
trine of its own. The similarity of the CA view with the view given in the
Vārttika \(अवसाने च\) on P.8.4.47 has been pointed out above.

short vowel, \[are doubled\] before an \[initial\] vowel \[of the next
word\].

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका397
Note: For the implication of this rule that the previous rule applies to
final consonants before a pause, see the Note on CA 3.2.1.
Whitney says: “Pāṇini and the Taitt. Pr. very properly treat this dou-
bling of a final nasal as something apart from and unconnected with the phe-
nomena of the varṇakrama, by teaching it in a different part of their texts from
that which deals with the latter subject; and in the Rik Pr., also, the rule rather
follows next after, than is introduced among, those which prescribe the other
duplications.” This rule is distinct from other consonant doublings in being
obligatory both in Vedic and the classical language, and Pāṇini explicitly calls
this doubling nityam ‘obligatory,’ cf. P.8.3.32 \(ङमो ह्रस्वादचि ङमुण्नित्यम्\). Pro-
cedurely, we may point out that Pāṇini teaches front-end augments to the word-
initial vowels, rather than doubling of the word-final consonant. However, this
is simply for system-internal reasons, which do not tolerate consonant clusters
at the end of a pada, cf. P.8.2.23 \(संयोगान्तस्य लोपः\).

Note: The form r̥ṇoti is found in Nighaṇṭu \(2.14\), but it is not attested
in any known Vedic text. The example सुगण्णास्ते is an artificial example. No
instance of word-final ṇ is found in the AV text. The rule thus represents a
phonetic generalization applicable to the general grammar of Sanskrit. This
tendency is manifest here in the CA rule, in the CAB, as well as in the cited
versified authority. The Pāṇinian commentators were also forced to offer the
same kind of artificial examples, because in the natural usage of Sanskrit, we
do not find word-final ṇ. See the KV on P.8.3.32 \(ङमो ह्रस्वादचि ङमुण्नित्यम्\). It
is difficult to see the real need of including the treatment of word-final ṇ in this
rule.

३.२.३. संयोगादि स्वरात् ।
Whitney \(3.28\).

‘त्रसति’

‘आद्रवति’ ‘प्रद्रवति’ ।
अपर आह । स\(N: सं\)यमं । पूर्वस्येति ।
Note: The doubling prescribed by this rule is not exhibited by the
manuscripts of either the AV or the CA. There is a similar passage in the CAB
on CA \(1.2.16\): संयोगादि पूर्वस्य स्वरस्य भवति । अत्र सति \(?\)। आद्रवति \(the only
AV form, आद्रवत्, अ.वे.पै.सं. २.३१.२\)। प्रद्रवति \(no attested AV forms for प्र\+द्रु\)।
अपर आह - हसयमं पूर्वस्येति \(?\)। Considering the context, the last segment of
this passage probably reconstructs to: अपर आह - सयमं पूर्वस्येति । This could be
interpreted to mean that a consonant, along with its yama, goes with the previ-
ous vowel, in the context of syllabication. This could apply to an example like
aggniḥ, especially if we interpret the sequence gg as a sequence of g followed
by its yama, i.e. ग्ँ. Thus, while the initial consonant of a consonant cluster
goes with the previous vowel, a consonant followed by its yama may go with
the previous vowel, along with that yama. The rest of the passage probably
reconstructs to: आत्तरसति । त्रसति । आद्द्रवति । प्रद्द्रवति. Here, three out of the
four examples would show doubling of the initial consonant of a cluster after a
vowel, while the example trasati shows the absence of such doubling, since the
consonant cluster does not follow a vowel.
The verb ā-\!tras is not attested in Vedic literature, but trasantu is found
in AV \(5.21.8\).
The lone manuscript H, which Whitney used, has a number of missing
rules. Now, with the second manuscript of the commentary, N, and the rest of
the manuscripts of the CA, we are able to confidently fill the lacuna which dis-
tressed Whitney a great deal.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका399
३.२.४. छकारश्च ।
Whitney, H: no such rule. E, F, I, N, O: श्च, while other mss: स्य.
Translation: The consonant ch \[is doubled after a vowel\].
Note: In an example like puccha cited by the commentary, one must
assume pucha to be the original form. With the doubling taught by the present
rule, we get puchcha, which is finally reduced to puccha with the deaspiration
of the first ch taught by CA \(1.4.3: सोष्मणि पूर्वस्यानूष्मा\). 
Pāṇini achieves this same final outcome by prescribing an end-augment
t \(= tUK\) to the vowel preceding ch. This t is then changed to c by other rules.
While the CA rule has a wide obligatory coverage, Pāṇini’s rules note variation
regarding this phenomenon, cf. P.6.1.73-76\). One should especially note that
Pāṇini makes this procedure optional \(or preferred a la Kiparsky\), when a
word-final long vowel is followed by word-initial ch, cf. P.6.1.76 \(पदान्ताद्वा\).
Also see the Notes on CA 2.1.17 for a further discussion on ch.

Note: Whitney’s edition did not have either this rule or the commen-
tary. However, in his “Collation of the Second Manuscript of the Atharvaveda
Prātiśākhya” \(1880, p. 161\), Whitney says: “The second rule declares that ‘in
pippali etc. there is duplication after the first vowel of the word.’ The cases
here contemplated, judging from the word taken as example, are of a wholly
different character from the others to which the rules of duplication relate,
being such as have a double letter as part of their original and proper orthogra-
phy. I do not, therefore, think it at all worth to look through the Atharvan text
in order to pick out the other words which may have been included in the
gaṇa.” One of the assumptions in the rule seems to be that the double conso-
nant cannot be etymologically derived, but must be a surface level phonological
rule. This suggests some interesting ideas about the possible intended ety-
mologies for these words. Such intended etymological connections can be
guessed for some words, e.g. pittam < \!pā and cittam < \!ci. The examples
pippalī and pippalam seem to suggest that the author of the CA held the forms
pipalī and pipalam to be more basic, cf. pīpal in Hindi. The forms majjā and
majju were probably derived from maj\+ā and maj\+u respectively, and the
consonants were doubled later on. The form majjuḥ, though unattested, may
be possibly related to the form majjūka cited in the Nirukta \(9.5\), which is,
according to the Roth-Böhtlingk dictionary, related to the word maṇḍūka. The
most mysterious form is miccham. Even if one takes this as an error for
piccham, this form would be covered by the previous rule, and there is no need
to offer it here. A number of mss. of the AV offer the reading piṣpalī for
pippalī. It is not clear whether pippalī is a Prakritization of piṣpalī, or whether
piṣpalī is a hyper-correction for pippalī. See: Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., pp.
359-360\).
As for cittam, one may perhaps also refer to the occurrence of this
word in AV \(18.4.14\). Referring to the mss. variants, Whitney \(AV Transl.
Vol.II., p. 876\) points out: “The mss. vary in a between citám and cittám; our
text reads the latter; SPP’s the former, which is doubtless correct, and which is
implied by the translation.” It is an undeniable possibility that the CAB knew
the reading cittám, and yet it felt that the word must be derived by doubling the
consonant of an original citám, which alone fits the context, as correctly
guessed by Whitney. Also see the same problem in AV \(18.4.37\), cf. AV
Transl. Vol.II., p. 881.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका401
A perusal of the APR helps clear a good deal of confusion regarding
the citations given under this rule. Rules APR \(106-111a, pp. 76-77\) deal with
words containing the geminates yy \(106\), jj \(107\), ll \(108\), pp \(109\), tt \(110\),
and nn \(111a\). APR \(107\) deals with the words majjā \(AV 4.12.3\) and rajjuḥ
\(AV 4.3.2\). APR \(109\) deals with pippalī \(AV 6.109.1\), pippalaṃ \(AV
9.9.20\), and pippalyaḥ \(AV 6.109.2\). APR \(110\) deals with pittam \(AV 1.24.
1; 18.3.5\) and vittam \(AV 18.4.89\). In all likelihood, the present CA rule
refers to the same collection of instances. The main difference between the CA
and the APR seems to be that while the CA speaks of doubling, suggesting
some prior stage of derivation without such doubling, the APR simply
represents an enumeration of instances with specific geminated consonants. It
may also be noted that the manuscript Vn for the APR records the reading
cittam, where other manuscripts read vittam. 
The pippalyādi gaṇa and the doubling of consonants in the words listed
in this gaṇa is referred to in a verse cited in the CAB on CA \(1.1.12\).

there was no doubling of consonants involved in triple clusters. There seems to

Other treatises offer similar rules, but there are differences. For details,
see: Whitney \(1862: 142\), and Deshpande \(1975: 208\).
Whitney further observes: “The instances are wanting in variety, as il-

must suppose our rule to apply no less to groups of two, and to forbid duplica-
tion in such words as antaḥ, asti, aṣṭa, etc.”

The text of the commentary on CA \(3.2.8\) shows that Whitney’s emen-
dations of the text of the commentary on CA \(1.2.18\) were mostly correct.
Neither the manuscripts of the CA, nor those of the AV, show this doubling.
The CAB does not explicitly continue the condition svarāt from CA
\(3.2.3\), but that word must continue into this rule. This is clear from
Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary on CA \(1.2.18\), and the near equivalence of
this rule with P.8.4.46 \(अचो रहाभ्यां द्वे\), cf. Notes on CA \(1.2.18\).
We say that this rule is a near equivalent of P.8.4.46, rather than identi-
cal with it, because the two rules predict slightly different results in a few
cases. Consider for instance a form like arhati. Here, in the cluster rh, the CA
rule would require doubling of h, since it applies to all consonants coming after
r or h. This would give us the form arhhati. Pāṇini’s rule 8.4.46, on the other
hand, prescribes the doubling of yaR consonants. The abbreviation yaR refers
to all consonants, except h, and, therefore, P.8.4.46, will not lead to the dou-
bling of h in arhati. The doubling of h was not universally accepted by
Sanskrit phoneticians, cf. Varma \(1929: 114-115\).

AV, and that the Vulgate is not the genuine Śaunakīya recension. Here,
Whitney cites the example from the commentary as वर्ष्ष्योदकेन and not as वार्ष्यो-
दकेन, as reported by Surya Kanta. Secondly, Whitney does not report the ac-
tual reading in the mss. H: वष्योदकेन. Thirdly, the second manuscript of the
commentary offers the reading: बाष्पोदकेन. None of the mss. provide the dou-
bling of ṣ as required by the rule. Surya Kanta is claiming the possible
Śaunakīya status for a ghost reading. However, the word वर्ष्याः is found in AV
19.2.1 referring to rain-water, and this makes the original reading वर्ष्योदकेन a
likely reading.
On this rule, Whitney points out that “the manuscripts of the AV., so
far as known to me, do not, save in very infrequent and entirely sporadic cases,
follow any of the rules of the varṇakrama proper, excepting the one which di-
rects duplication after a r ; and even in this case, their practice is as irregular as
that of the manuscripts of the later literature.”
This rule is similar to P.8.4.49 \(शरोऽचि\). Compare the examples cited
by the KV on this rule: कर्षति, वर्षति, आकर्षः, अक्षदर्शः । अचीति किम् । दर्श्श्यते ।.
The first several examples of the CAB seem to have been taken over from the
KV, and the copyists have probably garbled them up.
३.२.१०. प्रगृह्याश्च प्रकृत्या ।
Whitney \(3.33\). I, O: °ह्यश्च°. A, B, D: प्रगृह्यश्चेमाकृत्य. I: 10. O:
°प्रकृत्याः.
Translation: The pragr̥hya \[vowels, as defined in CA \(1.3.
11-19\)\] remain unaltered.
Note: Regarding an anomalous case, Whitney observes: “The text
offers a single case in which a final pragr̥hya vowel is combined with a fol-
lowing initial: it is nr̥patī ’va \(viii.4.6\). The same passage is found in the Rig-
Veda \(vii.104.6\), exhibiting the same anomalous sandhi. ... That no reference

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका405
is made to the passage in our treatise is possibly to be taken as an indication
that the true Atharvan reading is nr̥patī iva, as is actually given by E. and I.”
The VVRI edition reads nr̥patī iva, and the Padapāṭha clearly supports this
reading as a pragr̥hya: nr̥patī iveti nr̥patī ’iva. The VVRI edition also notes that
a large number of manuscripts read nr̥patīva. The complicating factor with iva
is that the tradition treats nr̥patī iva as a compound form. This instance is listed
as nr̥patīva under APR \(105, p. 76\), though a late manuscript Vn records the
reading nr̥patī iva. A few deviant instances such as maṇīva < maṇī\+iva were
known to Pāṇinian commentators, and an apocryphal Vārttika : मणीवादीनां
प्रतिषेधो वक्तव्यः came up to deal with such exceptional cases. For a discussion of
this statement, see: Kaiyaṭa’s Pradīpa on the MB on P.1.1.11. In any case, I
tend to agree with Whitney’s guess that the original Atharvan reading was
most probably nr̥patī iva, but, I suspect that under the influence of the RV tra-
dition, it was unconsciously altered by the reciters to nr̥patīva.

Note: The CAB cites all the same examples in the same order as are
found under APR \(103\). Whitney, however, points out additional cases which
are not covered by the citations in the commentary, e.g. Whitney \(AV Transl.

अध्याय ३, पाद २
406
Vol.I., 459\) refers to sádanā akarma in AV \(7.97.4\) as a case of hiatus, and
says: “the irregular hiatus must be regarded as falling under Prāt. iii.34 \(= CA
3.2.11\), although the passage is not quoted by the commentary to that rule.” 
The example sadanā akarma \(AV 7.97.4\) raises further complicated
questions. It is cited under APR \(100, p. 71\) as an example of an ekādeśa
combination, where there may be doubt as to the original long vowels. All the
examples cited under this rule show that a vowel combination has taken place,
except the example sadanā akarma. My guess is that this example too must
have been read as sadanākarma \(< sadanā \+ akarma\) by the person who in-
cluded it in the APR list of ekādeśas, though it is clear that the meter requires it
to be read as sadanā akarma. In any case, it is clear that it does not come under
the present rule, or under APR \(103\).
३.२.१२. यवलोपे ।
Whitney \(3.35\). 
Translation: When the \[final\] y and v are dropped \[by CA
\(2.1.21\), the preceding vowel does not combine with the fol-
lowing vowel\].
चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - यकारवकारलोपे च प्रकृत्या भवति ।

५\)। ‘ता इ॒मा आपः॑’ \(अ.वे. १५.१५.७\)।
Note: The examples cited here by the CAB are identical with the ones
cited under CA \(2.1.21\).
Whitney, in his comments on the present rule, point to several anoma-
lous cases. For example, AV \(9.4.19\) reads ब्राह्मणेभ्य ऋषभं दत्त्वा, while the
meter requires the sandhi: ब्राह्मणेभ्यर्षभं दत्त्वा. On the other hand, on AV
\(10.1.15\), Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.II., p. 564\) says: “All the saṃhitā-mss.
\#or rather, most of them: see also note to Prāt. iii.35 \(= CA 3.2.12\)∃ combine
kr̥tyé’ti \#and thus indeed the meter requires us to pronounce∃; but our edition
restores the more correct reading \#kr̥tya íti∃, since the Prāt. does not counte-
nance the irregularity; we should expect to find it with vandane’va \(in ii.56 =
CA 2.2.17\).” The VVRI editions sticks to the manuscripts and keeps the

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका407
reading kr̥tyeti. However, we must note that the exceptional behavior of kr̥tyeti
is noticed neither by the CA, nor by the APR, and it makes one wonder
whether the reading as known to these texts was the expected regular form
kr̥tya iti < kr̥tye iti.
३.२.१३. केवल उकारः स्वरपूर्वः ।
Whitney \(3.36\). Hb, Nb: °उका स्वर°. O: °स्वरः पूर्वः.
Translation: An u, when a word by itself, preceded by a
vowel, \[is not combined with the following vowel\].
Note: For example, in स उ एव, AV \(13.4.5\), the combination of
saḥ\+u results in sa u, by the previous rule. The present rule makes the u in
such combinations immune from combinations with the following vowels.

३.२.१४. नमौ सन्ध्यौ ।
Whitney \(3.37\). J.K: न समौ सन्ध्यौ. Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s commentary in K at-
tempts to justify this reading.
Translation: The sounds n and m, resulting from euphonic
combinations, \[remain unchanged\].
चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - नकारमकारौ च सन्ध्यौ प्रकृत्या
भवतः\(H, N: ति\)। ‘नदीन्तरति\(H, N: नंदी°\)’ । ‘त्रिष्टुम्न-
\(H, N: न्न\)यति’ ।
Note: The second example is found in the KV on P.8.4.45 \(यरोऽनु-
नासिकेऽनुनासिको वा\).
Besides pointing out that the examples offered by the commentator are
fabricated examples, Whitney informs: “The former is intended to show that a
n which is the result of the assimilation of a final m, by ii. 31 \(= CA 2.1.31\),
before an initial t, is not liable to a farther insertion of a sibilant before that t, by

अध्याय ३, पाद २
408
ii. 26 \(= CA 2.1.26\); the latter, that a m which grows out of the assimilation of
a final labial to a following initial dental, by ii. 5 \(= CA 2.1.5\), is not then, by
ii. 31 \(= CA 2.1.31\), convertible into n by a second assimilation.”
Whitney also makes an important observation: “This rule ... is replaced,
or rendered unnecessary, in the other treatises, by the general precepts there
referred to.” For example, in the Pāṇinian system P.8.4.45 \(यरोऽनुनासिकेऽनु-
नासिको वा\) converts a final labial stop to m before a nasal. A final m is con-
verted to an anusvāra by P.8.3.23 \(मोऽनुस्वारः\), and then the anusvāra is con-
verted to a homorganic nasal before a non-spirant consonant by P.8.4.58
\(अनुस्वारस्य ययि परसवर्णः\). Now, the rule P.8.2.1 \(पूर्वत्रासिद्धम्\) institutes a con-
vention by which, in the following sections of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, a given rule
does not recognize the outputs of the following rules, but recognizes the out-
puts of the preceding rules. Thus, in the example triṣṭumnayati < triṣṭup\+
nayati, P.8.3.23 \(मोऽनुस्वारः\) does not recognize the change of p > m brought
about by P.8.4.45 \(यरोऽनुनासिकेऽनुनासिको वा\), and hence it does not convert this
m into an anusvāra. In the absence of an anusvāra, P.8.4.58 \(अनुस्वारस्य ययि
परसवर्णः\) does not operate with respect to our example. This is how the form
\*triṣṭunnayati is prevented in the Pāṇinian system.
३.२.१५. आकारः केवलः प्रथमं पूर्वेण ।
Whitney \(3.38\). A, B: °प्रथमः°. P adds a daṇḍa after केवलः.
Translation: The sound ā, \[forming a separate word\] by it-
self, is first \[combined\] with the preceding vowel, \[and then
with the following vowel\].
Note: Different systems of grammar followed different strategies.
For example, Pāṇini assumes that the combination of ā with the following form
takes place first, e.g. dhiyā\+ā\+ihi > dhiyā\+ehi. However, after this has been
done, the combination of dhiyā\+ehi must exceptionally provide dhiyehi, rather
than the normal expected result dhiyaihi. To achieve this exceptional result, he
composed a special rule: P.6.1.95 \(ओमाङोश्च\). The KV notes that this is an
exception to the normal vr̥ddhi rule, P.6.1.88 \(वृद्धिरेचि\): वृद्धिरेचीत्यस्यापवादः. The
present CA rule, like RPR 2.7: आनुपूर्व्येण सन्धीन्, achieves the same result with a
different procedure. First we combine dhiyā\+ā > dhiyā, and then we combine
dhiyā\+ihi to derive the expected dhiyehi. This is achieved by stipulating the
order of combinations. One may infer from this that the normal order of these
combinations, without the present exception-rule, might have been the other
way around. Whitney seems to draw a reverse conclusion: “The latter is the

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका409
true method of making the two successive sandhis, as we are taught by this
rule, and by corresponding rules in the other treatises; which, however, express
themselves in a more general manner, declaring that all sandhis must be made
in the order of their occurrence.” The reason why the linear order of sandhis
may not have been looked at as the necessary order is that a relationship
between a preverb and a verb is viewed as a more ‘interior’ relationship, in
comparison with the relationship of the preverb with a non-verb item. In most
of the examples cited by the commentator, the ā is followed by a verb form.

∀ ‘अव॑ । प॒श्य॒त॒ । आ । इ॒त॒,’ अ.वे. १८.४.३७\)।
Note: All the examples cited by the CAB are cited in the same order
under APR \(8\), which also cites the present CA rule. One may also note that
the APR sorts its examples into two categories, those where the ā is followed
by i, and those where the ā is followed by e. The first is dealt with by APR \(8\),
while the second is dealt with by APR \(9\). In the cases listed under APR \(9\),
the order of sandhis does not seem to really make any difference, e.g. ihaitu <
iha\+ā\+etu, AV \(1.15.2\).
On dhiyéhi \(AV 2.5.4\), Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p. 44\) says: “The
first half-verse is vs. 5 in AŚS., where it reads: ... dhiyā hiyānaḥ. Of the two
versions of the last pāda, that of AŚS. is doubtless the original, though ours
\(the pada has dhiyā́ ā́ ihi ā́ naḥ\) is ingenious enough to give a fair sense; the
reading dhiyéhi is authenticated by the Prāt. comment, which quotes it more
than once \(to iii.38 = CA 3.2.15; iv. 113-115 = CA 4.4.14-16\).”
Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.II., p. 564\) points to another example which
is subject to this rule, though the pada-text does not clearly indicate it in this
fashion: “The pada-mss. have in b upa-eyimá, and the combination to upeyimá
falls under the rule Prāt. iii.38, although the ā contained in eyimá \(= ā-īyimá\)
does not appear as ā in the pada-text.” Since, in this case, the finite verb is ac-

अध्याय ३, पाद २
410
cented, the unaccented upasargas are compounded with the verb by CA \(4.1.
23: उपसर्ग आख्यातेनोदात्तेन समस्यते\), and with two upasargas involved in this
compound, only the first juncture is separated with an avagraha in the pada-
text.
३.२.१६. स्वरे नामिनोऽन्तस्थाः ।
Whitney \(3.39\): °न्तःस्थाः. No manuscript supports Whitney. A, B:
°मिनांतस्थाः. 
Translation: Before a vowel, the nāmins, i.e. vowels other
than a and ā, are changed to \[appropriate\] semi-vowels.
Note: The rule as stated is indeed too broad, and its domain is
brought down to its proper size by the subsequent exception rules which fol-
low. Finally, its actual scope is limited to the vowels i, u, r̥, \(and theoretically l̥\)
changing respectively to y, v, r, \(and l\), before dissimilar vowels. The choice
of appropriate substitutes is governed by CA \(1.4.4: आन्तर्येण वृत्तिः\). The CAB
on CA \(1.4.4\) specifically refers to the present rule as a case for the application
of CA \(1.4.4\) which says that the choice of a substitute is determined in terms
of maximal featural proximity to the original sound. Also: Hueckstedt \(1995\).
चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - स्वरे परतः नामिनः अन्तस्था भवन्ति।
‘दध्यत्र’ । ‘मध्वत्र’ । ‘मात्रर्थम्’ । ‘पित्र\(H, N: तृ\)र्थम्’ ।
Note: As Whitney rightly observes, these examples are fabricated ex-
amples and are identical with those found in the commentaries on Pāṇini’s rule
6.1.77 \(इको यणचि\). This fact may perhaps allow us to set the upper limit for
the date of this commentary, if we can date the first appearance of these exam-
ples in Pāṇinian commentaries. At the very least, it is quite clear that the com-
mentator is substantially under the influence of the Pāṇinian tradition, though,
unlike the other two commentaries, he does not directly cite Pāṇini’s rule.
Interestingly, Surya Kanta selectively omits these examples from his claim that
such unattested examples belong to the so-called genuine Śaunakīya recension.
३.२.१७. सन्ध्यक्षराणामयवायावः ।
Whitney \(3.40\). M, Na: °यवः.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका411
Translation: The diphthongs \[i.e. e, o, ai, and au, before
vowels, are respectively, replaced by\] ay, av, āy, and āv. 
चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - सन्ध्यक्षराणां स्वरे परतः अयवायावो

\(H, N: य\)कः’ । ‘पव\(H:, N: च\)नम्’ । ‘पाव\(H, N: च\)-
कः’ ।
Note: The first several examples, which are examples of external
sandhis, do not show the y or v of ay, av, āy, and āv, but show the stage of
their deletion by CA \(2.1.21-22\), and the remaining vowels are immune from
combination with the following vowels by CA \(3.2.12\).
The examples cayanam, lavanam, cāyakaḥ, lāvakaḥ and pāvakaḥ are
stock examples in the Pāṇinian tradition right from Patañjali’s MB. Also see
the KV on P.6.1.78 \(एचोऽयवायावः\). Again, as Whitney notes, the commentator
prefers to give stock examples from the Pāṇinian tradition, rather than real ex-
amples from the text of the AV. However, Whitney correctly notes that these
last “are examples of applications of the rule which the Prātiśākhya does not
contemplate.” These last examples illustrate the present rule in the situation of
internal sandhi. 
३.२.१८. पूर्वपरयोरेकः ।
Whitney \(3.41\).
Translation: The preceding and the following \[vowels are
combined into\] a single \[substitute, in the following operations\].
Note: Whitney comments: “The technical language of the Prāti-
śākhyas has no recognized method of indicating the fusion of two sounds into
one, and the form of the following rules is ambiguous, since rule 44 \(= CA
3.2.21\), for instance, literally means, according to the phraseology of the trea-
tise, that a before i becomes e, and not a with i. Hence the necessity of this
special rule of interpretation.” One may add that Pāṇini is not different from

अध्याय ३, पाद २
412
the Prātiśākhyas in this respect, cf. P.6.1.84 \(एकः पूर्वपरयोः\) and the following
rules. Also curious is the inversion of the word-order in the statement of the
rule, as compared to Pāṇini 6.1.84.
चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - पूर्वपरयोरेको भवति । एतदधिकृतं
वेदितव्यम् । इत उत्तरं यदनुक्रमिष्यामः ।
३.२.१९. समानाक्षरस्य सवर्णे दीर्घः ।
Whitney \(3.42\). Hc, Nc: सामान्याक्षरस्य°.
Translation: A simple vowel, followed by a member of the
same varṇa group, becomes long.
Note: The wording of this rule is very similar to Pāṇini’s rule 6.1.101
\(अकः सवर्णे दीर्घः\). However, the main difference lies in the fact that while
Pāṇini 1.1.9 \(तुल्यास्यप्रयत्नं सवर्णम्\) explicitly defines the term savarṇa as referring
to a sound sharing the same point of articulation and the manner as the sound
in question, the CA does not define the term savarṇa. In the CA, this term oc-
curs only once. The CAB on CA \(1.1.27\) quotes an ancient Śikṣā verse which
defines the term savarṇa as: समानास्यप्रयत्ना ये ते सवर्णा इति स्मृताः, which closely
parallels P.1.1.9. However, a closer study of the CA shows that the CA seems
to be using the term in a more basic meaning, i.e. member of the same varṇa,
e.g. i and ī are members of the same varṇa, and are hence represented by the
term ivarṇa. For an extensive study of the different notions of savarṇa, see:
Deshpande \(1975: 91-93\).

Note: Notice that Surya Kanta has conveniently made no claim for
the cited examples as belonging to his so-called genuine Śaunakīya recension.
The KV on P.6.1.101 \(अकः सवर्णे दीर्घः\) cites the examples daṇḍāgram, dadhīn-
draḥ, madhūdake, and hotr̥̄śyaḥ. The Osmania edition of the KV notes a
manuscript variant madhūṣṭram for madhūdake. This variant is probably a cor-
ruption of madhūṣṇam. Also noteworthy is the absence of an example of -l̥\+l̥-.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका413
This is natural for the CA since one does not have any words ending in l̥, and
this fact has been explicitly stated in CA \(1.1.6: अन्ऌकारः स्वरः पद्यः\). 
३.२.२०. सीमन्ते ह्रस्वः ।
Whitney \(3.43\). Hb, Nb: सीमंतर्हस्वः. Most mss. read र्ह for ह्र.
Translation: In sīmanta \[< sīma\+anta, the combination re-
sulting from a\+a\] is a short \[a\].
चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - सीमन्ते ह्रस्वो भवति । ‘जि॒न॒तो व॑ज्र॒
त्वं सी॒मन्त॑म्’ \(अ.वे. ६.१३४.३\)। सीमन्ते केशवेष्टेति
वक्तव्यम् । यो हि सीम्नो अन्तः सीमान्तः सः ।
Note: Whitney argues that the theme here is sīmant and not sīmanta.
He however acknowledges that the rule seems to presuppose a derivation as
sīmanta coming from sīma\+anta. Whitney notes that the Padapāṭha does not
analyze this word into its components. The APR \(p. 137\) lists sīmanta in the
samudrādi gaṇa, a list of words which are not analyzed because of unclear
components and unclear combinations.
However, as in other cases, the CA rule marks an effort to move the
grammatical analysis of words beyond the stage of the Padapāṭha. The CA and
the CAB are indeed not alone in deriving sīmanta from sīma\(n\)\+anta. On
P.6.1.94 \(एङि पररूपम्\), Kātyāyana offers a Vārttika: शकन्ध्वादिषु च. This list
begins with the word śakandhu < śaka\+andhu, where the combination of a\+a
results in a, rather than ā. One of the additional examples on this Vārttika of-
fered by Patañjali is sīmanta, which he explicitly analyzes as sīma\+antaḥ. Then
Patañjali says: केशेष्विति वक्तव्यम् । यो हि सीम्नोऽन्तः, सीमान्तः स भवति. The pas-
sage in the CAB reminds one of the MB passage. I wonder whether the read-
ing केशवेष्टेति is a garbled form for the original केशेष्विति .
३.२.२१. अवर्णस्येवर्ण एकारः ।
Whitney \(3.44\). J, M \(corr\), P: °स्येववर्ण°.
Translation: A member of the a-varṇa \[i.e. a, ā etc.\] followed
by a member of the i-varṇa \[i.e. i, ī etc.\] is replaced with e.

चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - अवर्णस्य इवर्णे परतः एकारो भवति।
‘खट्वेन्द्रः’ । ‘मालेन्द्रः’ ।
Note: The manuscript H reads: ravadgomālendraḥ, and by comparing
this with examples under Pāṇini \(vi.1.87\), Whitney restored this to khaṭven-
draḥ, mālendraḥ. These examples are also found in the KV on P.6.1.84 \(एकः
पूर्वपरयोः\), and in the MB on P.6.1.87 \(आद्गुणः\). This restoration is now clearly
supported by the second manuscript, N. 
३.२.२२. उवर्ण ओकारः ।
Whitney \(3.45\). A, B, D, Hb: °उकारः for °ओकारः.
Translation: \[A member of the a-varṇa, i.e. a, ā etc.\] fol-
lowed by a member of the u-varṇa \[i.e. u, ū etc.\] is replaced
with o.
चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - अवर्णस्य उवर्णे परतः ओ\(H: ॐ\)-
कारो भवति। ‘खट्वोदकम्’ । ‘मालोदकम्’ ।
Note: The example khaṭvodakam is found in the KV on P.6.1.87 \(ād
guṇaḥ\). Both of these examples are found in the MB on P.6.1.87.
Commenting on an anomalous form, Whitney says: “There is a single
instance in the text, in which this rule is not observed, and a\+ū ar not combined
into o, but into au : it is the word prauḍhaḥ \(xv.15.4 : p. pra-ūḍhaḥ\). B., in-
deed, reads proḍho, but doubtless only by an error of the copyist. We must
suppose, either that the authors and commentator overlooked this word, or that
its pada as well as saṃhitā reading in their text would be prauḍhaḥ, or that the
passage containing it was not in their Atharva-Veda - of which suppositions, I
should regard the first as the most plausible, and the last as the least likely.”
The VVRI edition finds one more manuscript, O, which shares the reading
proḍho, but the edition chooses the majority reading prauḍhaḥ. 
Pāṇini is probably familiar with the form proḍha, as it appears in the
gaṇa mentioned in P.2.1.17 \(तिष्ठद्गुप्रभृतीनि च\). \[Of course one cannot be totally
certain if all the words in such lists go back to Pāṇini.\] The formation
prauḍhaḥ is not provided for by Pāṇini, but is provided for by Kātyāyana’s
Vārttika : प्रादूहोढोढ्येषैष्येषु on P.6.1.89 \(एत्येधत्यूठ्सु\). It is also interesting to find
that Kaiyaṭa on this Vārttika still attempts to derive the expression प्रोढा

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका415
प्र\+आ\+ऊढा प्रोढाशब्दे आ\+ऊढा ओढा, प्र\+ओढा इति स्थिते ‘ओमाङोश्च’ इति पररूपं
भवति, MB, \(MLBD edn, Vol. II., p. 745\). It is thus possible that the oldest
reading was indeed proḍha, which was gradually supplanted by prauḍha, and
under the pressure of the post-Kātyāyana Pāṇinian tradition, the Atharvan re-
citers almost completely replaced an older proḍha with a later form prauḍha.
Such a speculation is further supported by the fact that the APR also makes no
effort to account for an anomalous prauḍha.
३.२.२३. अरमृवर्णे ।
Whitney \(3.46\).
Translation: \[A member of the a-varṇa, i.e. a, ā etc.\] fol-
lowed by a member of the r̥-varṇa \[i.e. r̥, r̥̄ etc.\] is replaced with
ar.

‘तस्य॑र्ष॒भस्याङ्गा॑नि’ \(अ.वे. ९.४.११\)। ‘अव॑र्तिः’ \(अ.वे.

मा\)र्तः’ \(not in AV\)। ‘नैना॒नव॑र्तिः’ \(अ.वे. ४.३४.३\)।
Note: Whitney’s AV text for 9.4.11 reads: तस्य॑ ऋष॒भस्याङ्गा॑नि ।
Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.II., p. 530\) points out: “All our mss. \(save O.\) read,
like the edition, tásya r̥ṣa- in c, although the passage is quoted as example
under the Prāt. rule \(iii.46 = CA 3.2.23\) that a and ā\+r̥ make ar.” The same
reading is maintained by SPP and VVRI editions. One wonders whether this
is a case of the influence of the Pāṇinian grammar on the text-tradition of the
AV, cf. P.6.1.128 \(r̥ty akaḥ\). It is also clear from the context that the instance
must be kāmartaḥ < kāma\+r̥taḥ, and not kāmārtaḥ < kāma\+ārtaḥ as cited by the
manuscripts. There is some disagreement concerning the interpretation of the
word ávartiḥ in AV \(4.34.3\). Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p. 206\) says: “The
pada-text writes ávartiḥ without division, yet the comment to Prāt. iii.46 \(= CA
3.2.23\) quotes the word as exemplifying the combination of final a and initial r̥;
the comm. understands and explains it as a-vartti\!” 
On this rule, Whitney has extensive comments on the practice of the
manuscripts of the AV, and the phonetic implications of that practice: “They
follow a method of their own, in which is to be recognized the influence of a
doctrine agreeing with or resembling that of our Prātiśākhya respecting the

अध्याय ३, पाद २
416
svarabhakti, or figment of vowel sound, assumed to be thrust in between r and
a following consonant \(see i.101, 102 = CA 1.4.10-11\). Where the phonetical
theory requires the insertion of the longer svarabhakti, or where a sibilant fol-
lows, there the manuscripts usually and regularly give the vowel r̥ instead of r,
reading iva r̥ṣabhaḥ \(iii.6.4\), svasa r̥ṣīṇām \(vi.133.4\), etc.; before any other
consonant, or where our treatise and the Rik. Pr. interpose the shorter svara-
bhakti after the r, and the other Prātiśākhyas require no insertion at all, there
our manuscripts regularly make the combination according to the rule now
under discussion, writing r̥tasya rtena \(vi.114.1\), iva rbhuḥ \(x.1.8\), sa rcām
\(x.8.10\), etc. These rules are not, however, altogether without exceptions.”
३.२.२४. उपर्षन्त्यादिषु च ।
Whitney \(3.47\). Ha, Na: omit च. J, M: उपरिषन्त्या°. P: उपरिषांत्या°.
Translation: \[The final a of an upasarga combines with the
initial r̥ of the verb to yield ar\] also in forms like uparṣanti.
Note: This rule is an exception to the next rule, i.e. CA \(3.2.25\)
which predicts the result ār in a combination of a final a of an upasarga and the
initial r̥ of a verb.

र्षन्ति॑’ \(अ.वे. ९.८.१६\)।
Note: Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 43\) points out that the
APR \(13\), examples 34-36, indicate a reading upariṣánti, rather than uparṣánti
as expected by CA \(3.2.24\). He concludes from this that the Vulgate, which
follows the APR, is not a Śaunakīya text, and that a genuine Śaunakīya text
had the reading as expected by the CA. As I have shown above, the mss. J
and M read upariṣantyādiṣu, and would lead one to believe that the same tradi-
tion which copied and maintained knowledge of the CA was perhaps conver-
sant with the different reading, and that reading shows up even though it con-
tradicts the very rule of the CA. Such a situation would indicate a change
within a tradition, rather that the existence of two entirely separate and unre-
lated traditions. The variation in the mss. of the AV noted by both Whitney

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका417
and Surya Kanta may also indicate the same situation, i.e. that some manu-
scripts represent a more conservative reading, while others represent a latter-
day changed pronunciation. Both Whitney \(on CA 3.2.24 = W: 3.47\) and the
VVRI editions note the existence of the manuscript variation of the readings:
uparṣanti, upa r̥ṣanti, and upariṣanti.
३.२.२५. उपसर्गस्य धात्वादावारम् ।
Whitney \(3.48\). A, B, D, J, P: उपसर्गधात्वादाचारं.
Translation: \[The final a or ā\] of an upasarga is replaced
with ār, before verb-initial \[r̥ or r̥̄\].
Note: Strictly speaking, the rule refers to avarṇa at the end of an
upasarga and r̥varṇa at the beginning of the verb-form. The word avarṇasya
continues from CA \(3.2.21\) and r̥varṇe from CA \(3.2.23\). Thus, in theory, the
rule refers to classes of a-vowels and r̥-vowels, irrespective of the length of the
instances. However, the CAB speaks of r̥kārādau, restricting the rule to verb-
initial short r̥. This is done probably for two reasons. In practice, we do not
have verb-initial r̥̄. Secondly, Pāṇini’s rule 6.1.91 \(उपसर्गादृति धातौ\) which
deals with the same phenomenon also refers to short r̥.
चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - उपसर्गस्य अवर्णान्तस्य ऋकारादौ
परतः धातौ आरं भवति । ‘उपार्षति’ । ‘प्रार्षति’ । ‘उपा-

Note: The examples upārcchati, prārcchati, and upārdhnoti are found
in the KV on P.6.1.91 \(उपसर्गादृति धातौ\).
None of the instances cited by the commentator are attested in the AV.
Whitney says: “The only case arising under the rule in the Atharva-Veda is
ārcchatu, at ii.12.5. Our treatise might, then, like the Vāj. Pr. \(iv. 57\), have re-
stricted the operation of the rule to the preposition ā. The Taitt. Pr. \(x.9\) states
the principle in the same general form in which it is given here.” This is clearly
an instance of the CA moving closer to the format of a generic grammar of
Sanskrit.
३.२.२६. भूतकरणस्य च ।
Whitney \(3.49\).

अध्याय ३, पाद २
418
Translation: Also, the \[a\] of the past-tense marker, \[before
the verb-initial r̥, is replaced with ār\].
Note: Whitney remarks: “This rule, of course, in a treatise whose
subject is the sandhyapadyau guṇau of words \(i.1 = CA 1.1.2\), is out of place
and superfluous.” The rule, like many others of this kind, represents an inter-
est on the part of Prātiśākhya authors to occasionally move in the direction of a
generic grammar of Sanskrit, cf. P.6.1.90 \(आटश्च\).

Note: The examples khaṭvaiḍakā and khaṭvaitikāyanaḥ are found in
the KV on P.6.1.88 \(वृद्धिरेचि\). The fact that the text of the commentary has
khaṭvairagā instead of khaṭvaiḍakā, may mean that either the author of the
CAB, oearly copyist, was from a western regions like Rajasthan. For
the interchange of ḍ and r, and k and g, in Rajasthani dialects of medieval
times, see: Ernest Bender \(1992: 90-91\). Such a possibility is strengthened by

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका419
the fact that most of the manuscripts of the CA are found in Rajasthan and
Gujarat. Also see the Note on CA 2.1.12 for another similar case.
३.२.२८. ओकारौकारयोरौकारः ।
Whitney \(3.51\). A, D: ओकारो°. O: ओकारौकायोरौकारः.

३.२.२९. शकल्येष्यादिषु पररूपम् ।
Whitney \(3.52\). A, B: वाकल्ये°. M, N: °शादिषु°. K: शाकल्येष्वादिषु°. 
Translation: In sequences such as śakalyeṣi, \[the final vowel
of the preceding word combined with the initial of the follow-
ing\] is replaced with the following \[initial\] sound.

∀ ‘उ॒प॒ऽएष॑न्तम्,’ अ.वे. ८.६.१७\)।
Note: Whitney remarks: “Of these cases \(cited by the CAB\), the first
would equally admit of being regarded as a case of regular sandhi, and ana-
lyzed as śakali-eṣi : the second is analogous with the combinations to which
rule 38 of this chapter \(= CA 3.2.15\) relates, the preposition ā being in saṃhitā
combined with upa, and then the resulting upā with itana. Of this kind, the text

अध्याय ३, पाद २
420
presents one additional instance, in upeyima \(x.1.10: p. upa-eyima; it is made
up of upa-ā-īyima\) : it is the only passage falling under the rule which the
commentator does not give.”
Whitney’s comments given above may be tempered down in view of
the fact that the CAB cites all the same examples which are listed under APR
\(62\) and the CA rule is identical in wording with APR \(62\). This shows that
the traditional understandings of these form were quite different from what
Whitney proposed for them.
Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p. 25\) points out: “The pada-reading
śakalya-eṣi in b is assured by Prāt. iii.52, but the meaning is extremely obscure.
Ppp. has the better reading śākalyeṣu ‘among the shavings’; janitram rather re-
quires a locative. The comm. guesses it as loc. of śakalyeṣ, from śakalya ex-
plained as a ‘heap of shavings,’ and root iṣ ‘seek,’ and so an epithet of fire;
BR. conjecture ‘following the shaving, i.e. glimmering.’”
३.२.३०. एकारौकारान्तात्पूर्वः पदादेरकारस्य ।
Whitney \(3.53\). E, F, Hb, I, Nb, O: °पूर्वपदादे°.
Translation: After final e and o, the word-initial a \[ becomes

२\)। ‘यो॑ऽस्य॒ दक्षि॑णः॒ कर्णः॑’ \(अ.वे. १५.१८.३\)। ‘सो॑ऽर-
ज्यत’ \(अ.वे. १५.८.१\)।
Note: The reading te ’kravan of H led Whitney to suggest an emen-
dation to te ’kr̥ṇvan, which “also is not to be found in the Atharvan.” The
manuscript N offers a better reading: te ’bruvan.
The example te ’vadan is cited in the KV on P.6.1.115 \(प्रकृत्यान्तःपाद-
मव्यपरे\). However, this instance is also traceable to RV \(10.109.1\), and hence
we cannot be sure if the KV is citing this passage from the AV. This rule is in
part comparable to APR \(99\). We should note that all the examples in the
CAB are found in the same order as examples 68-71 on APR \(100\).
While admitting that this is an “exceedingly common sandhi,” Whitney
observes: “The physical explanation of this combination is exceedingly diffi-

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका421
cult.” Perhaps, one may suggest that as one moves from e or o to the conso-
nant after the word initial a, one inevitably goes from a more open sound to a
point of a relative oral constriction. If a is itself a close \(saṃvr̥ta\) sound, then it
is just like a point in the normal transition from an open sound to a constriction.
For other detailed explanations, see: Allen \(1962: pp. 39ff\) and Cardona
\(1987\).
३.२.३१. क्वचित्प्रकृत्या ।

Translation: Sometimes, \[the word-initial a\] remains un-
changed.

\(अ.वे. ३.२१.१\)। ‘स॒ह॒स्रा॒र्घ\(H, N: र्च\)मि॒डो\(H, N: डे\)
अत्र॑’ \(अ.वे. १८.१.४३\)।
Note: One may note that these exceptions are not specifically taken
care of by the APR, except that the APR \(100\) refers to a nebulous rule: बहुलं
छन्दसि. The present CA rule is comparable to P.6.1.115 \(प्रकृत्यान्तःपादमव्यपरे\)
and the following rules.
Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 40\) suggests that the example
सहस्रर्चमिडे अत्र which is not attested in the Vulgate of the AV, possibly belongs
to the now lost genuine Śaunakīya recension of the AV. Whitney cites the ex-
ample as सहास्रर्चम्, while both the manuscripts offer the reading सहस्रार्चम्. 
The reading सहस्रार्चमिडे अत्र is obviously a corruption for स॒ह॒स्रा॒र्घमि॒डो अत्र॑
\(AV 18.1.43\). This shows the fallacy of Surya Kanta’s hypothesis.

Translations: The authorities \[lit. makers of definitions\]
recognize only six types of circumflex \(svarita\) accent. Of
these, \[in the order in which they are explained\], each preceding
one is harder \[than the succeeding one, and\] the succeeding one
is softer \[than the preceding one\]. 
Note: Whitney \(p. 154\) cites the five verses beginning with this verse
as belonging to the commentary in the mss H. However, these verses are
found in all the mss. which provide only the text of the CA. Since the CAB
does not comment on these verses, it is possible that at one time they belonged
to that commentary itself, but were incorporated later into the text of the CA.
Whitney \(1880: 162\) says: “The passage introductory to the third section of
this chapter and which, in the edition, I treated as a part of the commentary, is
found in B., as if belonging to the text. That it belongs to the text, however, as
an original and proper part of it, is by no means to be believed; it is, rather
\(along with the two similar passages to be noted later\), the interpolation of
some reworker. This is evidenced both by its own character and by the fact
that the comment takes no notice of it; it did not belong to the treatise which the
commentator took in hand to explain.” There is also a strong possibility, as
suggested by Whitney, that these passages may be interpolations of a later
period. However, since these verses are found in all manuscripts, including
those that call themselves Kautsa-Vyākaraṇa, this incorporation must have
taken place at a reasonably early time. Therefore, I have decided to treat these
verses as part of the text of the CA as it can be reconstructed on the basis of
our manuscripts. A, B, D: षडेच. E, F, I, O: लक्षणानि प्रति°. Surya Kanta \(APR,
Intro., p. 61\) makes a far looser claim for incorporation of all sorts of portions
of the commentary into what he styles the older CA: “A deeper analysis of
CCA \(= CAB\) should suggest that the portion now styled as comment, is, in
reality, nothing but relics of the older CA., that the metrical portions betokened
by Whitney as citations from some ancient authority are mutilated parts of the

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका423
older CA., and that longer metrical portions thrown into Additional Notes by
the editor are definitely so. They are so, all the more, because in all the mss. of
the CA., they are read as part of the Sūtra-text; they must, accordingly, be rein-
stated to their proper position.” Not all the verses cited in the CAB are treated
by the other manuscripts as belonging to the Sūtra-text, and one must make a
careful distinction between these two classes of verses. The fact that certain
verses are treated by most manuscripts as being part of the Sūtra-text does not
by itself prove that they must be part of the original CA. They could very well
be ancient interpolations into the Sūtra-text from the commentary. It is also
true that the later text-tradition did treat them as being part of the Sūtra-text. 
As Whitney points out: “Precisely what is meant by ‘sharp’ \(tīkṣṇa\)
and ‘hard’ \(dr̥ḍha\) on the one hand, and ‘soft’ \(mr̥du\) on the other, is not very
clear: but that the proper circumflex, which arises upon the combination into a
single syllable of an original acute and an original grave element, is more
strongly marked and distinct in its quality of double pitch than that circumflex
which is only enclitic, need not be doubted.”
Some light is shed on this question by the possibility that different
kinds of svaritas represent different levels of musical pitch. S. Varma \(1929:
156\), referring to Pāriśikṣā, informs us that the types jātya, abhinihita, and
kṣaipra are pronounced with niṣāda, or the 7th note on the Indian musical scale.
The types tairovyañjana and pādavr̥tta are pronounced with dhaivata, or the 6th
note. The types praśliṣṭa and pratihata are pronounced with pañcama, or the
5th note. On the whole, one may conclude that higher musical pitch is referred
to by the terms ‘sharp’ or ‘hard,’ and the lower musical pitch is referred to by
the term ‘soft.’ This distinction is still common in the Indian classical music till
today, where the term tīvra ‘sharp’ refers to higher pitch, and the term komala
‘delicate, soft’ refers to lower pitch. The order of the types of svarita given by
the present CA verse does not completely match the one given by the Pāriśikṣā,
but one does notice some shared features, and this indeed seems to be the
intended difference between the various types of svarita. Unfortunately, the
reciters of the ŚAV I met in India were not able to demonstrate these
differences in their recitation, and it would seem that these distinctions have
been lost in the recitation of the AV.

Translation: Abhinihita, Prāśliṣṭa, and both Jātya and Kṣipra,
as well as Tairovyañjana and Pādavr̥tta, - this is the group of
svarita \[varieties\].
Note: The order of the different types of svaritas given in this verse,
and assumed in all the first four verses of this section is directly correlated to
the order in which these types are defined in the rules that follow, i.e. abhini-
hita \(3.3.6\), praśliṣṭa \(3.3.7\), jātya \(3.3.8\), kṣaipra \(3.3.9-12\), tairovyañjana
\(3.3.13\), and pādavr̥tta \(3.3.14\). This matching shows that the verses are inte-
grally related to the rules that follow. The verses present the notions of relative
hardness and softness of these types, but do not define their exact nature, while
the later rules define the exact circumstances of each type, without going into
the question of their relative hardness. However, both the sections assume the
same order of presentation of these types, and hence are clearly complementary
to each other.
३.३.३.सर्वतीक्ष्णोऽभिनिहितस्ततः प्राश्लिष्ट उच्यते ।

Translation: The abhinihita is the sharpest of all. \[Softer\]
than that is said to be the prāśliṣṭa. Softer than that is the next
pair of accents, i.e. jātya and kṣipra.
Note: The verse is found in the Māṇḍūkīśikṣā \(verse 82\), Śikṣā-

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका425
Translation: Softer than those is said to be the accent called
tairovyañjana. The pādavr̥tta is softer \[than that\]. Such are the
relative strengths and weaknesses of the svarita varieties. 
Note: This verse is also found in the Māṇḍūkīśikṣā \(verse 83\), Śikṣā-

३.३.५. अपर आह - तैरोव्यञ्जनपादवृत्तौ तुल्यवृत्ती इति । उदात्तः

J, M, O: °पूर्वपरो° for °पूर्वः । परो°. O, P: °स्वरितसंधिः.
Translation: Another \[phonetician\] says: “Tairovyañjana and
Pādavr̥tta are of similar utterance.” \[In a svarita\], the first \[por-
tion\] is high-pitched \(udātta\). The following \[portion\] is low-
pitched \(anudātta\). A svarita is a combination of these two.
Note: The tag phrase apara āha clearly indicates that this was in all
probability originally not part of the text of the CA, but that of a commentary.
However, the entire passage is found in all the CA-text-only manuscripts. One
may also note the curious fact that the text of the Varṇapaṭala, a Pariśiṣṭa of the
AV, contains verses introduced with the phrase अपर आह, and the verses along
with the tag phrase are cited in the CAB. See the commentary and the Note on
CA \(1.1.28: रेफस्य दन्तमूलानि\).
Whitney had assigned the entire preceding portion to the commentary.
However, regarding उदात्तः पूर्वः, परोऽनुदात्तः, स्वरितः सन्धिः he said: “I am not al-
together confident that this is not the first rule of the section, since, as we shall
see, the two rules which follow are defective in form, and need some such
predecessor. Considering, however, the faulty construction of the whole sec-
tion, the limited applicability of the words in question as an adhikāra or heading
for that which follows, their inconsistency with rule 66 \(= CA 3.3.17\) below,
and the absence of the paraphrase and repetition which ought to follow them, if
they are a rule, I have not ventured to regard them as a part of the treatise; they
are more probably an addition of the commentator, intended to supply the de-
ficiency of the next two rules.” As I pointed out in my Note on CA \(3.3.1\),
Whitney was not willing to accept this initial portion as part of the text of the
CA even after the discovery of a second manuscript of the CA which contained
this portion. Now it is clear that each and every manuscript of the CA contains

अध्याय ३, पाद ३
426
this initial portion, and we have to accept it as part of the text of the CA. How-
ever, it could have been a very early addition, which remained somewhat unas-
similated even up to the composition of the CAB.
३.३.६. एकारौकारौ पदान्तौ परतोऽकारं सोऽभिनिहितः ।
Whitney \(3.55\). Ha, Na: एकारौ पदांतौ°. A, B: ऐकारौ°. E, F, I, O:
°परतोऽकारः°. 
Translation: \[Where\] the final e or o \[are merged with\] the
following a \[resulting into e and o respectively\], that \[svarita\] is
\[called\] abhinihita.
Note: The commentary adds significant information which is not ex-
plicit in the rule itself. The commentator specifies that it is a combination of the
final high-pitched e or o with the following low-pitched a. This general infor-
mation is derived from the immediately preceding rule, CA \(3.3.5\). This rule is
an exception to CA \(3.3.17: एकादेश उदात्तेनोदात्तः\), which prescribes that a
combination of a high-pitched vowel with a non-high-pitched vowel, resulting
in a single substitute for both \(ekādeśa\), is high-pitched. Whitney criticizes the
CA : “the treatise nowhere informs us under what circumstances a circumflex
accent arises in connection with the meeting of a final e or o and an initial a, or
even that it arises at all.” Indeed the treatise, CA \(3.2.30: एकारौकारान्तात् पूर्वः
पदादेरकारस्य\), teaches the single substitute in such cases. The present section,
headed by CA \(3.3.5\) tells us that, under certain circumstances, such combina-
tions become svaritas, and the present rule tells us that this specific combina-
tion of a high-pitched e or o with the following low-pitched a becomes a spe-
cific type of svarita, i.e. abhinihita. 
Whitney believes that the CA should have combined all this with the
fact that such a svarita combination is an exception to CA \(3.3.17\), and the fact
that the author of the CA has not done so leads Whitney to say: “We can hardly
avoid supposing that the constructors of this part of the treatise have not been
skillful enough, or careful enough, to combine the two subjects of the section
in such a manner as to give completeness to both.” There is indeed an internal
logic to the presentation of the CA rules, including the initial verses of this
section, which Whitney misses. For details, see the Note on CA \(3.3.2\).

abhinihata in the commentary Vaidikābharaṇa on TPR \(20.10\). We should
note that all the examples in the CAB, including the unattested te ’bruvan, are
found in the same order as examples 68-71 on APR \(100\). The same exam-
ples are cited in the CAB on CA 3.2.30.
Whitney notes that in parataḥ akāram ‘with a following’ the commen-
tator treats the word akāram as a neuter nominative. A nominative with
parataḥ, in the sense of ‘with x following’ or ‘x is on the other side,’ is not un-
common in Sanskrit, cf. yaḥ and parataḥ in यो बुद्धेः परतस्तु सः, Bhagavadgītā
\(3.42d\). What is uncommon is the neuter gender of the word akāra. The MB
also uses the word varṇa in both masculine and neuter genders.
३.३.७. इकारयोः प्राश्लिष्टः ।
Whitney \(3.56\). D, E, F, H, I \(corr\), J, M \(corr\), N, P: °प्राक्श्लिष्टः.
Translation: \[The svarita arising out of a combination\] of
two short i vowels is \[called\] prāśliṣṭa.
Note: While a combination of any two i vowels, long or short, results
in a long ī vowel, not all such resulting long ī vowels are evidently eligible for
the title of prāśliśṭa. The second constraint, as explained by the commentary,
and evidently implied in this case by the continuing force of CA \(3.3.5\), is that
of these two short i vowels being combined, the first one is originally high-
pitched, and the second one is originally low-pitched. Thus, this rule also
becomes an exception to CA \(3.3.17\) which says that a combination of a high-
pitched vowel with a non-high-pitched vowel, resulting in a single substitute,
becomes high-pitched.
Whitney finds that if the first high-pitched vowel is a long ī and the
following low-pitched vowel is a short i, “it is very natural that, as the more
powerful element, it should assimilate the weaker grave vowel, and make the
whole compound accute.” But the reverse situation is more problematic. “The
cases in which a long unaccented ī, on the other hand, is preceded by a short
accented í, are exceedingly rare. ... We should, however, expect that in such a

अध्याय ३, पाद ३
428
compound, especially the circumflex would not fail to appear; for if, in the fu-
sion of í and i, the grave accent of the second element is represented in the ac-
centuation of the resulting vowel, by so much the more, should this be the case
in the fusion of í \+ i, where the second element is the stronger. The teachings
of the accentual theory are so obvious and explicit upon this point that it is
hardly possible to avoid the conclusion that the Hindu grammarians, in estab-
lishing their system, overlooked or disregarded the combination í\+ī, on account
of its rarity, and that the accent of the cases later noted was made to conform to
the rule, instead of the rule being amended to fit the cases.”
Perhaps, Whitney has been a bit too impatient. First, there is no glob-
ally accepted accentual theory, which predicts results for each Vedic school,
and, as Whitney himself notes, the different schools disagree on the scope and
nature of prāśliṣṭa svarita. Given the fact that the prāśliṣṭa ranks the second
highest in hardness or sharpness of musical pitch, it seems natural that what the
early AV reciters were looking for in a prāśliṣṭa is the musical height of the
high portion of the prāśliṣṭa, rather than the prominence of the low-pitched part,
as Whitney seems to imply above.
There are major differences on the scope of prāśliṣṭa among the various
phonetic and grammatical authorities, and Whitney has eminently surveyed
these different views in his comments on the present rule.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका429
Note: Whitney \(1862: 159\) translates the end portion of the com-
mentary beginning with atīva : “in the passage átī ’va yáḥ \(ii.12.6\) - where the
krama-text would read átī ’vé’ty áti-iva - the circumflex of the ī is tairovyañjana
\(see rule 62 = CA 3.3.13\). When an ī is the result of praśleṣa, the former ele-
ment being acute and latter grave, the result of praśleṣa is always made circum-
flex. No other circumflex accent is declared to arise from the sandhi. Instances
are divR\_i\_macron\_grave ’va cákṣuḥ \(vii.26.7\), divR\_i\_macron\_grave ’va jyótiḥ \(vi.92.3\), where the krama-text
reads divR\_i\_macron\_grave ’vé ’ti diví-iva.” He is not sure of his interpretation, and thinks that
“its significance is evidently of the smallest.”
The first point to make, which apparently escaped Whitney’s attention,
is that there is a verse cited here. Secondly, the manuscript N offers the read-
ing ikārayoḥ which fits the meter better and is probably the original reading.
Third, the cited verse offers a context for CA \(3.3.5\) to be brought down to
bear on the interpretation of the present rule of the CA, indicating that CA
\(3.3.5\) is in all likelihood a genuine part of the CA. Finally, the verse adds
support to the \(3.3.7\) itself, in reinforcing the view that, in the AV tradition of
recitation, the prāśliṣṭa svarita was limited to the combination resulting from
í\+i. Finally, it says that it is always pronounced as a svarita, indicating that it is
no longer a prosodically variable syllable, but always remains svarita. The last
quarter of the verse still remains enigmatic to me.
३.३.८. अनुदात्तपूर्वात्संयोगाद्यवान्तात्स्वरितं परमपूर्वं वा जात्यः ।
Whitney \(3.57\). A, B, D: °ता स्वरि°. J: अनुदात्तात्पूर्वसंयोगा°. O reads
सरितं for स्वरितं. P: °संयोगाद्यवात्तात्स्व°.
Translation: A svarita, which follows a consonant cluster
ending in y or v, - a consonant cluster which is either preceded
by an unaccented vowel, or is not preceded by any vowel - is
\[called\] jātya.
Note: The term jātya indicates that this particular variety of svarita is an
integral part of a word, it is born with it. It is lexical, rather than born out of
discourse or prosody. Whitney notes: “no syllable in Sanskrit has an inde-
pendent circumflex accent except as it results from the conversion of an origi-
nal accented í or ú \(short or long\) into its corresponding semivowel y or v.”
The important thing to note, however, is that it arises “in connection with the
combination of syllables into words, rather than of words into a sentence.”
Thus, the jātya svarita arises as part of derivation of a word, or as a result of
internal sandhi, rather than as a result of an external sandhi \(= kṣaipra svarita\).

अध्याय ३, पाद ३
430
Whitney complains: “The definition or description of the jātya circum-
flex given by our treatise is after all imperfect, since it fails properly to distin-
guish the jātya from the kṣaipra. Such kṣaipra accents as are instanced by abhy
àrcata \(vii.82.1\), nv èténa \(v.6.5\), and the like, answer in every particular to the
defined character of the jātya. The word pade, ‘in an independent or un-
combined word,’ or something equivalent, needs to be added to the rule.”
Whitney’s problem lies in confusing his understanding of the historical
evolution of Sanskrit and its derivational morphology with the assumptions
made by the authors of the Prātiśākhya. The CA rules 3.3.8 and 3.3.9, defin-
ing the jātya and kṣaipra varieties make a very important and subtle distinction.
CA \(3.3.8\) speaks of jātya as a svarita coming after a consonant cluster ending
in y or v, and makes no reference to y and v being results of sandhi, or being
substitutes for some ‘original’ í or ú, like Whitney. Ideally, the Pratiśākhya is
not interested in internal word-derivation, and, therefore, the morph\+morph
sandhi, or internal sandhi, is of no value to it, unless it somehow participates in
pada <> samhitā transformations. Therefore, the results of the so-called
internal sandhi are not treated by the Prātiśākhya as results of any
transformation, but as given facts. In contrast with CA \(3.3.8\), the wording of
CA \(3.3.9\), defining the kṣaipra svarita, clearly makes a reference to sandhi-
transformation - antaḥsthāpatti - of í and ú into y and v before unaccented
vowels. By such a transformative process, the Prātiśākhya refers only to exter-
nal sandhi. In a word like kvà, the modern linguist may see a derivational
process from kú\+a. However, the Prātiśākhya does not call this process
antaḥsthāpatti - transformation of vowels into semivowels. It takes the form
kvà for granted, and this is what makes this type of svarita a jātya svarita ‘born
with the word.’ Thus, Whitney’s criticisms of the formulation of these rules
shows a certain lack of comprehension of the assumptions made by the CA,
which can be easily recovered from the wording of the rules. Thus, the CA
can clearly separate the jātya variety from the kṣaipra variety. While the CAB
does not make these assumptions explicit, it offers the correct examples for the
jātya and the kṣaipra varieties.

accents here treated of, not distinguishing them from the others which occur
within the limits of a word, or in the uncombined text. The rules, however, are
not without some interest, as showing that the authors of our text appreciated
the entire analogy which the circumflex accents with which they deal have with
the ordinary kṣaipra. Thus nadyàs is equivalent to nadī́.as, as nadyàsti would
be to nadī́ asti, while nadyā́i, nadyā́s represent nadī-ā́i, nadī-ā́s; the terminations
of the strong cases showing no trace of that tendency which is exhibited by the
other case-endings to draw away upon themselves the accent of the final vowel
of the theme: compare tudántam, tudántau, tudántas, with tudatā́, tudatós, tu-
datás.”

APR \(57, p. 48\), as given by Surya Kanta reads: चत्वारि क्षैप्रश्च
पञ्चपद्यामन्तोदात्तादीनि यात्. For the last portion, Surya Kanta cites the mss. vari-
ants अन्तोदात्तादीनि न्यायात्, अन्तोदातादीनि न्यायात्, and अन्तोदात्तानि दीयात्. If Surya
Kanta has reconstructed the correct reading for this APR rule, then, assuming
that a similar confusion may have taken place with our verse quoted in the
CAB, the verse could be partially restored as:
अन्तोदात्तादीनि यात् ह्रस्वनामि च यत् तथा ।
अपञ्चपद्यां वचनमुदात्तः क्षैप्र उच्यते ॥
Surya Kanta \(APR, Notes, p. 24\) offers the following interpretations
for some of the words which appear in APR \(57\): “antodāttādīni = antodāttaḥ
\(ī́\+am\) ādir yeṣāṃ tāni. yāt = through y letter \(ī́\+a = yà\), vilīḍhī́\+am= vilīḍhí-
am=yà.” With all this partial restoration, the verse still remains metrically
irregular.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका433
I propose an alternative interpretation of the verse, as it now reads in
the text given above:
‘अन्तोदात्ता नदी न्यायाद्ध्रस्वनामि च यत्तथा ।
अपञ्चपद्यां वचनमुदात्तः क्षैप्र उच्यते ॥’
“\[For\] feminine stems ending in ī́ and ū́, in accordance with the rule \[=
nyāyāt\], and \[for the feminine stems ending in\] short nāmin \[i.e. í and ú\] which
also \[occasionally\] behave like \[the feminine stems in ī́ and ū́\], in weak cases
\[= apañcapadyām\], the high-pitched vowel is pronounced. \[In strong cases =
pañcapadyām, by contrast\], a kṣaipra svarita is pronounced.”
I suspect that the word nadī in the verse is used in its Pāṇinian technical
meaning, i.e. a feminine stem ending either in ī or ū, cf. P.1.4.3 \(यू स्त्र्याख्यौ
नदी\). Here, the verse seems to refer to antodāttā nadī, “feminine stems ending
in ī́ and ū́.” I admit that this interpretation also requires a good deal of
“constructive imagination,” and I would welcome a better proposal.
३.३.११. उकारस्य सर्वत्र ।
Whitney \(3.60\): ऊकार°. P: उकारश्च°.
Translation: \[When a final\] ú \[and ū́ are transformed into v
before a low-pitched vowel\], in all cases \[i.e. strong as well as
weak cases, the low-pitched vowel is pronounced as a kṣaipra
svarita\].
Note: The major confusion regarding this rule is whether it should
read ukārasya as all the manuscripts have it, or as ūkārasya as Whitney emends
it, or something still different. Whitney says: “The manuscript reads in this
rule ukārasya, ‘if the final is u,’ but the facts seem to require the amendment to
ū, and the method of writing of our copyist is too careless to make his authority
of much weight against it.” Part of APR \(57, p. 48\) also reads ukārasya
sarvatra and is clearly a related rule. Surya Kanta \(APR, Notes, p. 24\) says
“better ūkārasya” and refers to the present CA rule, without realizing that
Whitney gave the reading ūkārasya, while his manuscript actually read
ukārasya.
The dilemma arises because if the rule is ukārasya, it will cover only the
examples in short u, while ūkārasya, as suggested by Whitney and Surya
Kanta, will cover only the examples in long ū. Among the examples cited by
the CAB, the stems tanū, camū, and vadhū end in long ū. the other hand,
the CAB cites a number of exceptions, and among these exceptions, two stems,
i.e. pr̥dāku and urvāru, end in short u, while śvaśrū ends in long ū. Somehow,

अध्याय ३, पाद ३
434
Whitney does not notice that two of these exceptions have stems ending in
short u, as he clearly acknowledges in his Index Verborum. If the rule is read
ūkārasya, then the exceptions with stems in short u do not make any sense. On
the other hand, if the rule is read ukārasya, as justified by the manuscripts, the
positive examples with stems in long ū do not make any sense. Perhaps, what
one needs is the reading uvarṇasya, which no manuscript supports.

Note: Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 60-61\) points out that the
APR \(57b\) shares with the CAB even the corrupt reading śvaśuraḥ for the re-
quired śvaśrvai. This is explainable by referring to the fact that a large number
of the mss. of the APR and the CA are found in the same bundles, are copied
by and meant for the same person. However, in this case, the two texts do not
cite all identical examples. Under ततोऽपवदति, the CAB cites the first four ex-
amples out of the five listed by the APR. In this case, even the phrase ततोऽप-
वदति is shared with the APR \(57b\). It should also be pointed out that while the
examples cited as exceptions to the rule are mostly identical in both the texts,
the positive examples are not so identical. What this perhaps indicates is that
one should not assume that the CAB directly copied its examples from the
APR. Most probably, there existed a list of gaṇas, like the Gaṇapāṭha of the
Pāṇinian tradition, which was used by both. However, where the examples
were only illustrative, and not part of a closed gaṇa, the two texts cited in-
dependent illustrations. There is no indication in the CA rule of there being
exceptions to this rule. However, the CAB and the APR both share the same
list of exceptions. Thus, it is conceivable that the original rules did not envi-
sion any such exceptions, and that the commentary reflects a changed state of
the Atharvan text.
After listing the exceptions cited by the CAB, Whitney adds: “to which
is to be added vadhvā́i \(xiv.2.9, 73\).” The gaṇa as listed in the APR already

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका435
contains this instance. Then Whitney observes: “All these exceptional forms, it
will be remarked, have a heavy ending, while those which exhibit the circum-
flex accent the ending is light in every instance but one \(tanvā̀m\).”
Whitney’s additional exceptions: “The words bāhvós \(e.g. vii.56.6\) and
ūrvós \(xix.60.2\) are instances - and, if my search has been thorough, the only
ones which the text presents - of like forms from themes in u, which are not to
be regarded as contemplated by the rule.”
३.३.१२. ओण्योश्च ।
Whitney \(3.61\). O: ॐण्योश्च.

Translation: \[The svarita\] which is separated \[from the pre-
ceding high-pitched vowel\] by consonants is called tairo-
vyañjana.
Note: Whitney observes: “There is here a notable change of subject
and of implication. We have passed without any warning, from considering
the necessary or independent circumflex to treating of that which is enclitic
only, arising, according to following rules \(rules 67-70 = CA 3.3.18-21\), in an
unaccented syllable, which is preceded by an acute, and not again immediately
followed by an acute or circumflex.” Whitney discusses other subdivisions of
this type as prescribed by other texts, e.g. tairovirāma, in which the preceding
high-pitched vowel belongs to the first member of a compound-word,

436
separated in the Padapāṭha by an avagraha, or a brief pause, for example prajā́-

resulting svarita for the low-pitched vowel is called\] pādavr̥tta.
Note: Whitney notes that the RPR calls this type vaivr̥tta, ‘arising in
connection with a hiatus,’ and further observes: “The term pādavr̥tta is evi-
dently a mutilated substitute for pādavivr̥tta or pādavaivr̥tta, ‘arising in connec-
tion with a hiatus between two words.’” Whitney’s footnote further clarifies:
“The definition of the Taitt. Pr. \(xx.6\) brings out this derivation more distinctly
than our own; we read there pada-vivr̥ttyām pādavr̥ttaḥ.” The important point
clarified by the TPR definition is that this type of svarita has to do with a hiatus
between two padas ‘words,’ rather than between two pādas ‘metrical feet.’

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका437
Note: The recitational tradition, in the context of the Padapāṭha, thus
distinguishes between a longer pause between the words which produces pro-
sodically discontinuous segments and the brief pause \(avagraha\) between
members of compound-words which does not produce prosodically discon-
tinuous segments. Of the several possible interpretations of this rule, Whitney
prefers this wider interpretation: “Notwithstanding an avagraha, the accent of a
following syllable remains just what it would be were there no such pause; a
hiatus conditioning a pādavr̥tta, and the intervention of consonants a tairo-
vyañjana.” Whitney points out that such a wider interpretation “is supported
by the authority of the Rik. Pr., which lays down the general principle \(iii.15,
r.23, ccx\) that where syllables are separated by avagraha, there accentuation is
the same as if they were connected with one another according to the rules of
sandhi.”
The CAB, on the other hand, seems to prefer a narrower interpretation,
applying only to those cases of avagraha, where a hiatus is created by splitting
the vowels apart due to an avagraha, which had been merged by sandhi in the
Saṃhitāpāṭha. Such a narrow interpretation is indicated by the kind of exam-
ples cited by the commentary.

Translation: Of \[the four types of svarita, i.e.\] abhinihita,
prāśliṣṭa, jātya, and kṣaipra, followed by a high-pitched or cir-
cumflex, a quarter-mora quantity is made to fall \[below the

अध्याय ३, पाद ३
438
normal level of low-pitch accent\], and that \[phenomenon\] is
called vikampita ‘oscillation’ by the wise.
Note: Whitney has a very long discussion on this rule, and to do full
justice to it would need a dissertation by itself. To respond to his main thrust,
Whitney seems to look at the entire discussion of the accents in the
Prātiśākhyas as a matter of grammatical theory, rather than as facts of a recita-
tional tradition. Referring to Hindu grammar, Whitney says: “Whether the
Hindu grammar is much the gainer by this intense elaboration of the accentual
theory may fairly be questioned: whether, indeed, it has not lost more than it
has gained by the exaggeration, and even the distortion, in more than one par-
ticular, of the natural inflections of the voice. To me, I must acknowledge, it
seems clear that those ancient grammarians might better have contented them-
selves with pointing out in each word the principal accent and its character,
leaving the proclitic and enclitic accents, the claimed involuntary accompani-
ments of the other, to take care of themselves; or, if they could not leave them
unnoticed, at least stating them in a brief and general way, as matters of nice
phonetic theory, without placing them on a level with the independent accents,
and drawing our a complete scheme of rules for their occurrence.” In his com-
ments, Whitney seems to foreshadow the distinction between phonetic versus
phonemic, which developed in later times, and seems to feel that the function of
the authors of the Prātiśākhyas was, or should have been, closely similar to that
of the modern grammarians of Sanskrit. Here, he completely misses the main
point of the Prātiśākhyas. They are, first and foremost, description of recita-
tional practice, rather than that of some abstract theory. Consider the distinc-
tion between pratijñā ‘doctrine’ and vr̥tti ‘recitational practice’ drawn by CA in
1.1.1. The second point missed by Whitney is that the accent as understood by
the Prātiśākhyas, and as observed in the recitational practice, is already fully
musical, and hence, in theory as well as in practice, afforded a far wider latitude
of up and down pitch movement, as compared to accent in natural speech. The
statements at the beginning of this pāda of the CA, indicate that the various
types of svarita rank differently in terms of the sharpness of the musical note
reached in their utterance. Thus, the notion of phonological redundancy of all
this phonetic or recitational detail is a peculiarly western theoretical problem,
and shows a lack of comprehension of the function of the Prātiśākhyas.
Within the description of the CA it makes eminent sense why a feeling
of vibration or kampa would be created only for some varieties of svarita than
for others. The rising portion of the different varieties of svarita rises to differ-
ent musical heights, and the first four varieties, i.e. abhinihita, prāśliṣṭa, jātya,

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका439
and kṣaipra rise higher than tairovyañjana and pādavr̥tta. Then, before a high-
pitched udātta or a svarita, with its initial rising element, the falling segment of
these four varieties of svarita the normal level of anudātta. From
this lower than the low position, the pitch then rises again to the high of the fol-
lowing udātta, or to the higher than high of the following svarita. This natu-
rally creates a feeling of vibrating or swinging up and down the musical scale.

Different manuscripts have different methods of marking accents, cf.
Witzel \(1974\) for a comprehensive discussion. The printed editions have
generally opted for the method used in the R̥gveda. For the notation of kampa,
Whitney points out: “A svarita immediately preceding an udātta cannot receive
simply the usual svarita sign, lest the following syllable be deemed a pracaya
instead of udātta. The method followed in such a case by the Rik is to append
to the circumflexed vowel a figure 1 or 3 - 1 if the vowel be short, 3 if it be
long - and to attach to this figure the signs of both svarita and of anudātta.” In
the text of the commentary below, I have placed these figures in square brack-
ets, since they do not appear in the manuscripts of the commentary, but are
provided from the printed text of the AV. Whitney has additionally given a
plausible explanation for the origin of this notation, cf. Whitney \(1862: 169\).

३.३.१८. उदात्तादनुदात्तं स्वर्यते ।
Whitney \(3.67\). J: स्वरितादनुदात्तं°.
Translation: A low-pitched vowel, following a high-pitched
\[syllable\], becomes circumflexed.
Note: The svarita or the circumflex accent defined here is the enclitic
svarita. As Whitney points out, “it is, as we have seen above \(rules 62, 63 =
CA 3.3.13-4\), subdivided into the two kinds called tairovyañjana and pāda-
vr̥tta, according as one or more consonants, or only a hiatus, intervene between
the acute vowel and its successor.”
It is to be noted here that the first element of a svarita was, for many of
its varieties, higher than the normal height of an udātta, while the anudātta pre-
ceding an udātta remained anudātta according to CA \(3.3.21\), or became lower
than the normal low according to Pāṇini, cf. P.1.2.40 \(उदात्तस्वरितपरस्य सन्नतरः\).
The printed editions of the AV follow the Pāṇinian or the R̥gvedic method of
marking the sannatara. Thus, the two most noticeable peaks of musical notes
during the recitation were the higher than the high of the svarita and the lower
than the low of the sannatara. Otherwise, for the recitational purposes, the in-
termediate high and low levels represented by the normal udātta and the normal
anudātta actually collapsed into a single level, as indicated by CA \(3.3.22\)
which says that the anudātta syllable after a svarita has the same pitch as that of
the udātta. Thus, the historical values of udātta and anudātta collapsed into an
unmarked pitch level. The initial high of the svarita moved up from this level,
and the lower-than-low of sannatara moved down from this level. Thus, from
a purely recitational point of view, the historical udātta could not be distin-
guished from the anudātta. This clearly indicates the nature of the recitational
tradition. 
Burrow \(1955: 114\) remarks: “According to the usual system, that
adopted in the R̥gveda for instance, the principle is to mark the syllable pre-
ceding the udātta, the sannatara, with a subscript line, and the dependent svarita
following the udātta by a vertical stroke above. The udātta itself is left un-
marked. ... The modern recitation of the R̥gveda follows the notational system
to the extent of pronouncing the sannatara lowest and the svarita highest musi-
cally of syllables and ignoring the udātta altogether. This is a secondary devel-
opment although it may be old, and at variance with the teachings of Pāṇini
which are in complete agreement with the findings of comparative philology.”
It is clear that Pāṇini, who specifically defines the occasion for sannatara, knew
that it was pronounced lower than the normal anudātta. Similarly, the CA, as

अध्याय ३, पाद ३
442
discussed above, knew that many varieties of svarita rose above the normal
level of udātta, and their falling levels went below the normal level of anudātta.
Similarly, the CA clearly says that the anudāttas, which follow an udātta or a
svarita have the same śruti ‘auditory quality’ as the udātta. This is a clear proof
of the unmarked udātta and unmarked anudātta having fallen together to a
common unmarked middle pitch level. While, I agree with Burrow that this is
a secondary development, it is indeed very old. To the extent it is true to the
recitational practice, one need not follow Burrow \(ibid, p. 113\) in calling the
notational system as “unnecessarily complicated.” Strictly speaking, according
to the CA description, the first part of the dependent svarita is not higher than
udātta, and the anudātta before an udātta or a svarita remains an anudātta, and
does not become sannatara, the marking system adopted by many manuscripts,
and by all the printed editions, shows the svarita with a vertical line, and the
anudātta before an udātta or a svarita with a subscript line. These markings
hint at the R̥gveda-like recitation of the AV. The AV reciters I have heard do
not distinguish the AV recitation from the RV recitation in these respects.
Thus, there may indeed be a strong RV influence on the AV recitational tradi-
tion, driving it somewhat farther away from the description of the accents as
given in the CA.

३.३.१९. व्यासेऽपि समानपदे ।
Whitney \(3.68\). A, B: व्यप्पपि°.
Translation: Even with the separation \[of words from each
other by pauses in the Padapāṭha\], within the same word, \[an
anudātta syllable following an udātta syllable is circumflexed\].
Note: As Whitney notes: “By their adhikāra \(ii.1 = CA 2.1.1\), all
rules in the second and third chapters should apply only to the saṃhitā, or
combined text; hence it must here be specifically taught that in pada, as well as
in saṃhitā, the syllable following an acute is enclitically circumflex, if the latter
be in the same word with the former, and so not separated from it by a pause or
avasāna.” The pauses between the separated words of the Padapāṭha create dis-
continuous segments, and yet, as the present rule indicates, within each word
unit, the same prosodic rules apply. This contrasts with the next rule, where an

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका443
avagraha, or a brief pause separating members of compound-words, does not
create prosodically discontinuous segments as far as accentuation is concerned.
In Whitney’s words: “Although, in the pada-text, the pause which separates
each independent word from the one following it breaks the continuity of
accentual influence, so that a final acute of the one does not render circumflex
the initial grave of the other, yet the lesser pause of the avagraha, which holds
apart the two members of a compound word, causes no such interruption; on
the contrary, an acute at the end of the former member calls forth the
circumflexed utterance in the first syllable of the latter member.” In my view, it
is not anything in the phonetic nature of the pauses that causes this behavioral
difference. As we are told by CA \(3.3.35\), all these different pauses are of one
mora duration, and hence, as durations of silence, they are identical with each
other. It must be theoretical assumptions made by the authors of the Padapāṭha
that cause this difference. In one case, one is separating words from each
other, in the other, only components of compound-words. The authors of the
Padapāṭha have assumed that the first kind of separation creates independent
units, while the second kind creates dependent units.

३.३.२१. नोदात्तस्वरितपरम् ।
Whitney \(3.70\). Ha: °स्वरिततरं°. O: नोदात्तः°.
Translation: However, \[a low-pitched \(anudātta\) syllable\],
followed by a high-pitched \(udātta\) or a circumflex \(svarita\)
syllable, is not \[circumflexed\].
Note: As Whitney explains: “A syllable originally grave remains
grave before a following udātta or svarita, even though preceded by an udātta,
and hence, by the last rules, regularly entitled to the enclitic circumflex.”
Whitney’s theoretical conclusion is as follows: “The proclitic accent thus ap-
pears, in the estimation of the Hindu phonetists, to be more powerful than the
enclitic, and the law which requires the voice to plant itself upon a low pitch in
order to rise to the tone of acute or independent circumflex to be more invio-
lable than that which prescribes a falling tone in the next syllable after an
acute.”
While according to the rule of the CA, such a syllable remains merely
anudātta, according to the RV notation used by many manuscripts and by the
printed editions, such a syllable is marked with a horizontal subscript. In
Pāṇinian terms, such a syllable becomes sannatara, with pitch lower than the
low of the anudātta. The post-CA tradition of the AV reciters seems to have
moved more in the direction of the RV in this respect.

Whitney \(3.71\): °नुदात्त उदात्त°.
Translation: A low-pitched \[syllable\], after a circumflex, as-
sumes the high-pitch \[of the udātta\].
Note: Whitney says: “All the other treatises \(R. Pr. iii. 11, r. 18, ccv;
V. Pr. iv. 138, 139; T. Pr. xxi. 10\) lay down the same principle, stating also
distinctly what must be regarded as implied in our precept, that not only the
single grave syllable which immediately follows the circumflex receives the
acute utterance, but those also which may succeed it, until, by rule 74 \(= CA
3.3.25\), the proximity of an acute or circumflex causes the voice to sink to the
proper anudātta tone.” The significance of this rule cannot be overstated. This
shows that the accentual system of the Vedic texts as they were being recited
was already on its way to major collapsing of levels, and this collapse is further
indicated by the traditional RV notation, also used for many AV manuscripts
and all the AV editions, supports this collapsing of udātta and the syllables
described in the present rule. Most other Prātiśākhyas refer to this syllable by
the term pracaya, which is sometimes used as a name for a distinct accent.
Pāṇini 1.2.39 \(स्वरितात् संहितायामनुदात्तानाम्\) provides that all low-pitched vowels
after a circumflex are pronounced with ekaśruti ‘monotone.’

Note: Whitney comments: “That is to say, again, the avagraha, or
pause of division, does not interfere with the influence of the circumflex, any
more than \(by rule 69 = CA 3.3.20\) with that of an acute, upon the following
unaccented syllables.” See the Notes on CA 3.3.19-20.

pitched.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका447
Note: In the system of accents as laid out by the CA, this is the only
kind of syllable which remains truly anudātta after all the prosodic changes are
made. The anudātta after an udātta turns into a svarita. The anudātta after a
svarita turns into an udāttaśruti ‘syllable sounding like an udātta.’ Thus, the
only anudātta which is left unaltered in this system is the one prescribed by this
rule. 
However, we should note that the Pāṇinian system, cf. P.1.2.40 \(उदात्त-
स्वरितपरस्य सन्नतरः\), treats exactly the same syllable as a sannatara syllable, i.e.
syllable with a note lower than the normal level of anudātta. The RV notation
used to mark the accents for the AV in printed editions and many manuscripts
seems to treat this syllable more like a sannatara, if indeed this is the implica-
tion of the horizontal line below the syllable.

P: किमक्षरस्य स्वर्यते. The CAB on CA \(1.4.2: स्वरोऽक्षरम्\) cites the rules CA
\(3.3.31-34\) as Sūtras to illustrate the use of the term akṣara. Thus, it would
seem that this commentary treats these as part of the text of the CA. However,
the absence of any comments on these Sūtras is perhaps an indication of their
lack of full incorporation into the text of the CA. Such a situation is perhaps to
be explained by an assumption that these were relatively recent interpolations
into the text of the CA, and that the author of the CAB had ambivalent feelings
about these rules. For further details, see the Note on CA \(1.4.2\).
Translation: Of a syllable being circumflexed, which part is
it that is circumflexed?

Note: Whitney \(1862: 174\) cannot locate any context for this whole
discussion: “In the absence of any illustrations, I am at a loss to see to what
kind of combinations this question and its answers are to be understood as ap-
plying.” It would seem that it was commonplace to think of a svarita as being
composed of two portions. It is also my guess that the verb svaryate is proba-
bly used in the sense of ‘markedly raised,’ and that it was this raising the initial
part of the svarita that was the most noticeable part of a svarita for the Indian
phoneticians and Veda reciters. For further discussion, see the Note on the
Bhārgava-Bhāskara-Vr̥tti on CA \(1.1.16\). 
३.३.३२. अर्धं ह्रस्वस्य पादो दीर्घस्येत्येके ।
Whitney \(p. 174\) quotes this as part of the commentary. B, D: अर्द्धं
स्वरस्य पादो°. H, N: पदौ for पादो. Most mss. read र्ह for ह्र.
Translation: Some say that \[the first\] half of a short vowel,
and the \[first\] quarter of a long vowel \[is circumflexed\].
Note: The doctrine here generally agrees the one stated in CA \(1.1.17\)
that the first half-mora of a svarita is high-pitched. This naturally gives the first
quarter of the long svarita vowel as being high-pitched. However, this general
view leads to the recitation of each svarita vowel as having two distinct accents
for their initial and final portions. While this is the standard view shared by
most authorities, a minority opposition is voiced in the next rule by Śāṅkha-
mitri.
३.३.३३. सर्वमिति शाङ्खमित्रिः ।
Whitney \(p. 174\) quotes this as part of the commentary.
Translation: Śāṅkhamitri says that the entire \[syllable is cir-
cumflexed\].
Note: This rule and the next represent Śāṅkhamitri’s argument against
having a svarita vowel with two parts, and he apparently proposed that the
entire syllable be pronounced with a raised pitch with no falling portion.
Śāṅkhamitri is a lone voice in Sanskrit phonetics, as no one else is known to
have expressed the same view.

Translation: \[Continuation of Śāṅkhamitri’s view?\]: \[This
should be so, since\] it is not the pattern of a \[single\] syllable to
have two accents \[within itself\]. 
Note: With the reading यद् यद् विश्वरीभावः, Whitney could only say: “A
renewed consideration affords me no new light upon this passage.” I believe
that now there is enough manuscript support for the reading I have offered, and
that it is clearly a continuation of Śāṅkhamitri’s argument why the whole of a
syllable must be circumflexed, and not just its initial segment.
३.३.३५. ऋगर्धर्चपदान्तावग्रहविवृत्तिषु मात्राकालः कालः ।
Whitney \(p. 174\) quotes this as part of the commentary. Whitney, H:

Translation: \[The pause\] at the end of a half-verse, at the end

compound-word in the Padapāṭha\], and for the hiatus \[in the
Saṃhitāpāṭha\] is of one mora duration.
Note: This is a very important rule. It is important to note that the
various pauses are phonetically identical, i.e. they are all stretches of silence
for the duration of one mora. However, they have different theoretical and re-
citational consequences. See the Note on CA \(3.3.19\).

३.४.१. ऋवर्णरेफषकारेभ्यः समानपदे नो णः ।
Whitney \(3.75\).
Translation: Within the same word, after r̥-vowels, r, and ṣ,
n is replaced with ṇ.
Note: The significant point to note is that this rule makes it quite clear
that the author of the CA does not attempt to cover consonantal r and vocalic r̥
under a common generalization. This is also clear elsewhere, cf. Note on CA
\(2.4.22\). In this respect, contrast Pāṇini 8.4.1 \(रषाभ्यां नो णः समानपदे\). In this
case, Pāṇini’s rule seems to make a generic reference to r and r̥ by just men-
tioning r. Elsewhere, Pāṇini’s practice is more like that of the CA, cf. Note on
CA \(2.4.22\). For a further discussion of this issue, see Deshpande \(1975:
159-60, notes 50-56\). 
In the formulation of the rules of the CA and Pāṇini, there is another
major difference. The CA rule assumes that the conditioning sound and the n
that undergoes cerebralization need not be contiguous. All the examples of-
fered by the CAB are of this non-contiguous type. Later rules like CA \(3.4.25:
व्यवाये शसलैः\) and CA \(3.4.26: चटतवर्गैश्च\) specify that the intervention of certain
sounds blocks the change of n to ṇ. In contrast with this, Pāṇini 8.4.1 \(रषाभ्यां
नो णः समानपदे\) assumes that the conditioning sound and the n undergoing the
change are contiguous. With this assumption, Pānini then specifies that this
change can take place even with the intervention of certain sounds, cf. P.8.4.2
\(अट्कुप्वाङ्नुम्व्यवायेऽपि\). Thus, the theoretical assumptions made by these two
texts are reverse of each other.

Translation: In drughaṇa etc., \[the change of n to ṇ takes
place\] after \[the conditioning sound in\] the preceding word \[i.e.
preceding member of the compound-expression\].
Note: The CA seems to assume a drughaṇādigaṇa. However, there is
no record of this gaṇa in the APR. Whitney, in his note on this rule, lists a
large number of examples of this type from the text of the Atharvaveda.
P.8.4.3 \(पूर्वपदात् संज्ञायामगः\) teaches a similar doctrine, though it has a few addi-
tional conditions. One of the conclusions to be derived from the very existence
of such rules is that the process of compounding was not viewed as completely
obliterating the individuality of the member words, and that the boundary be-
tween the members of a compound was often a barrier to processes like retro-
flexion. The fact that retroflexion did take place across such boundaries in
certain compound-words, but not in others, is one of the indications of the spo-
radic weakening of this boundary.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका453
Note: On the last example given by the CAB, Whitney remarks: “The
latter case, we should think, is one of somewhat ambiguous quality, since in
the form of the word, as given by the pada-text, there is nothing to show that
dur stands in the relation of pūrvapada, or former member of a compound, to
nihita, they being unseparated by avagraha.” This is not a good objection,
since, as is well known, the Padapāṭha generally shows only one separation for
a compound with more than two members. This is not a denial of other em-
bedded compounds, but a practice based on the theoretical assumption that, at a
time, we combine only two units, and the Padapāṭha only shows the final stage
of such combinations.
Whitney further says: “The same objection lies against the two preced-
ing instances; but also the much more serious one that they are examples prop-
erly belonging under rule 79 \(= CA 3.4.5\), below, the converted n being that of
a root after a preposition.” This is also not a good objection, since the true
force of CA \(3.4.5: उपसर्गाद्धातोर्नानापदेऽपि\) is conveyed by the phrase: नानापदेऽपि
“even \[when the conditioning sound appears in the preceding\] separate word.”
Compare the condition असमासेऽपि in Pāṇini 8.4.14 \(उपसर्गादसमासेऽपि णोपदेशस्य\).
The present rule does relate to the preceding word, but only in the sense of the
preceding member of a compound-expression. The KV on P.8.4.14 says: अस-
मासेऽपीति किम् । पूर्वपदाधिकारात्समास एव स्यादिति तदधिकारनिवृत्तिद्योतनार्थम् ।. The
term nānāpada in CA \(3.4.5\) refers to a sequence of uncompounded words.
Beginning with the paraphrase of this rule, the manuscript N has miss-
ing folios, except the very last folio of the manuscript. Therefore, the text of
the commentary from here on is based solely on the manuscript H.
३.४.३. अकारान्तादह्नः ।
Whitney \(3.77\). Most mss. read न्ह for ह्न.
Translation: \[The n\] of ahan \[is changed to ṇ\] after \[the ap-
propriate conditioning sound in the preceding member of the
compound\] ending in a.
Note: As Whitney notes, “Pāṇini’s rule, viii.4.7 \(ahno ’dantāt\), is
precisely coincident with this, and the illustrative citations of its scholiasts are
in good part those which our commentator gives us, and which are all strange
to the Atharvan.” One may, however, point out the intriguing contrast in the
word order. A similar contrast is seen in CA \(3.2.18: पूर्वपरयोरेकः\) and P.6.1.84
\(एकः पूर्वपरयोः\). It is not immediately clear whether such changes in the word-
order reflect some consistent principles, or whether they are purely accidental.

and sahasrāhṇyam \(e.g. 10.8.18: p. sahasra-ahnyam\), and furnishes no
counter-examples at all, so that the rule evidently finds its justification in the
observed phenomena of the general language, and not in those of the Atharva-
Veda.” For parallels to the unattested examples, see the KV on P.8.4.7

३.४.४. विभक्तयागमप्रातिपदिकान्तस्य ।
Whitney \(3.78\). A, B, D: °गमः प्राति°. Hb: °गमाप्राति°.
Translation: \[After the conditioning sound in the preceding
member of the compound-word, the change of n to ṇ also ap-
plies to the n\] of a case-ending, of the augment, and, \[to the n\]
occurring at the end of a nominal stem.
Note: This rule is a close parallel to Pāṇini 8.4.11 \(प्रातिपदिकान्तनुम्वि-
भक्तिषु च\). The rule also clearly assumes the existence of a general derivational
grammar of Sanskrit, and its morphological categories. The term prātipadika,
as defined by Pāṇini 1.2.45 \(अर्थवदधातुरप्रत्ययः प्रातिपदिकम्\), refers to the un-
derived nominal stems, and, as defined by P.1.2.46 \(कृत्तद्धितसमासाश्च\), it covers
derived nominal stems, such as verbal nouns \(kr̥danta\), secondary nouns
derived from primary nouns through affixation \(taddhita\), and compounds
\(samāsa\). The CA seems to assume the same meaning for this undefined term.
The term āgama is used here as it is used by the Pāṇinian commentators to refer
to adjunct items which are added to other items to become integral parts of
those items. Here, the term is used to refer to n in forms like durgāṇi, where
the original affix is simply i. However, by P.7.1.72 \(नपुंसकस्य झलचः\), the
nominal stem durga gets the augment nUM, before the affix i, which, by the
force of the marker M, attaches to the nominal stem after its final vowel, cf.
P.1.1.47 \(मिदचोऽन्त्यात् परः\). The sequence durgan\+i ultimately yields durgāṇi.
Here, both the CA and Pāṇini seem to assume that this augment n will not be

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका455
covered by the reference to the nominal stem or the case-ending, and must be
specifically mentioned. 
Whitney translates the term vibhakti as ‘case-ending,’ and L. Renou
\(1942: 495\) follows Whitney in interpreting this term in the present rule as:
“désigne spécialement les désinences casuelles.” However, the term theoreti-
cally covers both the case-endings as well as finite verb-endings, according to
the definition given by Pāṇini, cf. P.1.4.104 \(विभक्तिश्च\). However, the CAB
gives only an example of n as part of a case-ending, and does not offer an ex-
ample of n as part of a finite verb ending. If the rule is intended to derive
word-internal cerebralization in a form like अति तराणि \(AV 4.35.1-6\), then we
need to interpret the term vibhakti in a larger sense to include the verbal end-
ings. Here, the affix -āni of the first person singular active imperative may
need to be included in the wider notion of vibhakti. Sanskrit grammatical texts
sometimes use this term in the narrower meaning of ‘case-ending,’ as for ex-
ample APR \(59: एकारो विभक्तयादेशश्छन्दसि\). L. Renou \(ibid. p. 495\) also notes
the wider usage of this term in the ancient grammatical literature. If the condi-
tion पूर्वपदस्थान्निमित्तात् is assumed to continue into this rule, as suggested below,
then we do not need this rule to account for forms like tarāṇi, and we may be
correct in choosing the narrower interpretation for the word vibhakti as case-
endings.
There is another significant question concerning the interpretation of
this rule. The commentary CAB does not expressly continue the phrase
पूर्वपदस्थान्निमित्तात् into this rule. On the other hand, the KV on P.8.4.11 \(प्रातिपदि-
कान्तनुम्विभक्तिषु च\) continues this expression into this rule. This makes one
wonder whether the interpretation as offered by the commentary needs to be
amended. Such a condition is needed to explain the form paryāyiṇaḥ in AV
\(6.76.4\), which is split in the Padapāṭha as: pari-āyinaḥ. Also, in the example
durgāṇi in AV \(7.63.1\), the Padapāṭha breaks it down to duḥ-gāni. Though the
word svargeṇa is not attested in the AV, the word svarga is analyzed by the
Padapāṭha as svaḥ-ga, \(e.g. AV 9.5.16\). In all these examples, the condition-
ing sound, i.e. r, belongs to the previous member of the compound expression.
Only the example varāheṇa is not split by the Padapāṭha, and hence does not
present the same situation. However, the commentator may have an etymology
for the word varāha in mind where the r belongs to the first member of a com-
pound expression. Indeed, such an etymology is proposed by Yāska in his
NR. Yāska \(NR, V.4\) cites a Brāhmaṇa passage: वरमाहारमहार्षीदिति हि ब्राह्मणम्,
and derives the word from vara\+āhāra, cf. Siddheshwar Varma \(1953: 36,
171\). The KV seems to assume that, if the conditioning sound is in the same
word, one does not need a separate rule, but can manage with the basic rules

अध्याय ३, पाद ४
456
P.8.4.1 \(रषाभ्यां नो णः समानपदे\) and P.8.4.2 \(अट्कुप्वाङ्नुम्व्यवायेऽपि\). However, if
the conditioning sound is in the previous member of the compound-word, then
P.8.4.11 is needed. All the examples offered by the KV are compound-words.
I suspect that the CA has a similar interpretation intended for this rule,
something that is not clearly stated by the CAB, but assumed by the examples
offered in it.

that this may have occurred in the genuine Śaunakīya recension of the AV, and
that the Vulgate is not the genuine Śaunakīya recension. The expression
svargāṇām is found in the Kāṭhaka-Saṃhitā \(33.6\).
३.४.५. उपसर्गाद्धातोर्नानापदेऽपि ।
Whitney \(3.79\). B, C, D: °र्ग्रा°. O: °पदेष्वपि.
Translation: After \[a conditioning sound in\] a pre-verb
\(upasarga\), even if \[the conditioning sound happens to be\] in a
separate word \[i.e. uncompounded pre-verb, the n\] of a verb
root \[is replaced with a ṇ\].
Note: The phrase नानापदेऽपि in this rule has the same force as the
phrase असमासेऽपि in P.8.4.14 \(उपसर्गादसमासेऽपि णोपदेशस्य\). For a further discus-
sion of this condition, see the Note on CA \(3.4.2\). The other important
difference between Pāṇini and the CA rule is that the CA rule is phrased as a
general rule for all verbs with n. Pāṇini takes a different path. He first makes a
distinction between verbs with n which is not likely to change and verbs with n
which is likely to change. The second class of verbs are listed in the
Dhātupāṭha already with a retroflex ṇ, and these verbs are called ṇopadeśa,
verbs taught with retroflex ṇ. Then Pāṇini unconditionally converts this retro-
flex ṇ to dental n, for all normal contexts, cf. P.6.1.65 \(णो नः\). Then, P.8.4.14

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका457
reconverts this n to ṇ, after a conditioning sound in a pre-verb. Perhaps, since
the CA was concerned only with the roots as they occurred in the text of the
AV, it did not feel the need to make such large classes, cf. Whitney on this
rule: “The initial n of a root it almost always cerebralized by the preceding
preposition in the Atharvan.”
Whitney further says: “the only exceptions are the combinations of
nabh with pra \(vii.18.1, 2\), and of nart with pari \(e.g. iv.38.3\) and pra \(e.g.
viii.6.11\).” The first of these exceptions, i.e. pra\+nabh is taken care by CA
\(3.4.18: नभेः\) which was not available to Whitney. The exception of pari\+nr̥t is
taken care of by the inclusion of the root nr̥t in the kṣubhnādi gaṇa mentioned
in CA \(3.4.24: क्षुभ्नादीनाम्\), and the CAB on that rule cites examples of pra\+nr̥t
without retroflexion of n.

Note: Surya Kanta says that this rule should give us a retroflexion
even in pra nabhasva \(AV 7.18.1, 2\), pari nr̥tyati \(AV 4.38.3\), and parinr̥ty-
antaḥ \(AV 8.6.11\). However, as Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 39\)
points out, all mss. retain n in all these passages. Surya Kanta concludes: “It is
obvious that the CA. is prescribing saṃdhis, which must have been current in
the Śaunaka school; these are not observed by the Vulgate mss.; hence Vulgate
is not Śaunakīya.” The cases of pra\+nabh and pari\+nr̥t are now meaningfully
taken care of, without the assumptions made by Surya Kanta, cf. See the Note

टौस्स्वेनः\). However, while the word enaḥ in Pāṇini’s rule is a nominative from
the base ena, in the present CA rule, the context requires us to read enaḥ as a
genitive form, evidently from the base en. The CAB clearly takes it as a
genitive: उत्तरस्य एनो नकारस्य.

Note: While the mss. H reads the counter-example as paryeṇān,
Whitney corrects it to paryenān, without mentioning the actual reading in the
mss. It is quite clear that, as the intended counter-example to the rule, it must
read paryenān. However, it is to be noted that the passage as cited under APR
\(28, p. 26, example 13\) reads paryeṇān. Whitney’s edition of the AV reads
paryenān, perhaps under the influence of our CA rule. Whitney’s mss. mostly
supported his reading, though there was one deviant ms. Whitney \(AV Transl.
Vol.II., p. 522\) says: “O. reads páry eṇān in d; but the passage is quoted under
Prāt. iii. 80 \(= CA 3.4.6\) as one in which the lingualization of n does not take
place.” This case seems to have escaped Surya Kanta’s attention. However, it
would seem that the Vulgate of the AV in this case did follow the CA rule, ex-
cept the ms. O. It is also interesting to note that the commentary on the CA
clearly intended to give the form paryenān, and yet the copyist, under the influ-
ence of the general grammatical tradition, offered the form paryeṇān. Thus, the
apparent misreading in the manuscript H may be an indication of the influence
of the general rules of Sanskrit grammar on the copyists, even when the tradi-
tion of the AV mss. in this case retained the non-retroflexed form.
Referring to the missing rules which were not known to Whitney in
1862, he adds: “Perhaps the treatise next took note of another case which the
text affords of the lingualization of the nasal of ena, viz. ā jabhārāi ’ṇām
\(v.31.10\). Possibly there followed also a mention of the passage asr̥jan nir
eṇasaḥ \(ii.10.8\); but this is very questionable, as the reading itself is doubtful.”
In both of these examples, the VVRI edition shows that the cerebralized read-
ing is supported by the majority of manuscripts.

३.४.७. नसश्च ।
Missing in Whitney and H. No CAB on CA 3.4.7-12. This is a case
of missing text, though most likely these rules originally did have the com-
mentary. This is clear from the fact that the manuscript jumps from प्रपराभ्यामेनः
to पुनर्णयामसि, though there is no commentary on the latter rule. Whitney \(1862:
178\) tries to guess what these missing rules may have looked like: प्रपरिभ्यां नः
and आशीरुरुष्यगृहेषुशिक्षेभ्यश्च. However, the missing rules, as now known from
the other manuscripts are somewhat different from Whitney’s guesses.
Translation: Also, \[the n\] of nas \[= naḥ, is cerebralized after
the conditioning sound in the preceding pre-verb \(upasarga\)\].
Note: In the absence of a commentary on this rule, one can only
speculate about what the rule means. As Whitney \(1880: 163\) has astutely
noted, this rule along with the two next rules “have the aspect of representing
the three items of a rule of Pāṇini, naś ca dhātusthoruṣubhyaḥ \(viii.4.27\).” We
may perhaps also bring in the next rule of Pāṇini, P.8.4.28 \(उपसर्गाद्बहुलम्\). 
Whitney \(1880: 163\) assumes that the expression praparābhyām con-
tinues into this rule, and then he remarks: “The first rule, nasaś ca, must mean
‘the n of naḥ also is changed to ṇ after pra and parā.’ So far as pra is con-
cerned, this is well enough; the cases of pra ṇaḥ are twelve in the Atharvan. ...
But the text offers no example of naḥ after parā; while, on the other hand, there
are eight cases ... in which naḥ follows pari and is changed to ṇaḥ, all the
manuscripts agreeing. The form of rule 80 \(= CA 3.4.6\), then, as here implied,
needs absolutely to have been praparibhyām, instead of praparābhyām. How
to get over the difficulty I do not see. We cannot amend rule 80 \(= CA 3.4.6\)
to praparibhyām, because there is in the Atharvan a single case of eṇ after parā,
and a single phrase \(repeated\) in which it remains en after pari; both are quoted
by the commentator under rule 80 \(= CA 3.4.6\).”
The other most plausible way is the follow the lead given by Pāṇini as
mentioned above. If we take into account P.8.4.28 \(उपसर्गाद्बहुलम्\), which says
that naḥ is diversely cerebralized after a conditioning sound in the preceding
upasarga, a similar interpretation is suggested for the present CA rule. To get
at that, we may continue the generic condition upasargāt from CA \(3.4.5\), in-
stead of the limited condition praparābhyām. This, effectively allows us a
wider interpretation for the rule to take care of the difficulties mentioned by
Whitney. 
One may also passingly mention that the cerebralization of naḥ after
pari is ascribed by the VPR \(3.87: परि ण इति शाकटायनः\) specifically to

अध्याय ३, पाद ४
460
Śākaṭāyana. This means that it was not a universal phenomenon, and the inci-
dence of pari ṇaḥ in the AV text could possibly be due to the AV reciters fol-
lowing the lead of Śākaṭāyana, as they expressly aknowledge elsewhere, cf.
Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary on CA \(1.1.10\). 
३.४.८. धातुस्थादयकारात् ।
Missing in Whitney and H. F: °स्थाद्यकारात्. I: °स्थात्षकारात्. P has no
daṇḍa between this and the next rule. All other manuscripts read: धातुस्थादय-
कारात्.
Translation: \[The n of nas is cerebralized\] after \[the appro-
priate conditioning sound\] in the verb root which is not com-
bined with y.
Note: We do not have the commentary on this rule, and the rule
seems to present major difficulties of interpretation. After discovering this rule
in a second manuscript of the CA, Whitney \(1880: 164\) says: “There remains
the rule dhātusthād ayakārāt, which can hardly signify anything else than ‘after
an altering letter contained in a root, unless combined with y,’ and must be
understood as applying only to naḥ. But the only case of altered n in the text
falling under the rule as thus understood is śikṣā ṇo asmin \(xviii.3.67\) : all the
manuscripts read ṇo. But the specification ayakārāt, if I interpret it correctly,
can only be intended to exclude uruṣya \(vi.4.3\); and there all the saṃhitā MSS.
save E. give uruṣyā ṇaḥ, which has accordingly been received into the edited
text.” Here one may point out that the VVRI edition, while it follows Whitney
in giving the reading uruṣyā ṇo, mentions two more manuscripts, B and K, as
giving the reading uruṣyā naḥ. Since, we have at least three manuscripts pro-
viding the reading uruṣyā naḥ, one needs to seriously consider the possibility
that the author of the CA knew the reading uruṣyā naḥ, and tried to exclude it
from cerebralization with the condition ayakārāt.
Whitney further says: “And, on the other hand, we have mīmr̥ṣo naḥ at
iii.15.4, and rīriṣo naḥ at xi.2.29, in which ṇ is not read by a single manu-
script.” Even the VVRI edition does not have any manuscripts reading ṇ in
these cases, and, one wonders how the present rule would exclude these,
unless one makes an assumption that the author of the CA knew these
examples with ṇaḥ. I am not certain we have enough evidence at this point to
be able to draw any firm conclusions. 
One may also mention a remote possibility concerning these two in-
stances. P.8.4.28 \(उपसर्गादनोत्परः\), as read by the MB, offers a view that naḥ

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका461
preceded by a conditioning sound in an upasarga, which is not followed by an
o, changes to ṇa. The instance offered by the MB is pra\+u\+naḥ > pro naḥ,
without cerebralization. One wonders whether the fact that the forms mīmr̥ṣo
and rīriṣo end in o in the Samhitāpāṭha may have, at some point in the oral
transmission, led to a similar exclusion of cerebralization of naḥ. Again, this is
simply a speculation, and needs further research. The rule P.8.4.28 is read as
\(उपसर्गाद्बहुलम्\) by the KV, and hence the text of the rule itself is to some extent
uncertain.
Whitney \(1880: 165\) discusses further possible complications with the
interpretation of the term dhātusthāt, but these cannot be resolved in the present
state of the manuscript variants. 
One may also note that the manuscript I offers a significant variant for
the rule: धातुस्थात् षकारात्. If this has any validity, it may then eliminate those
examples pointed out by Whitney \(1880: 165\), where the root contains an r as
a possible conditioning sound for the change of naḥ to ṇaḥ. The only examples
for dhātusthāt offered in the KV under P.8.4.27 are examples involving ṣ.
However, the manuscript I is the only manuscript with this reading.
३.४.९. उरु ।
Missing in Whitney and H. 
Translation: \[The n of naḥ is cerebralized after the word\]
uru.
Note: Most manuscripts offer the reading urū. However, a compari-
son of this rule with the wording of P.8.4.27 \(नश्च धातुस्थोरुषुभ्यः\) leads me to
choose the short u reading uru. Whitney \(1880: 164\) points to a possible di-
lemma with this rule: “The rule uru affords fewer difficulties of interpretation.
But the only passage in which naḥ, or any other word beginning with n,
follows uru, is uru naḥ kr̥ṇota \(v.3.6\), where P.M., to be sure, have ṇaḥ, but
E.I.H. read naḥ, which was received into the edited text, because the passage is
found also in the Rig-Veda, and is expressly exempted by the Rik. Prāt. \(v. 27\)
from the operation of the rule requiring in general ṇaḥ after uru \(v. 26\). If this
rule of our own treatise is to be respected, the correct Atharvan reading is uru
ṇaḥ.” While the VVRI edition gives uru naḥ for its choice of reading, it men-
tions several additional manuscripts which have uru ṇaḥ for this passage, i.e.
A, D, Km, R, Sm. It is thus most likely, as Whitney suggests, that the original
Atharvan reading known to the author of the CA was uru ṇaḥ. It was changed
to uru naḥ by some reciters, perhaps under the pressure of the RV tradition.

Whitney further adds: “Possibly urūṇasau \(xviii.2.13\), which I had re-
garded as included in the gaṇa of rule 76 \(= CA 3.4.2\), is to be brought under
the present precept.” The drughaṇādi gaṇa mentioned in CA \(3.4.2\) is not
listed in the APR and hence its membership cannot be verified.
३.४.१०. ब्रह्मण्वत्यादीनाम् ।
Missing in Whitney and H. I: 10. O reads म्ह for ह्म. P has no daṇḍa

Translation: \[The n\] in the forms brahmaṇvatī etc. \[is

Note: Whitney \(1880: 163\), who found this rule in the second manu-
script which became available to him after the publication of his edition in
1862, remarks: “Of the remaining rules, one, brahmaṇvatyādīnām, is clear
enough in its bearing; it applies to the cases \(referred to also in iv.99 = CA
4.3.28, and there rehearsed in the note\) in which, against iii.89 = CA 3.4.21, a
n becomes ṇ \(in pada as well as saṃhitā text\) even when final.” Some idea of
what kind of examples are included in this class can be gained from the CAB
on CA \(4.3.28\):

३.४.११. निपातस्य स्वः ।
Missing in Whitney and H. C, E, F, I: निपातस्य°. I \(corr\): निपातस्वः. O:
निपातस्य रवः. Remaining mss. read: निपातश्च स्वः .
Translation: After \[lit. ‘of’\] the particle su \[or rather, when it
appears as ṣu, the n of naḥ changes to ṇ\].
Note: The syntax of this rule is quite confusing. Whitney \(1880:
163-4\) says: “It appears capable of meaning only ‘of the particle su,’ while it
ought to mean ‘after ṣu, when particle,’ and so to read nipātāt ṣvaḥ.” An origi-
nal nipātāc ca could have been conceivably altered through scribal error to

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका463
nipātaś ca or nipātasya as we find in the manuscripts. In any case, Whitney’s
guess that the rule has to do with the particle su, or when it appears as ṣu, de-
rives added support from P.8.4.27 \(नश्च धातुस्थोरुषुभ्यः\). The rule deals with
three conditions, dhātustha, uru, and ṣu. Of these three conditions, the first and
the second are taken care of by CA \(3.4.8-9\), and the remaining ṣu is taken
care of by the present rule. As Whitney \(1880: 163\) notes, the reference to ṣu
as a nipāta is necessary to avoid cerebralization of naḥ in a case like gr̥heṣu
naḥ. The rule thus takes care of the commonly found sequence ṣu ṇaḥ. The
parallel rule of Pāṇini clearly applies only to naḥ after ṣu, and not to any other
n-initial word after ṣu. Whitney \(1880: 164\), however, argues that the inter-
vention of ब्रह्मण्वत्यादीनाम् between CA \(3.4.8-9\) and the present rule “seems to
dissociate it from naḥ, and mark it as applying to any word whatever with ini-
tial n.” However we interpret the rule, there are some major problems in re-
lating the rule to the phenomena found in the text of the AV. As Whitney
notes: “There is then the further and not unimportant objection that no example
of ṇ for n after ṣu is to be found in the text \(of the AV\). The altered ṣu is not
once followed by naḥ; the only initial n that comes in contact with it is at
xviii.1.37, where we have stuṣa ū ṣu nr̥tamāya, not a single manuscript reading
ṇr̥tamāya. Unless, therefore, all the manuscripts are wrong here, and we have
to alter to ṇr̥tamāya, I cannot see what purpose this rule answers.” One can
only say that in this case, the author of the CA is simply attempting to imitate
some generic grammar of Sanskrit, such as represented by P.8.4.27. The cases
of naḥ changing to ṇaḥ after ṣu are common in the RV, and are cited by the
commentators under P.8.4.27.
This rule seems to have been mistakenly applied to the sequence gr̥heṣu
naḥ by some transmitters. Whitney \(1880: 164\) says: “the phrase ... occurs
twice in the Atharvan, most of the manuscripts reading each time ṇaḥ. I think
that, in view of the absence of authority for this reading in the Prātiśākhya, the
adoption of naḥ in the edited text is to be approved.” Also see Whitney’s note
on this rule \(W: iii.80\).

अध्याय ३, पाद ४
464
Note: The rule takes care of the sequence पुनर्णयामसि in AV \(5.14.7\).
Beginning with CA \(3.4.6\), the manuscript H jumped to this rule, skipping the
intermediate text: प्रपराभ्यामेर्णयामसि, and, on the basis of his knowledge of the
AV, Whitney reconstructed the rule as पुनर्णयामसि. On this reconstruction,
Whitney \(1862: 178\) remarked: “Whether I have given the form of the rule cor-
rectly is not quite certain, a portion of it being lost altogether.” Now, all the
newly found manuscripts of the CA support Whitney’s reconstructed text.
३.४.१३. नवतेश्च ।
Whitney \(3.82\).
Translation: \[The n\] of the root nu \[is cerebralized after pu-
nar\].
Note: All the examples cited by the commentator contain the word
nava ‘new,’ rather than any verb-forms from the root nu. Whitney observes:
“The authors of our treatise, then, must have derived nava, ‘new,’ from the
verbal root nu, ‘to praise,’ instead of from the pronominal word nu, ‘now.’”
Yāska’s Nirukta \(III.19\) derives nava from ā\+nayati. Siddheshvar Varma
\(1953: 120\) says: “But Indo-Eur. neuos, ‘new,’ Gr. néos ‘new.’”
Kṣīrasvāmin’s commentary on Amarakośa \(3.77\) derives nava from nu, and
this is further supported by his commentary Kṣīrataraṅgiṇī on Pāṇini’s
Dhātupāṭha, which derives the words nava and praṇava from the root nu \(= ṇu
of the Dhātupāṭha\) by applying the Uṇādisūtra : नुदंशोर्गुणश्च \(rule 6.54,
Daśapādī-Uṇādisūtra\), Kṣīrataraṅgiṇī \(p. 173\). Thus, it is clear that a deriva-
tion for the word nava from the root nu is well established in the Indic tradi-
tion. While the word nava can be technically derived by the general rule
P.3.3.57 \(ऋदोरप्\) by adding the affix aP to the root nu, there is no specific rule
relating to the derivation of nava in Pāṇini.

Note: On AV \(8.1.20\), Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.II., p. 475\) notes
that the citation here is similar with RV \(10.161.5\), except that the RV has the

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका465
vocative punarnava without a retroflex ṇ, a reading which it shares with AVP
\(16.2.9\), as well as with Sāyaṇa’s commentary on AV \(8.1.20\). The lack of
retroflexion in the RV reading may indicate that it is the earlier reading, rela-
tively less affected by the increasingly greater pressure for retroflexion. For
the question of retroflexion in the RV, see: Deshpande \(1979\).
३.४.१४. पूर्याणः ।
Whitney \(3.83\). E, F, I, O: दूर्याणः.
Translation: \[After the word\] pūr, \[the n of the word\] yāna
\[is cerebralized\].
Note: The compound-expression pūryāṇa \(AV 18.1.54\) is split into
pūḥ-yāna by the Padapāṭha. Whitney observes: “There is small reason to be
seen for singling out this word in order to make it the subject of a special rule,
and the same is true of those treated in the two following rules: they might all
have been as well left to fall into the gaṇa of rule 76.” Since this gaṇa is not
fully listed in the APR, we have no exact way of ascertaining its membership
as intended by the CA or by its commentators.
The commentary of \[Pseudo-\]Sāyaṇa on AV derives the word pūryāṇa
from pums\+yāna, and then says that the word is grammatical because of its
inclusion in the pr̥ṣodarādi gaṇa referred to in P.6.3.109 \(पृषोदरादीनि
यथोपदिष्टम्\). However, the tradition considers this list to be an open-ended list
\(ākr̥tigaṇa\), and this is simply a way of saying that this is an irregular forma-
tion. It is unlikely that the word is actually derived from puṃs\+yāna.
Whitney, I think quite correctly, renders this word as “\(the roads\) that go to the
stronghold.” In his note on AV \(18.1.54\), \(AV Translation, Volume II, p.
828\), Whitney says: “The commentary absurdly explains the word as =
pumāṃso yena ... yānti\! for the pur, compare x.2.28 ff.; xix.17 and 19.” The
phrase puram praimi appears in each verse of AV \(19.17\), and the phrase pu-
ram pra ṇayāmi occurs in each verse of AV \(19.19\). Whitney, \(AV Transla-
tion, Volume II, p. 828\), further points out, “The Anukr. takes no notice of the
metrical irregularity in the verse.” To this comment, Lanman adds: “It is due to
the displacement of pūrviébhis by pūryāṇais : the secondary character of the
latter \(occurring elsewhere only at 18.4.63 below\) is palpable in more ways
than one.” 
Commenting on pūryāṇaiḥ in AV \(18.4.63\), Whitney points out that
MS \(i.10.3\) reads pūrvyebhiḥ for our pūryāṇaiḥ, while the ĀŚS \(ii.7.9\), “with
K. and Kap. S., as pointed out by Schröder” \(AV Translation , Vol. II, p. 889\),

अध्याय ३, पाद ४
466
reads pūrviṇebhiḥ. One may suggest the possibility that the reading
pūrviṇebhiḥ indicates a possible transition between pūrvyebhiḥ and pūryāṇaiḥ.

Note: What case is yāno in yāno nakārasya in the commentary, a
genitive for yān? The rule itself simply seems to cite the word pūryāṇa in the
nominative. However, probably under the influence of the clear genitive in
durṇāṃnaḥ, the commentator interprets -yāṇaḥ as a genitive. For a similar
question, see the note on CA \(3.4.6: प्रपराभ्यामेनः\).

Note: The KV on P.8.4.26 \(छन्दस्यृदवग्रहात्\) cites passages with the
same expressions, i.e. pitr̥yāṇa and nr̥maṇā. The KV interprets this rule to
suggest that this change takes place only if the first part containing the sound r̥
is liable to be separated with an avagraha in the Padapāṭha. The rule does not
mean that this change occurs in the Padapāṭha, even when the members are ac-
tually separated with an avagraha. The Padapāṭha for these examples separates
their components with an avagraha, and then does not show retroflexion, e.g.
pitr̥yāṇa < pitr̥-yāna, nr̥maṇā < nr̥-manā. Thus the Padamañjarī on the KV on
P.8.4.26 says: अवग्रहणभूतो य ऋकारस्तदन्तादिति । संहिताधिकाराच्च संहिताकाल
एतेषां णत्वं, पदकाले चावग्रहः क्रियते, तेनावग्रहयोग्यत्वादृकारोऽवग्रह इत्युक्तः, न तु तद्दशा-
पन्नः । तथा चावग्रहं दर्शयता णत्वं न प्रयुक्तम्. The commentary Nyāsa clarifies the
dilemma even better: अपरे तु मन्यन्ते - यथानृत्यन्नपि नर्तनयोग्यत्वान्नर्तक इत्युच्यते,
तथानवगृह्यमाणोऽपि ऋकारोऽवग्रहयोग्यत्वादवग्रह इत्युक्तः । अत एतदुक्तं भवति - अवग्रहयो-
ग्यादृकाराण्णत्वं भवति, एवं सत्यवग्रहग्रहणे संहिताधिकारात् संहितायामेव णत्वं भवति, नाव-
ग्रहादिति. 
Whitney mentions nr̥pāṇa \(AV xix.58.4\) as an additional example.
However, neither Whitney, nor the commentator on CA, nor Pāṇini offers a
counter-example, i.e. an example where n does not change to ṇ, because the
previous member, though ending in r̥, is not separable with an avagraha.
The wording of Pāṇini’s rule indicates that not only was he familiar
with the Padapāṭhas, but that at least some of his rules were indented for
building up the Saṃhitā text starting from the Padapāṭha.
३.४.१७. न मिनन्ति ।
Whitney \(3.86\): °मिनाति. E, F, I: प्रमिनंति. I \(corr\): °मिनातेः. O offers

\(अ.वे. १८.४.६०\)।
Note: Whitney points to an additional example pramināma vratāni
\(xix.59.2\). He further observes: “The rule itself is to be understood, it may be
presumed, as giving exceptions to rule 79 \(= CA 3.4.5: उपसर्गाद्धातोर्नानापदेऽपि\)
above: yet the latter would seem to apply only to conversions of the nasal of a
root itself, and not of the appended conjugational syllable.” Whitney’s concern
seems to be fully justified, especially when we find Pāṇini making a separate
rule to take care of the forms prahiṇoti and pramīṇāti, cf. P.8.4.15 \(हिनुमीना\).
This rule may be taken as an indication that under normal circumstances, the n
of the infixes nu, nā etc. is not cerebralized. On the other hand, the CA rule as
an exception would imply that such infixes would be cerebralized by the
normal rules, unless their cerebralization is specifically prevented. This may
perhaps suggest that by the term dhātu in CA \(3.4.5\), the author of the CA may
have intended the verbal base before the final endings. This is further
supported by the fact that CA \(4.3.24: हिनोतेः\), as well as APR \(147c: हिनोतेः, p.
100\), already take for granted the fact of cerebralization in forms like
pratiprahiṇmaḥ, \(AV 10.1.5\) and simply point out that the cerebral in these
forms is not restored to dental in the Padapāṭha. Neither of these treatises have
a separate rule like P.8.4.15 \(हिनुमीना\) prescribing cerebralization of the infix.
Also comparable is the prohibitory rule CA \(3.4.20: परेर्हिनोतेः\), which presumes
that without such a rule, the cerebralization will take place in pari hinoti.
All the examples cited in the CAB are found as examples 62-64 on
APR \(147h\).

Note: It is difficult to understand why Whitney did not include this
rule in spite of the fact that at least an incomplete commentary on this rule
exists in the manuscript H. After consulting a second manuscript of the CA,
however, Whitney \(1880: 165\) acknowledged his “want of acuteness,” and
cited the examples pra nabhasva and pra nabhatām \(vii.18.1, 2\). Also see the
Note on CA 3.4.5 concerning some misconceptions of Surya Kanta which are
now corrected by the discovery of this rule.
APR \(147h, p. 102\) lists pra nabhasva \(AV 7.18.1\) and pra nabhatām
\(AV 7.18.2\) as exceptions to cerebralization, and it is obvious that these are the
same cases intended by the present CA rule.

Note: The CAB offers two examples to illustrate this phenomenon.
The first example seems to be a genuine example for this rule, because the
cerebralization of n would otherwise take place by CA \(3.4.2\). One may,
however, wonder why this could not be taken care of by simply excluding this
instance from the drughaṇādi list referred to in that rule. The only conclusion
one can draw is that the CA list was not a complete list, but simply an open-
ended list hinted by the token drughaṇa. This is what occasions the present
rule. 
On the other hand, the example pra bhānavaḥ sisrate \(AV 13.2.46\), as
Whitney himself noted, “cannot be forced under any rule that has been laid
down.” This is because, the pre-verb pra is not semantically related to
bhānavaḥ, but to the verb sisrate. Therefore, there is no possibility of pra cere-
bralizing the n of bhānavaḥ.
One may note a curious fact, corroborating the criticism above, that the
APR \(147h, p. 102\) lists only the example citrabhāno in its list of exceptions to
cerebralization, and makes no mention of pra bhānavaḥ sisrate.

Note: The form pari hinomi \(AV 8.4.6\) is listed among the excep-
tions to cerebralization under APR \(147h, p.102\). Whitney reminds us: “A
strict application of rule 79 = CA \(3.4.5: उपसर्गाद्धातोर्नानापदेऽपि\), then, to the
nasal only of a root itself, would render this rule also unnecessary.” But, then
how would one get the cerebral ṇ in the attested counter-examples, where
Whitney indeed admits the presence of cerebral ṇ? For theoretical issues re-
lating to the assumptions behind this and other similar rules, see the Note on
CA \(3.4.17: न मिनन्ति\). The counter-example pra hiṇomi \(AV 12.2.8\) is also
listed under APR \(147c, p. 100\) among examples where in the Padapāṭha, the
cerebralization does not revert to the dental original. Other forms listed are
pratiprahiṇmaḥ \(AV 10.1.5\) and pra hiṇuta \(AV 18.4.40\).

न्द॑नः’ \(अ.वे. ५.२०.९\)। ‘पाशो॑ ग्र॒न्थिः’ \(अ.वे. ९.३.२\)।
Note: Whitney points out: “To the first part of this rule would need to
be made the exceptions noted at iv. 99 \(= CA 4.3.28: ब्रह्मण्वत्यादीनाम्\), but that,
by the operation of that precept, they are made to read in pada as in saṃhitā,
and so are withdrawn from the ken of the Prātiśākhya.” There is a positive

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका471
precept now in CA \(3.4.10: ब्रह्मण्वत्यादीनाम्\), which was not available to Whitney
when he prepared his edition which prescribes the change of word-final n in
certain exceptional cases. However, we should note that in all those cases, the
n occurs at the end of the first member of a compound word, and not at the ab-
solute end of the word as in the case of pūṣan in AV \(7.9.3\) cited by the com-
mentary.
The first condition stated in this rule of the CA is taken care of by
Pāṇini with a specific rule, P.8.4.37 \(पदान्तस्य\), with identical import. As far as
the second condition is concerned, Pāṇini’s grammar handles the absence of
cerebralization in a very different way. In an example like granthi, P.8.3.24
\(नश्चापदान्तस्य झलि\) converts the non-final n to an anusvāra before non-nasal
stops and spirants. This form graṃthi is then changed back to granthi by
P.8.4.58 \(अनुस्वारस्य ययि परसवर्णः\) which says that an anusvāra is replaced by a
consonant homorganic with the following non-spirant consonant. By the con-
vention set by P.8.2.1 \(पूर्वत्रासिद्धम्\), the cerebralization rule, P.8.4.1 \(रषाभ्यां नो
णः समानपदे\), considers only the results of the preceding rules as having taken
effect, and does not consider the results of the succeeding rules as having taken
effect. Thus, for P.8.4.1, the form granthi has not been brought into existence.
It still sees the form graṃthi, to which cerebralization of n cannot apply, be-
cause there is no n in that form. This complicated logic, system-internal as it is,
is explained by Bhaṭṭojī Dīkṣita with reference to the form kurvanti in his SK
on P.8.4.58 \(SK, p. 29\): कुर्वन्तीत्यत्र णत्वे प्राप्ते तस्यासिद्धत्वादनुस्वारे परसवर्णे च कृते

Note: With respect to this rule, Whitney says: “it belongs rather to the
general grammar than to a Prātiśākhya of the Atharvan, since our text does not
furnish a single case to which it should apply.” However, the counter-example
is indeed attested in the text of the AV, i.e. durṇaśaṃ cid arvāk \(AV 5.11.6\),
and it is possible that the existence of the counter-example occasioned the pres-
ence of the rule, which, as Whitney rightly says, comes from a general gram-
mar of Sanskrit. We should noted that the APR \(147h, p.102\), which provides
a list of exception to cerebralization makes no mention of these examples, per-
haps for a simple reason that they do not occur in the text of the AV.
This rule is identical with P.8.4.36. For parallel examples, see the KV
on P.8.4.36. An example to the contrary is found in the TS 2.4.4.1
\(nirnāśaya\).
३.४.२३. स्वरलोपे हन्तेः ।

‘र॒क्षो॒हणं॑ वा॒जिन॑म्’ \(अ.वे. ८.३.१\)।
Note: Whitney observes: “Unless sparśayukta, in rule 89 \(= CA
3.4.21\), meant only ‘combined with a following mute,’ which is very unlikely,
the present precept is superfluous, as merely specifying a case already suffi-
ciently provided for elsewhere.”
On the other hand, Whitney points out that “Pāṇini \(viii.4.22: hanter at-
pūrvasya\) looks at this matter from the opposite point of view, and teaches that
the n of han is lingualized whenever it is preceded by a.” 
As I pointed out in my note on CA \(3.4.21\), Pāṇini’s grammar does
not have a rule similar to the condition स्पर्शयुक्तस्य in CA \(3.4.21\), but that it
takes care of the same phenomenon in a different way. However, the method
used in Pāṇini’s grammar to avoid the cerebralization of n in a form like kur-
vanti cannot apply to the example vr̥traghna. Here, the n of the root cannot be
first converted to an anusvāra, and then back to n, invisible to the cerebraliza-
tion rule P.8.4.1 \(रषाभ्यां नो णः समानपदे\). Therefore, Pāṇini’s formulation of

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका473
P.8.4.22 \(हन्तेरत्पूर्वस्य\) remains significant in restricting cerebralization of n in
the root han only to those instances where the n is preceded by an a. Such in-
deed is not the case with the present CA rule. Therefore, Whitney’s criticism
of it still remains valid.
३.४.२४. क्षुभ्नादीनाम् ।
Whitney \(3.92\). O: क्षुभ्णादीनां. P adds a daṇḍa after this rule as a cor-

के॒शिनीः॑’ \(अ.वे. १२.५.४८\)।
Note: The fact that there is no attested example of the root kṣubh in
the Vulgate of the AV is taken as an indication by Surya Kanta \(APR, Intro-
duction, p. 39\) that the Vulgate is not genuinely Śaunakīya, and that such ex-
amples may have occurred in a genuinely Śaunakīya recension. I tend to agree
with Whitney that the similarity of this rule with Pāṇini \(viii.4.39: क्षुभ्नादिषु च\)
suggests that the CA is relying here upon a source which dealt primarily with
the general grammar of Sanskrit. Also see my Note on CA \(3.4.5\).

the c-series, ṭ-series, and t-series.
Note: For a further discussion of the formulation of this rule, and its
contrast with Pāṇini’s grammar, see my Note on CA \(3.4.1\). Also see the
Note below.

२१.१\)।
Note: Referring to the example reṣayainān, Whitney correctly ob-
serves: “this, however, is no example under the rule.” Later, he \(AV Transl.
Vol.II., p. 616\) observed that even though the commentary ms. reads
reṣayainān, the fact that it is “quoted as an example of a palatal or lingual or
dental mute interposed between r and n, which would imply recaya. ∀That is, it
implies the mute \(c\) rather than the sibilant \(ś\), the intervention of which was
treated in the preceding rule, iii. 93 \(= CA 3.4.26\).\#” 
It should be noted that while several mss. offer the variant reśaya, none
offers the reading recaya. The rules 3.4.25-6 provide a statement which is dif-
ferent from that of P.8.4.2 \(अट्कुप्वाङ्नुम्व्यवायेऽपि\). Pāṇini’s rule lists those
sounds whose intervention does not prevent the change of n to ṇ. On the other
hand, the CA lists those sounds whose intervention prevents this change. This

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका475
shows a certain difference in the orientation of these two texts. Also, the initial
rule in Pāṇini, i.e. P.8.4.1 \(रषाभ्यां नो णः समानपदे\) assumes that the procedure
applies only to n immediately preceded by r and ṣ. Then the next rule, P.8.4.2,
allows this procedure to situations with intervention of certain sounds. On the
other hand, the initial rule in CA seems to assume that n changes to ṇ as long
as it is somehow preceded by r and ṇ. Then the text stipulates that this change
does not take place if certain sounds intervene.
Whitney offers an excellent explanation of why the intervention of
these sounds prevents cerebralization of the following n: “The physical expla-
nation of the effect of the sounds mentioned in these two rules to prevent the
lingualization of the nasal is obvious: they are all of them such as cause the
tongue to change its position. When this organ is once bent back in the mouth
to the position in which the lingual sibilant, semivowel, and vowels are uttered,
it tends to remain there, and produce the next following nasal at that point, in-
stead of at the point of dental utterance; and it does so, unless thrown out of
adjustment, as it were, by the occurrence of a letter which calls it into action in
another quarter.”

\(unless he makes the exception by some other rule which I have not observed\)
he would read paryānaddha.”

We should note that the VVRI edition provides the reading paryāṇad-

Note: The comment अनधिकारे सूत्रनिर्देशः । सूत्रार्थस्तद्योगश्च चर्चापरिहार-
योर्वचनं मा भूदिति indicates that the commentator has indeed thought about the
organization of the rules in the CA. Whitney renders the first part of this
comment as: “in the absence of an explanatory heading.” A better rendering
would be, “the rule is enunciated in an inappropriate section.” The reason for
the deviation is then given in the following comment. Whitney, however,
makes a significant observation: “The same word is found more than once in
the Rig-Veda, but is written by the pada-text tuviḥ-tama, so that there is
nothing irregular in the saṃhitā form, and it requires and receives no notice
from the Rik Prātiśākhya. It is a legitimate matter for surprise to find the rule
thrust in this place, in connection with a subject to which it stands in no relation
whatever: we should expect to meet it in the second chapter, along with rules
25 and 26 of that chapter, or after rule 30, or elsewhere. Its intrusion here, and
the indefiniteness of its form, cannot but suggest the suspicion of its being an
interpolation, made for the purpose of supplying an observed deficiency in the
treatise.” However, it must be a very early interpolation, since it is found in all
the manuscripts, and also since the commentary CAB comments upon this rule,
even though it is evidently unhappy with its location.

Note: Note the different numbers of the rules in this Adhyāya given
in the colophons for H and I. This suggests that there is a difference of opin-
ion regarding 20 statements, which are regarded as part of the Sūtra-text by
some manuscripts, while they are not considered to be part of the Sūtra-text by
others. Especially, the manuscript of the CAB, H, shows the smaller number.
Thus, it is clear that while this mss. contains all these extra-passages, without
any commentary upon them, they are not counted as being part of the Sūtra-
text. Whether they were part of the commentary, and therefore were not com-
mented upon again, or whether they were included under the influence of the
other text-tradition seen in the rest of the manuscripts is not clear.

Whitney \(p. 261\) quotes this as part of the commentary. C: no such
verse. A, B, D, J, K: °विग्रहां°. P\(orig\): °समासावग्रहां पदे° corrected to
°समासावग्रहविग्रहां पदे°. Whitney: °तथा वक्ष्यामि°. A, B, D: °पसर्ग्र°. The verses
which are given hear as CA 4.1.1-23 either formed part of the commentary, or
were a very early interpolation into the text. In any case, they are found in all
Sūtra-only manuscripts and were accepted as being part of the text of the CA.
The only manuscript which does not contain these verses \(CA 4.1.1-23\) is C.
Whether it represents an older tradition of the Sūtra-text, going to a time before
these verses were incorporated, or whether it simply left them out, is difficult to
say. It does not provide a count of the rules either for this Pāda or the
Adhyāya, and, therefore, we do not know what to make of this omission. To
confuse the matter further, the mss. C does include other passages in the 3rd
Pāda of the 3rd Adhyāya which are left out by Whitney as belonging to the
commentary. Thus, most probably, this represents an eclectic decision on the
part of someone to leave out these verses.
Translation: As Śākaṭāyana has explained for the Veda, the
compounding, the disjoining of the compounded expressions,
and the separation of words in the Padapāṭha, so will I explain
the fourfold word - noun, verb, pre-verb, and particle.
Note: As for the structure of this passage, Whitney \(1862: 184, fn\)
says: “With the slight alteration of yatho’vāca to yathā”ha, we should have here
three equal successive pādas of a metrical verse: but the impossibility of forc-
ing the last compound into any such metrical form, as a fourth pāda, renders it
very doubtful whether this is anything more than a curious coincidence, and
whether the words are not meant for simpler prose.” With all the mss. variants

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका479
at hand, it is still not possible to restore the correct metrical form of this pas-
sage, if indeed it had any originally.
४.१.२. आख्यातं यत्क्रियावाचि नाम सत्त्वाख्यमुच्यते ।
निपाताश्चादयोऽसत्त्व उपसर्गास्तु प्रादयः ॥
Whitney \(p. 261\) quotes this as part of the commentary. C: no such
verse.
Translation: The word which expresses action is the verb.
The word which names an object is said to be a noun. Words
like ca, when they do not refer to an object, are particles. How-
ever, words like pra are pre-verbs.
Note: The verse represents a mixture of the doctrines which are
found in diverse texts like Pāṇini’s grammar, Yāska’s NR, and other Prāti-
śākhyas. The definitions of verb and noun given here are more in line with
those given by the NR \(p. 23\): भावप्रधानमाख्यातम्, सत्त्वप्रधानानि नामानि. Also see
RPR \(12.17-19\): तन्नाम येनाभिदधाति सत्त्वम्, तदाख्यातं येन भावं सधातु. Patañjali’s
MB \(MLBD edn., Vol.II., p. 625\) uses kriyā instead of bhāva :
क्रियाप्रधानमाख्यातं भवति । द्रव्यप्रधानं नाम. Pāṇini, on the other hand, offers non-
semantic formal definitions for the categories of noun and verb, cf. P.1.2.45
\(अर्थवदधातुरप्रत्ययः प्रातिपदिकम्\), P.1.2.46 \(कृत्तद्धितसमासाश्च\), P.1.3.1 \(भूवादयो
धातवः\). For a detailed discussion of the differences between these definitions,
see: Deshpande \(1992: 10-15\). The definition of nipāta reminds us of
P.1.4.57 \(चादयोऽसत्त्वे\), and the definition of upasarga by referring to a list be-
ginning with pra reminds us of P.1.4.58 \(प्रादयः\) and P.1.4.59 \(उपसर्गाः
क्रियायोगे\). However, we must keep in mind that the categories of nipāta and
upasarga are not exclusive categories for Pāṇini, and both of these are ulti-
mately subsumed for him in the category of prātipadika ‘nominal stem.’ For
details, see the Note on CA \(1.3.18\). The fourfold division, on the whole, rep-
resents a non-Pāṇinian tradition, though it is referred to and utilized by the
post-Pāṇinian grammarians commenting on Pāṇini, cf. Deshpande \(1992:
13ff\).
४.१.३.नाम नाम्नानुदात्तेन समस्तं प्रकृतिस्वरम् ।

अध्याय ४, पाद १

Whitney \(p. 261\): °नाम्नानुदात्तेन° quoted as part of the commentary. A,
B: Daṇḍa after °मुदात्ते. C: no such verse. Most mss. read: नाम्नामुदात्तेन. How-
ever, I agree with Whitney’s emendation to °नाम्नानुदात्तेन°, though Whitney does
not call it an emendation. His ms. actually reads नाम्नामुदात्तेन.
Translation: A noun, brought together with an unaccented
noun, retains its natural accent. However, not desired \[in this
context\] are \(enclitic\) forms of yuṣmad or asmad, or a vocative.
Note: Whitney \(1862: 263\) interprets the first half of the verse to
mean: “a noun which has its natural accent is compounded with another which
is unaccented.” As examples of the first part of this verse, Whitney says: “thus
we must combine tri : saptā́ḥ \(i.1.1\), śatá : vr̥ṣṇyam \(i.3.1\), into tri-ṣaptā́ḥ, śatá-
vr̥ṣṇyam.”
I have a slightly different understanding of the term samastam. In my
opinion, the term does not refer to compounding as it is understood in a limited
sense in the Pāṇinian grammar, but it probably is equivalent to the wider post-
Pāṇinian conception of vr̥tti as found in Kātyāyana, Patañjali, and the later
grammarians like Bhartr̥hari. It becomes inclusive of the traditional notion of
compounding \(samāsa\), but additionally includes processes like the addition of
the taddhita and kr̥t affixes, and the formation of secondary verbs. In some of
these cases, the Padapāṭha does not completely isolate the items, but separates
their members with an avagraha. For a discussion of this conception of vr̥tti, in
the context of Padapāṭha, see K.V. Abhyankar \(1974: 5ff\). 
Thus, we can point to áṅge aṅge \(AV 1.12.2\) as a positive example of
this rule. Here, the Padapāṭha treats these two as members of a compound-
expression and separates them only with an avagraha: áṅge-aṅge. On the other
hand, consider the following counter-examples. In vásoṣpate \(AV 1.1.2\), the
unaccented pate is a vocative, and the Padapāṭha does not treat this as a com-
pound word: vásoḥ / pate /. Similarly, the unaccented enclitic forms of asmad
and yuṣmad, such as te and naḥ, are not treated by the Padapāṭha as forming a
compound-expression with the preceding accented noun: ténā te \(AV 1.3.3\) :
Pada - téna / te; tā́ naḥ \(AV 1.4.2\) : Pada - tā́ḥ / naḥ. 
४.१.४. नामानुदात्तं प्रकृतिस्वरो गतिरनुच्चो वा नाम
चेत्स्यादुदात्तम् ।
Whitney \(p. 261\) quotes this as part of the commentary. A, B:
°वेश्या° for °चेत्स्या°. C: no such rule. 

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका481
Translation: An unaccented noun and a naturally accented
particle \[= gati, are treated in the Padapāṭha as a compound-
expression\]. Or, if the noun is accented, then with an unac-
cented particle, \[it is treated as a compound-expression in the
Padapāṭha\].
Note: The term gati is repeatedly used by these rules without strictly
defining it. It is defined by P.1.4.60-79 as applying to a whole host of prepo-
sitions and particles, and particle-like items, compare the expression upasarga-
vr̥tti ‘items which behave like an upasarga’ in CA \(4.1.22\). 
We may offer the following examples to illustrate the teachings of this
rule. In úpahūtaḥ \(AV 1.1.4\), the accented particle úpa is compounded with
the unaccented hūtaḥ, cf. Padapāṭha : úpa-hūtaḥ. On this expression, the com-
mentary of \[Pseudo-\]Sāyaṇa says: ‘गतिरनन्तर’ \(पा.६.२.४९\) इति गतेः प्रकृतिस्वर-
त्वम् । ‘उपसर्गाश्चाभिवर्जम्’ \(फिट्सूत्र ४.१३\) इत्युपशब्द आद्युदात्तः. In niṣécanam \(AV
1.3.1\), the unaccented ni is compounded with the accented word sécanam, cf.
Padapāṭha : ni-sécanam. In this example, by P.6.2.139 \(गतिकारकोपपदात् कृत्\),
the word sécana is allowed to retain its derivational accent, and the particle ní
loses its original accent and becomes unaccented. While Pāṇini’s grammar, as
part of its derivational process, teaches us how an item which is ‘originally’
\(prakr̥tisvara = lexical accent\) accented can lose its accent in the process of
being combined with other words in compounding etc., the Prātiśākhya simply
looks at the result that the particle ni in the example cited above is unaccented.
While the Prātiśākhya does not clearly specify the circumstances under which a
particle may lose its accent, it does have the conception of its original or lexical
accent.
४.१.५. क्रियायोगे गतिः पूर्वः समासो यावन्तोऽनुच्चाः 
समर्थास्तान्समस्येत् ।
Whitney \(p. 261\) quotes this as part of the commentary. Whitney, H:
°समर्थांस्तान्°. Whitney, H, J: °समस्यते. E, F, I: Daṇḍa after क्रियायोगे. A, B:
°समासोर्या°, °स्तात्समस्येत्. C: no such rule. O: °गतिपूर्वः°.
Translation: A preceding \[unaccented\] particle \(gati\) is com-
pounded with a verb. As many semantically related unaccented
particles there may be, they should all be compounded \[with the
following verb\].

अध्याय ४, पाद १
482
Note: The verse here deals with the compounding of the pre-verbs
with finite verbs. Thus, a proper example may be pariyánti \(AV 1.1.1\), where
an unaccented pari is compounded with an accented verb: Padapāṭha : pari-
yánti, with an avagraha indicating that this is a compound-expression. On this
expression, the commentary of \[Pseudo\]-Sāyaṇa says: उदात्तवता तिङा गतेः
समासवचनमिति परिशब्दस्य तिङन्तेन समासः । ‘तिङि चोदात्तवति’ \(पा.८.१.७१\) इति
गतेरनुदात्तत्वम्. An accented pre-verb is not compounded with the following
unaccented verb.
The second part of the verse lays down a rule which, as far as I under-
stand, is repeated in part in CA \(4.1.6\) and CA \(4.1.24: अनेकोऽनुदात्तेनापि\). The
CAB on CA \(4.1.24\) offers a number of examples, where several unaccented
pre-verbs, followed by an accented pre-verb, are all compounded with the fol-
lowing verb form:
चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - अनेक उपसर्गः अनुदात्तेनापि आख्यातेन सह समस्यते।
‘उ॒त्ऽअव॑स्यति’ \(पद, अ.वे. ९.६.५४, VVRI edn.: ९.११.६\)। ‘स॒म्ऽ-
आचि॑नुष्व । अ॒नु॒ऽस॒म्प्रया॑हि’ \(पद, अ.वे. ११.१.३६\)। ‘उ॒प॒ऽस॒म्परा॑न\(H:
ण\)यात्’ \(पद, अ.वे. १८.४.५०\)। उपसर्गवृत्तिभिश्च । ‘अ॒च्छ॒ऽआव॑दामसि’
\(पद, अ.वे. ७.३८.३, VVRI edn.: ७.३९.३\)। ‘अ॒भि॒ऽहिङ्कृ॑णोत’ \(पद,
अ.वे. १२.३.३७\)।
The present rule, as well as CA \(4.1.24\), seem to also allow a host of
unaccented pre-verbs to be compounded with an accented verb. However, all
the instances in the CAB on CA \(4.1.24\) are of unaccented verb preceded by
an accented pre-verb, preceded by one or more unaccented pre-verbs. We need
to find instances in the AV of an accented verb compounded with a plurality of
unaccented pre-verbs. A.A. Macdonell \(1916: 469\) offers an instance of this
type: pariprayāthá \(RV 4.51.5\), RV-Padapāṭha : pari-prayāthá. It seems that
such an instance is difficult to find in the AV, in view of the APR rule \(12c, p.
11\), which says that when an accented verb is preceded by two upasargas, the
first of them is isolated as a separate word. All the instances offered under this
rule have the first upasarga, treated here as a karmapravacanīya and is accented,
e.g. abhí vipáśyāmi \(AV 12.1.33\).
४.१.६.यत्रानेकोऽनुदात्तोऽस्ति परश्च प्रकृतिस्वरः ।
आख्यातं नाम वा यत्स्यात्सर्वमेव समस्यते ॥
Whitney \(p. 261\) quotes this as part of the commentary. A, B, D, M:
°प्रकृतिः स्वरः°. E, F, I, O: यत्रानेकोप्यनुच्चोस्ति°. C: no such verse.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका483
Translation: Where there is more than one unaccented
\[particle/preverb = gati\], and where the following \[word?
particle/preverb = gati ?\] retains its original accent \[i.e. remains
udātta\], the following verb or noun is compounded with all
these.
Note: Examples of unaccented verbs, compounded with the preced-
ing accented upasarga, preceded further by one or more unaccented upasargas,
are found in the CAB on CA 4.1.24: अ॒नु॒ऽस॒म्प्रया॑हि’ \(पद, अ.वे. ११.१.३६\)।
‘उ॒प॒ऽस॒म्परा॑नयात्’ \(पद, अ.वे. १८.४.५०\)। 
As I have indicated by the question-mark in my translation, the phrase
paraś ca prakr̥tisvaraḥ could perhaps mean ‘where the following word retains
its original accent,’ and this may be taken to refer to the following verb or noun
maintaining its original accent. In my Note on the previous rule, I have men-
tioned that the APR rule \(12c, p. 11\) seems to be against the possibility of an
accented verb being compounded with more than one unaccented pre-verb.
However, we do find examples of a plurality of unaccented pre-verbs com-
pounded with a verbal noun, if we include a gerund among verbal nouns:
abhyudétya \(AV 15.11.2\), Padapāṭha : abhi-udétya. This is a combination of
abhi\+ud\+ā with the gerund form ítya, which retains its accent in the com-
pound-expression.
४.१.७.सोपसर्गं तु यन्नीचैः पूर्वं वा यदि वा परम् ।
उदात्तेन समस्यन्ते तथैव सुप्रतिष्ठितम् ॥
Whitney \(p. 261\) quotes this as part of the commentary. H, J, M, P:
°यदि वा परः°. D, E, F, I, O, P: °यथैतत्सुप्रतिष्ठितं. I: °समस्येते°. C: no such verse.
D omits उदात्तेन समस्यन्ते.
Translation: An unaccented word, accompanied by a pre-
verb, is compounded with an \[another?\] accented \[preverb\],
\[irrespective of?\] whether \[the accented preverb\] is the first one
or the second one. Thus is the example súpratiṣṭhitam. 
Note: This is verse 5 in Whitney’s \(1862: 263\) text, and he says:
“Verse five has for its subject such compounds as are instanced by
súpratiṣṭhitam \(xii.1.63 : p. sú-pratiṣṭhitam.” Here, prati\+ṣṭhitam is unaccented
and is compounded further with the accented preverb sú. As an instance illus-
trating the second upasarga being the accented one, we can cite upā́kr̥tam \(AV

अध्याय ४, पाद १
484
2.34.2\), Padapāṭha : upa-ā́kr̥tam. Here, the basic word, kr̥tam is unaccented.
However, of the two upasargas, it is the second one which is the accented
upasarga, in contrast with the example súpratiṣṭhitam.
४.१.८.उदात्तस्तु निपातो यः सोऽनुदात्तः क्वचिद्भवेत् ।
समस्यन्ते तथाविधमितिहासो निदर्शनम् ॥
Whitney \(p. 261\) quotes this as part of the commentary. H, I: °विधिः
मिति°. D, O: °समस्यते°. E, F, O: °यथाविधमिति°. Others: °तथाविधिमिति°. C: no
such verse. O: °सानुदात्तः°.
Translation: A particle which is \[normally\] accented can oc-
casionally become unaccented, and as such is compounded. An
instance of that kind is itihāsáḥ.
Note: The word itihāsáḥ \(AV 15.6.4\) is analyzed by the Padapāṭha as
itiha-āsáḥ. The lexical accent of iti is íti, and the ha is lexically unaccented.
However, the item íti loses its accent in the process of compounding.
४.१.९.नघारिषां सुसहेत्येवमादीन्युदाहरेत् ।
सहेत्यनेनानुदात्तं परं नाम समस्यते ॥
Whitney \(p. 261\) quotes this as part of the commentary. Whitney:
°सुसहे°. B, D: °सहसहे°. C: no such verse. O: °सहेत्येनानुदात्तं°. P: नघरिषां°. All
other mss. read ससहे°, and Whitney reads °सुसहे°, though his manuscript actu-
ally reads ससहे°. In any case, in spite of the fact that no manuscript directly
supports it, I believe that Whitney’s emendation offers the correct original
reading, and I have adopted it in the text of the verse. Also see the Note below.
Translation: \[Additionally, for the preceding rule\], one
should offer examples such as naghāriṣā́m and súsaha. \[The
next rule:\] An unaccented noun is compounded with the pre-
ceding sahá. \[Examples in the next verse ab.\]
Note: The form naghāriṣām occurs in AV \(7.7.6\). Whitney \(AV
Transl. Vol.II., 499\) remarks: “The mss. again are much at variance as to the
reading of naghāriṣā́m, Bp.I.M.p.m.E.p.m.O. read \!Bp. with -ghă-∀ naghā-
r̥ṣā́m. \!Ppp. reads naghāriṣām \(as does Berlin ed.\).∀” 

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका485
The reading found in most mss., i.e. sasahe° makes no sense in this
context, and probably represents the confusion of susaha and sasahe, enhanced
by the presence in the AV of the form sasahe \(AV 1.16.3; 2.5.3\). However,
this is a verb form with reduplication, and does not illustrate anything in the
present context. 
The examples naghāriṣā́m \(AV 8.2.6, 7.6\) and súsaha \(AV 6.64.3\) are
intended to illustrate the rule given in the previous verse. Normally, ná is an
accented particle, but it loses its accent in the first example. Similarly, sahá is
normally accented on the last syllable. However, it loses its accent in the
compound-expression súsaha.
४.१.१० अनुदात्तेन चोदात्तं सभावो यत्र चोच्यते ।
सहसूक्तवाकः सान्तर्देशाः शतक्रतो \[सकृतौ?\] निदर्शनम् ॥
Whitney \(p. 261\) quotes this as part of the commentary. E, F, I, O:
°चोदात्तमभावो°. C: no such verse. O: °सातदेशाः°. Other mss. read स्वभावो. The
reading सभावो is my emendation. See the Note below.
Translation: \[Continuing the previous topic of compounding
of sahá\]: And, where the change \[of sahá\] to sa is taught, an
accented word is compounded with the unaccented \[sa\]. The
illustrations are sahásūktavākaḥ, sā́ntardeśāḥ, and śatakrato.
Note: I have translated the first part of the verse, assuming the emen-
dation sabhāvo referring to the change of sahá to sa. In my opinion, the manu-
script readings codāttaṃ svabhāvo and codāttam abhāvo are corruptions for
codāttaṃ sabhāvo, because the copyists could not understand the word
sabhāvo, and replaced it with the more familiar words, which actually make no
sense in the context.
The examples sahásūktavākaḥ \(AV 7.97.6\) and sā́ntardeśāḥ \(AV 9.5.
37\) illustrate the two types of combinations. In the first combination, the
accented word sahá is combined with the unaccented sūktavākaḥ. In the sec-
ond combination, the unaccented sa is combined with the accented ántardeśāḥ,
cf. Padapāṭha : sa-ántardeśāḥ. As for the example śatakrato \(AV 14.1.41\),
Whitney \(1862: 263\) comments: “śatakrato is also added, but apparently only
by a blunder; or rather, the reading is probably false and corrupt, as the metre
helps to show.” All the manuscripts have this reading, and yet the reading
makes no sense in this context. I would like to suggest that śatakrato is an an-
cient error of a copyist for sakŕ̥tau \(AV 11.1.10\) which is analyzed by the

अध्याय ४, पाद १
486
Padapāṭha as sa-kŕ̥tau, a compound of an accented word with the unaccented sa
for sahá. This copyist’s error must be truly ancient to get into all the available
manuscripts. This may indicate that ultimately all our existing manuscripts go
back to a common source which had this error.
४.१.११.अनुदात्तो गतिर्मध्ये पूर्वपरौ प्रकृतिस्वरौ ।
पूर्वेण विग्रहस्तत्र पुरुषेऽधि समाहिते ॥
Whitney \(p. 262\) quotes this as part of the commentary. A, B, D, P:
अनुदात्तानुगति°. Other mss. read: अनुदात्तोऽनुगतिर्मध्ये. Whitney’s emendation: अनु-
दात्तो गतिर्मध्ये°, °समाहितः. C, E, F, I, O: in a different location. J: no such verse.
I have adopted Whitney’s emendation over the manuscripts. The reading अनु-
दात्तोऽनुगतिः probably developed due to the scribal confusion with उदात्तोनुगतिः in
the next verse. The prevalence of this confusion in most manuscripts also hints
at its presence in the archetype from which probably all our surviving
manuscripts are derived. For a similar phenomenon, see my Note on the
preceding verse.
Translation: Where there is an unaccented pre-verb \[= gati\]
in between the preceding and the following \[pre-verbs\], both of
which have their natural accent \[udātta\], the first of these is iso-
lated \[in the Padapāṭha as a separate word\], for example: púruṣé
’dhi samā́hite \(AV 10.7.15\).
Note: In the example cited by the verse, there are three pre-verbs
\[gati, upasarga\], such that the first and the third are udātta, while the second
one is unaccented, i.e. ádhi\+sam\+ā́. The verse says that in such a sequence, the
first preverb is isolated in the Padapāṭha as an independent word, namely that it
is not treated as part of a compound. This is confirmed by the Padapāṭha.
Here, one may say that ádhi is syntactically related to púruṣe, rather than with
samā́hite, and, hence, to use the Pāṇinian terminology, it is a true preposition
\(karmapravacanīya\), rather than a preverb \(upasarga\). Both categories are sub-
sumed under the wider category of gati in the Pāṇinian grammar, as is appar-
ently the case with these verses. The phrase púruṣé ’dhi samā́hitāḥ appears in
the same verse. The grammatical theory as expressed in the verse pays atten-
tion only to the sequence of accented or unaccented items, but does not seem to
pay much attention to the syntactic component.

४.१.१२.उदात्तोऽनुगतिर्यत्रानुदात्तं परं पदम् ।
पूर्वेण विग्रहस्तत्र संसुभूत्या निदर्शनम् ॥
Whitney \(p. 262\) quotes this as part of the commentary. B, D, M:
उदात्तौ नु गतिर्यत्रा°. E, F, J: अनुदात्तोनुगतिर्यत्रा°. C: no such verse. O, P: उदात्तो-
नुगति°. Others: उदात्तानुगति. The meter requires a hiatus: यत्र अनुदात्तं.
Translation: Where an accented \[pre-verb, particle, gati\] is
followed by a pre-verb, and where the following word is unac-
cented, in such a case, the first \[pre-verb, particle, gati\] is iso-
lated \[in the Padapāṭha as a separate word\], for example: sáṃ
súbhūtyā \(AV 3.14.1\).
Note: Whitney \(1862: 263\) describes this verse as: “where two ac-
cented prepositions precede an unaccented noun, the former of them is to be
made independent.” The Padapāṭha for the example reads: sám / sú-bhūtyā /.
The verse does not clearly say that both the pre-verbs must be accented. How-
ever, given that the noun is said to be unaccented, this makes the compounded
pre-verb an accented item. 
We should note that, the logic of this verse is not entirely clear. The
actual practice of the AV Padapāṭha, which is also corroborated by 54 exam-
ples listed under APR \(10, pp. 9-11\), seems to provide a somewhat generalized
rule. When an accented or unaccented verbal noun \(kr̥danta\) is preceded by
two upasargas, with the first one being an accented upasarga / karmaprava-
canīya, it is isolated as a separate word in the Padapāṭha. For instance, ápa dur-
matím \(AV 14.2.6\). Here, dur is unaccented, matím is accented, and yet the
Padapāṭha isolates ápa as an independent word. There are a large number of
examples of this kind. 
४.१.१३.यत्रोभे प्रकृतिस्वरे पूर्वं यच्च परं च यत् ।
वर्जयित्वाद्युदात्तानि सर्वमेव विगृह्यते ॥
Whitney \(p. 262\) quotes this as part of the commentary. E, F, O: यत्रो-
भेदप्रकृतिस्वरे°. Whitney: °पूर्वे°. F, M: °त्वाद्युत्तादानि°. E, F, I, O: °सर्वमेव विगृह्यते.
Others: सर्वमेव समस्यते. C: no such verse.
Translation: Where both the first and the second \[upasargas\]
are naturally accented \(udātta\), in such cases, after isolating the

अध्याय ४, पाद १
488
initial accented items \[as independent words in the Padapāṭha\],
all the items are separated.
Note: On this verse, Whitney \(1862: 263\) remarks: “Verse 11 has no
example, and, although easily enough translated, its meaning is to me obscure.” 
To begin to make sense of this verse, we need to properly interpret the
term ādyudātta. 
On the one hand, the term ādyudātta understood as ‘an item with its
initial syllable with the udātta accent,’ distinguishes between accented and
unaccented preverbs, and then distinguishes between those which are accented
on the first syllable, and the ones which are accented on the last syllable. Such
a distinction is possible only with polysyllabic upasargas. CA \(4.1.19-21\)
below tell us that all the twenty upasargas are naturally accented. Out of the
eleven polysyllabic upasargas, abhí is the only one which is accented on the
final syllable. All the others are accented on the first syllable. If the verse
above, as translated here, is to be meaningful, it refers to a difference of
behavior between abhí and the rest of the upasargas. I have not been able to
detect any clear behavioral difference.
Therefore, I have chosen to interpret the term ādyudāttāni in the verse to
refer to ‘initial accented items.’ If this meaning is accepted, then we can find
examples to illustrate this verse. As far as I can see, all the 57 examples listed
under APR \(13c, pp. 12-14\) would fall into this category. Here, typically, an
unaccented verb is preceded by two accented upasargas, and the Padapāṭha
isolates all of these as separate words. For example: úpa prā́gāt \(AV 1.28.1\),
Padapāṭha : úpa / prá / agāt /.
I should note here that over half the mss. read सर्वमेव समस्यते instead of
सर्वमेव विगृह्यते. I have chosen the latter reading, and I admit, along with
Whitney, that I cannot make any sense of the former.
४.१.१४.नाख्यातानि समस्यन्ते न चाख्यातं च नाम च ।
नाम नाम्नोपसर्गैस्तु संबद्धार्थं समस्यते ॥
Whitney \(p. 261\) quotes this as part of the commentary. E, F, I, O:
नामाख्यातानि समस्यंते°. A, B, D, P: °पसर्ग्रै°. C: no such verse. P: नाख्यानि सम-
स्यंते°. O: °नाम्नोपसर्गेस्तु°. H: संवधार्थं. Others: संबंधार्थं.
Translation: Verbs are not compounded \[with each other\],
nor is a verb and a noun compound \[with each other\]. How-

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका489
ever, a semantically related noun is compounded with a noun or
with a pre-verb \(upasarga\).
Note: The reading sambandhārtham, as supported by most manuscripts, and
by Whitney \(1862: 262\), would literally mean: ‘for the sake of relationship.’
However, taking a hint from the reading संवधार्थं in H, I have chosen to amend
the text to संबद्धार्थं. The word sambaddhārtha as an equivalent to samartha is
found in the MB on P.2.1.1 \(Kielhorn edn., Vol.I., p. 365\): सम्बद्धार्थः समर्थः.
Also relevant in the context is the fact that the APR \(3, p. 3\) is identical with
P.2.1.1 \(समर्थः पदविधिः\), and that the APR often brings up the notion that no
compounding takes places between items which are asamartha, cf. APR \(13b,
p. 12\). I suspect that the present verse is making a similar statement. The
statement सम्बद्धार्थं समस्यते of this verse is comparable to APR \(13b, p. 12\):
उपसर्गपूर्वमाख्यातं यत्रोभाभ्यां समस्यते ।

४.१.१५.न युष्मदस्मदादेशा अनुदात्ताः पदात्परे ।

P: °नाम्नोपसर्गगतिभिः ... कदाचनः°. 
Translation: The unaccented forms of yuṣmad and asmad
which occur after \[other words, i.e. are enclitic,\] are never com-
pounded with nouns, preverbs and prepositional items.
Note: Examples for this verse are found in the first half of the next
verse.

Translation: \[To illustrate the rule in the previous verse\], one
should offer examples such as: mā́m ánu prá te \(AV 3.18.6\)
and prá vām \(AV 7.73.5\). \[The second half of this verse goes
with the next verse, and is translated below\].
Note: The Padapāṭha isolates prá from te and vām in these examples
to indicate that they are separate words, and not members of compounds.
४.१.१७.नामोपसर्गगतिभिः समस्यन्ते कदाचन ।

Whitney \(p. 262\) quotes this as part of the commentary. C: no such
rule. P: एनं for एनां.
Translation: \[Beginning with the second half of the previous
verse\]: The unaccented forms of etad, as well as those of idam,
are never compounded with nouns, pre-verbs, and prepositional
items. The examples are: br̥hánn eṣām \(AV 4.16.1\), yá enāṃ
vaním āyánti \(AV 12.4.11\), páry enān \(AV 9.2.5\), and páry
asya \(AV 15.12.7\).
Note: It is clear that this must be a prohibitory rule. However, the text
of the verses does not contain an explicit na. We need to continue the force of
na in the previous rule into this rule, perhaps indicated by ca “also.” The
Padapāṭha clearly separates the forms eṣām, enām, enān, and asya from the
neighboring words to indicate that there is no compounding.
४.१.१८.अनुदात्तो गतिः सर्वैः समस्तः स्वरितादिभिः ।

Whitney \(p. 262\) quotes this as part of the commentary. E, F, I, O:
reads CA 4.1.11 in this place, and read this verse in another location. E, F, H,
I, M: अनुदात्तोनुगतिः सर्वैः समस्तस्वरितादिभिः°. E, F, I: °सँस्राव्येण निर्दुरर्मण्य°. E, F, H,
I, O: °आचार्येति°. Others: आचार्य इति. C: no such verse. O: °संस्राव्येण
निदुर्मण्य°. P: °संस्राव्ये दुर्मण्य°.
Translation: An unaccented prepositional item is com-
pounded with all kinds of words which have circumflex and

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका491
other accents, for example: saṃsrāvyèṇa \(AV 1.15.1\), durar-
maṇyàḥ \(AV 16.2.1\), and ācāryàḥ \(AV 11.5.3\).
Note: Given the fact that the reading svaritādibhiḥ is supported by all
mss., it can either mean ‘svarita etc.’ or ‘those which begin with a svarita sylla-
ble.’ Since the second meaning does not seem to be even remotely applicable,
we must accept the first meaning. Whitney \(1862: 263\) takes this to mean
‘however accented,’ and then says that the verse “illustrates only their compo-
sition with a circumflexed word.” All the three illustrations demonstrate the
same type, i.e. compounding of an unaccented prepositional item with the fol-
lowing word with a svarita accent. How about the compounding of an unac-
cented prepositional item with words with udātta or anudātta accents? If our
understanding of the verse is correct, this should be possible.
We can find a large number of instances where an unaccented preposi-
tional item is compounded with the following word with an udātta syllable, e.g.
sumatím \(AV 4.25.6\). However, it is not easy to find an unaccented preposi-
tional item compounded with an unaccented \(sarvānudātta\) word. The only
cases I can locate in the text of the AV are those where a previous compound
becomes completely unaccented through further embedding, e.g. r̥táprajātā \(AV
1.11.1\), where the segment prajātā becomes completely unaccented because of
its further compounding with r̥tá. Otherwise, the word would be accented as
prájātā \(AV 1.34.1\).
The AV mss. read durarmaṇya \(AV 15.2.1\). However, Whitney \(AV

maṇyàs to duradmanyàs, as proposed by the Pet. Lexx. \(add TB. iii.3.99 as a
reference for duradmanī́\). The reading of the mss. is, however, assured by its
quotation in the Prāt., and three times in the Kāuś.”

Note: For the second half of the verse, the meter requires us to read:
अत्यपिसूदपाभीति उपानुप्रति विंशतिः.
४.१.२०.एकाक्षरा उदात्ता आद्युदात्तास्तथापरे ।
अभीत्यन्त उपसर्गाः क्रियायोगे गतिस्तथा ॥
Whitney \(p. 262\) quotes this as part of the commentary. I: एकाक्षरा उदा-
त्तास्त आद्यु°. K: अभीत्यन्ता. Other mss. and Whitney: °अभीत्यन्त उप°. A, B, D:
°सर्गा क्रिया°. C: no such verse. O: एकाक्षरमुदात्ता°. 
Translation: Of these, the monosyllabic ones have the high-
pitch accent. Others have their first syllable with the high-pitch
accent, \[except for\] abhí \[which has its\] final \[syllable with the
high-pitch accent\]. In conjunction with verbs, these items are
called upasarga, as well as gati.
Note: The lone reading in I, i.e. एकाक्षरा उदात्तास्त आद्यु° looks like an
effort to regularize a line which is otherwise metrically deficient, and this indi-
cates that the metrically deficient reading, supported by most manuscripts, is
the earlier reading.
The expression abhītyanta\(ḥ\) must be interpreted to mean abhītyanto-
dāttaḥ. The final part of the verse उपसर्गाः क्रियायोगे गतिस्तथा calls to mind
P.1.4.59 \(उपसर्गाः क्रियायोगे\) and P.1.4.60 \(गतिश्च\).
४.१.२१.आद्युदात्ता दशैतेषामुच्चा एकाक्षरा नव ।

Whitney \(p. 262\) quotes this as part of the commentary. A, B, D, M:
°सर्ग्रा°. C: no such verse. O: °दशैतेषाउच्चा°.
Translation: Of these twenty upasargas, ten \[polysyllabic
ones\] have their initial syllable high-pitched, nine monosyllabic
ones are high-pitched, and abhí has its final syllable high-
pitched.
Note: This verse is quoted in the Prātiśākhyapradīpaśikṣā \(Śikṣāsaṃgraha, p.
267\). It is prefaced with tathā coktam, and the first and the second lines are
reversed. In the same form, this verse occurs in the RPR \(12.22-24\). Uvaṭa’s
comment on this verse runs as: प्र, आ, निः, दुः, वि, सम्, नि, सु, उत्,

passage in this entire text. 
Translation: The following items, \[though not listed as upa-
sargas\], behave like upasargas, and their accents are as recited:
áccha, áram, ástam, hásta, lāṅgūlam, tiráḥ, puráḥ, púnaḥ, nava,
śyetī́, vātī́, phalī, híṃ, srúk, váṣaṭ, ululā , kakajā́, svā́hā, svadhā́,
śrat, svàr, alalā.
Note: Whitney \(1862\) took great pains to make sense of this passage,
for which he had only one manuscript. We shall begin by noting his comments
\(1862: 263-4\): “Finally, the last verse \(or prose passage\) attempts to give a list
of those words which are treated as if they were prepositions, although prop-
erly belonging to what it includes and what it omits. A part of the forms which
it contains are in frequent use, and familiarly known as bearing marked analo-
gies with the prepositions proper. Such are achā, tiraḥ, puraḥ, punaḥ, hiṅ,
prāduḥ, and śrat. Others, as aram and astam, are more remotely connected with
the same class. Vaṣaṭ, svāhā, and vātī are in the Atharvan compounded only
with kāra and kr̥ta, and hardly in such a manner as should require their
inclusion in the list. Svadhā and sruk form no other compounds than svadhā-
kāra and srukkāra \(ix.6.22\); phalī forms phalīkaraṇa \(xi.3.6\); kakajā forms
kakajākr̥ta \(xi.10.25\). Namas enters into namaskāra, namaskr̥ta, and namas-
kr̥tya \(vii.102.1\), which last affords actually good ground for special treatment,
as does hastagr̥hya \(e.g. v.14.4\), on account of which hasta is ranked with the

अध्याय ४, पाद १
494
others. For lāṅgūla, kṣitī, and ulā, I can find nothing at all in the Atharvan :
there is room in the case of the two last, and especially of the third, to suspect
corrupted readings. What may be hidden in svaralalā, I have not been able to
discover, nor how the last word in the extract, which apparently has to do with
the accent of the words treated of, is to be amended into intelligibility.”
With the new set of manuscripts at our disposal, and with further
thought on the listed items, I think it is now possible to advance beyond
Whitney’s difficulties. We shall look at the listed items individually:
1. Áccha. For example: ácchā vada \(AV 3.20.2\). Compare P.1.4.69
\(अच्छ गत्यर्थवदेषु\), which treats áccha as a gati.
2. Áram \(= álam\). For example: áraṅkr̥tam \(AV 12.1.22\). Compare
P.1.4.64 \(भूषणेऽलम्\), which treats álam as a gati.
3. Ástam. For example: astameṣyaté \(AV 17.1.23\). Compare P.1.4.68
\(अस्तं च\), which treats ástam as a gati.
4. Hásta. For example: hastagŕ̥hya \(AV 5.14.4\). Compare P.1.4.77
\(नित्यं हस्ते पाणावुपयमने\), which treats haste as a gati. The mss. reading hasto is
probably a corruption of haste, as it is found in P.1.4.77.
5. Lāṅgūlam. The word lāṅgūla is attested in the Paippalāda AV
\(9.8.1\) in the expression lāṅgūla-gr̥hya, which is directly comparable with
hasta-gŕ̥hya \(AV 5.14.4\). Such an occurrence accounts for its being listed as
an upasarga-vr̥tti item. In my view, this is the best explanation. However, I
would like to mention two further possibilities.
A possible reading is uluṅgulam. All manuscripts have the reading
hastolāṅgūlaṃ, which Whitney amended to hastalāṅgūlam. This did not ac-
count for the o in hasto. My guess is that hastoluṅgulaṃ could be analyzed as
hasta\+uluṅgulaṃ. Here, the word uluṅgulam is in all probability a portion of
the name of the Apsaras mentioned in Paippalāda AV \(15.19.1-12: इदमुलुङ्-
गुलुकाभ्योऽप्सराभ्योऽकरं नमः\). With the final agentive affix -uka, the formation
uluṅgulukā looks like a derivation from a denominative verb uluṅgulati, from
the sound-imitation uluṅgula-. Such sound-imitations, especially in com-
bination with verbs like kr̥ are called gati, cf. ulalā and alalā below. The word
uluṅgulukā has been provided with a somewhat unclear folk-etymology in
Paippalāda AV \(15.18.6: उलमालस्य यो गुलस्तदगश्छन्त्यासुरैः\). 
I would also like to mention one more possibility. A reading such as
hastolūgaluṃ may contain three words: hasta, ulū, and galuṃ. Here, the word
ulū could be the first member of the word ulū́khala \(AV 9.6.15\) which is left
unanalyzed by the Padapāṭha. The next item galuṃ may be the first portion of
the expression galuntáḥ \(AV 6.83.3\). This expression is not split by the

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका495
Padapāṭha. However, Sāyaṇa explains this expression as: गडून् तस्यति इति
गडुन्तः । तसु उपक्षये । अस्मात् औणादिकः क्विप्. Thus, if the word is traditionally
derived from galu\+tas, the ṃ could be explained on the analogy of forms like
aruntuda, cf. P.6.3.67 \(अरुर्द्विषदजन्तस्य मुम्\). It is possible that Śākaṭāyana listed
the form galuṃ as an upasargavr̥tti item. 
6. Tiráḥ. For example: tiráskaraḥ \(AV 4.20.7\). Compare P.1.4.71
\(तिरोऽन्तर्द्धौ\), which treats tiráḥ as a gati.
7. Puráḥ. For example: puraḥsaraú \(AV 15.2.1-4\). Compare P.1.4.67
\(पुरोऽव्ययम्\), which treats puráḥ as a gati.
8. Púnar. For example: punardā́ya \(AV 5.17.11\). On P.1.4.60
\(गतिश्च\), Kātyāyana’s Vārttika \(पुनश्चनसौ छन्दसि\) adds púnar as a gati.
9. Náva. There is a strong possibility that náva, in the sense of ‘newly,
recently,’ may have been treated as a gati in an instance like navagát \(AV
3.10.4\), which is split by the Padapāṭha as nava-gát. Also see: Wackernagel,
Altindische Grammatik, Vol. II., Pt. I., Nachträge zu Band II1, von Albert
Debrunner, p. 21: “nava- im Sinn von \*návam ‘neulich’ \(vgl. gr.
\#∃%&∍∃\#\(\) usw. zu \#∃%\#\) z.B. v. nava-sū́- ‘eine Kuh, die kÜrzlich gekalbt hat’
Schwyzer Mél. Boisacq 2, 236.” All the manuscripts read punarṇavaḥ. It is
easy to see how the combination in the list of punar\+nava may have been
identified by the copyists with the AV word punarṇavaḥ \(AV 8.1.20\).
Against his manuscript, and now against all manuscripts, Whitney
amended the text to read punarṇamaḥ. Námas is attested in AV. For example:
namaskāréṇa \(AV 4.39.9\). The word namaḥ is included in the sākṣātprabhr̥tīni
list of items treat as gati in combination with the root kr̥, cf. P.1.4.74
\(साक्षात्प्रभृतीनि च\), and the KV on this rule. However, given the above explana-
tion in favor of náva, we need not go for Whitney’s emendation.
10. Śyetī́. This reading is supported by mss. E, F, I, and O, and
probably is the source of the reading kṣitī in H. The item syetī as a cvi-form
appears in combination with the verb kr̥ in the Taittirīya-Saṃhitā \(5.5.8:
śyaiténa śyetī́ akuruta ... śyaiténa śyetī́ kurute\). This form, along with mithunī,
is mentioned in TPR \(x.18: न श्येती मिथुनी\). While the AV does not have the
usage of śyetī́\+kr̥, the word śyaita is attested in AV \(15.2.4\). The similarity of
the formations śyetī́\+kr̥ with vātī\+kr̥ below is inescapable.
I would like to mention sani as another possibility, though not a very
strong one. In the form saniṣyadā́ḥ \(AV 19.2.1\), the portion sani is actually
part of reduplication of the root in the intensive form. However, several manu-
scripts of the Padapāṭha place an avagraha between sani and syadā́ḥ, suggest-
ing that somebody at sometime may have looked at sani as a first member of a
compound-expression, cf. Whitney, Index Verborum to AV, p. 304, and the

अध्याय ४, पाद १
496
VVRI edition, Part IV, Fasc. I., p. 1790. Whitney \(AV Translation, Vol. II.,
p. 899\) says: “Our saniṣyadā́s in c is an emendation, and called for \!see Skt.
Gram. § 1148. 4. k., near the end∀; all the mss., and SPP., accent saniṣyádās.
... The pada-mss. make the absurd division sani°syádāḥ.” While Whitney’s
view may be historically correct, there is no reason to reject out of hand the
strong possibility that some traditions analyzed the word differently. This is
especially so in view of the different accentuation for the word found in the
manuscripts. The combination sani-vātī in the list was easily misunderstood
and changed to sinīvālī by some copyists.
11. Vātī́. For example: vātī́kr̥tasya \(AV 6.109.3\). Such forms are in-
cluded under P.1.4.61 \(ऊर्यादिच्विडाचश्च\).
12. Phalī. For example: phalīkáraṇāḥ \(AV 11.3.6\). The item phalī-
kr̥tya is listed by the KV under P.1.4.61 \(ऊर्यादिच्विडाचश्च\).
13. Híṃ. For example: hiṅkāráḥ \(AV 11.7.5\). Compare the items
hum, ghum etc. which are listed among nipātas under P.1.4.57 \(चादयोऽसत्त्वे\), cf.
the KV on P.1.4.57. As imitations of sounds, these are covered as gatis under
P.1.4.62 \(अनुकरणं चानितिपरम्\).
14. Srúk. For example: srukkāréṇa \(AV 9.6.22\). This expression ap-
pears in the same verse which has the more familiar expression vaṣaṭkāréṇa,
and the items listed next in our list is váṣaṭ.
15. Váṣaṭ. For example: vaṣaṭkāréṇa \(AV 9.6.22\). The item váṣaṭ is
listed as a gati in the ūryādigaṇa in P.1.4.61 \(ऊर्यादिच्विडाचश्च\), cf. the KV on
P.1.4.61.
16. Ululā . This is my suggested emendation. The mss. readings vary:
uḍulā, gudurulā, ulā. The form ululā is made likely by the fact that AV \(3.19.6\)
has the expression ghóṣā ululáyaḥ. Sāyaṇa’s commentary has the reading
ullulayáḥ, which he explains as अनुकरणशब्दोऽयम् । उल्लुलु इत्येवमात्मका घोषाः. If
ululu or ullulu is a sound-imitation, then to combine it with a verb like kr̥ in the
sense of making that sound, P.1.4.62 \(अनुकरणं चानितिपरम्\), the sound-imitation
is given the designation gati. Also P.5.4.57 \(अव्यक्तानुकरणाद् द्व्यजवरार्धादनितौ
डाच्\) prescribes the affix ḍāc to be added to a sound-imitation like ululu to turn
it into ululā before it is compounded with a verb like karoti. In fact, the
expressions ululākuru and ululākr̥taḥ are attested in Paippalāda AV \(5.34.2, and
2.55.5\). Thus, we can confidently have the form ululā eligible for inclusion in
the present list. Compare the other included sound-imitation alalā.
17. Kakajā́. For instance: kakajā́kr̥tā \(AV 11.10.25\). This belongs to
the same type of gatis listed under P.1.4.61 \(ऊर्यादिच्विडाचश्च\).
18. Svā́hā. For example: svāhākārám \(AV 15.14.8\). The item svā́hā
is listed as a gati under P.1.4.61 \(ऊर्यादिच्विडाचश्च\).

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका497
19. Svadhā́. For example: svadhākārám \(AV 15.14.7\). The item
svadhā́ is listed as a gati under P.1.4.61 \(ऊर्यादिच्विडाचश्च\).
20. Śrát. For example: śraddhéyam \(AV 4.30.4\). The item śrát is
listed as a gati under P.1.4.61 \(ऊर्यादिच्विडाचश्च\).
21. Svàr. For example: svargáḥ \(AV 9.5.16\) analyzed by the
Padapāṭha as svaḥ-gáḥ. P.1.1.37 \(स्वरादिनिपातमव्ययम्\) includes svar among in-
declinables.
22. Alalā. There is no example for alalā in AV. However, alalā is
found compounded in the following usage: alalābhávantīḥ \(RV 4.18.6\) ‘mak-
ing the sound alalā,’ cf. Sāyaṇa: अललेत्येवंरूपं शब्दं कुर्वत्यः.. Such compounding
be covered by P.1.4.62 \(अनुकरणं चानितिपरम्\), giving the status of gati to the
sound-imitation alalā. This solves the puzzle of svaralalā which Whitney was
unable to solve. It also shows that this list is not restricted to items from the
AV, but includes items from other textual traditions.
Whitney further comments: “There are two words which we especially
miss in this list of upasargavr̥ttīni, and can hardly believe to have been origi-
nally absent from it: they are antaḥ and āviḥ : I cannot, however, find by emen-
dation any place for them in the text as it stands.” It is difficult to say why
these words are not included in the list. These are examples of gatis in the
Pāṇinian tradition. The word antaḥ as a gati is covered by P.1.4.65 \(अन्तर-
परिग्रहे\), and āvis as a gati is covered under P.1.4.61 \(ऊर्यादिच्विडाचश्च\).
Perhaps another enumeration ascribed to Śākaṭāyana did include the
particle antar. Referring to Śākaṭāyana’s view, the Br̥haddevatā \(2.95\) says:
अच्छश्रदन्तरित्येतानाचार्यः शाकटायनः ।
उपसर्गान्क्रियायोगान्मेने ते तु त्रयोऽधिकाः ॥
Finally, I believe that this entire initial portion probably represents a
very ancient incorporation into the text of the original CA. However, since all
manuscripts of the CA, except C, contain them, I believe that the text of the
CA, as it can be reconstructed on the basis of the manuscripts, must incorpo-
rate these passages. Clearly, the archetype of all our manuscripts must have
had this portion. However, it is most likely that they were incorporated into the
text of the CA after the CAB. While the CAB itself probably did not know
these verses as part of the text of the CA, and therefore did not comment on
them, the copyists of the manuscripts of the CAB definitely knew them, and
they did incorporate these uncommented verses in their manuscripts. Also see
the note on the colophon for this Pāda for a serious disagreement on the num-
ber of rules in this Pāda. 
A possible hint is provided by Bhārgava-Bhāskara for the importance
of the views of Śākaṭāyana to the later followers of Śaunakīya AV, that, while

अध्याय ४, पाद १
498
professing themselves to be followers of Śaunaka, they often disregarded
Śaunaka’s precepts in preference to those of Śākaṭāyana, cf. Bhārgava-
Bhāskara’s commentary on CA \(1.1.10\): अत्र वेदे तु प्रथमपद्यो गृह्यते शाकटायनानु-
सरणात्. The presence of such a large extract supposedly from a work of Śāka-
ṭāyana, or a work from his tradition, may be an indication of such influence on
the CA tradition. Also see CA 4.1.52, and the CAB on that rule.

Whitney \(4.1\). A, B, C: °र्ग्र°. D: उपसर्ग आख्यातेनोदात्ते । न समस्यते. O:
°आख्यातेन चोदात्तेन°.
Translation: A pre-verb \(upasarga\) is compounded with an
accented verb.
Note: In the situation envisioned by this rule, the pre-verb \(upasarga\)
is unaccented and the verb is accented. Whitney says: “This is the well-known
usage of all the Vedic pada-texts, at least so far as they have been brought to
general knowledge. With a true appreciation of the slightness of the bond
which connects a verb with its prefix, the constructors of the disjoined text
have ordinarily treated the two as independent words: unless, indeed, by laws
of accentuation of the sentence, the usually enclitic verb retains its accent and
becomes proclitic; and then the two are written together as a compound.”

\(पद, अ.वे. १.७.२\)।
Note: This rule is comparable to part of APR \(12a\). However, the ex-
amples listed under APR \(12a\) are not identical with the examples cited here by

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका499
the CAB. Since the positive examples of the rules do not form a closed gaṇa,
one can guess that there was no standard list of such examples. 
The distinction between samāsa and non-samāsa manifests itself in the
Padapāṭha, where an upasarga combined as a samāsa with the verb form is
separated in the Padapāṭha by an Avagraha. On the other hand, an upasarga
which is not combined as a samāsa with the verb is separated from that verb in
the Padapāṭha as a separate word.
The commentary makes an interesting observation. It refers to two
classes of items, the upasargas and the upasargavr̥ttis ‘words which behave
like upasargas, but are not upasargas.’ Items like puras have been categorized
as upasargavr̥tti in CA \(4.1.22\). As discussed in the note on that rule, it is not
clear whether the author of the CAB was familiar with the verses at the begin-
ning of this Pāda. It is also likely that it was the CAB that cited the entire pas-
sage in the beginning, and then, for some reason, it was incorporated into the
text of the CA.
४.१.२४. अनेकोऽनुदात्तेनापि ।
Whitney \(4.2\).
Translation: When there is more than one pre-verb
\[preceding the verb\], they are \[all\] compounded even with an
unaccented verb.
Note: It may be noted that CA \(4.1.5-6\) formulate this rule in a
somewhat different way, and it seems most likely that they were not part of the
‘original’ CA, but were extracted from a different grammatical tradition and
added to the text of the CA at some point. 
As Whitney points out: “If more prepositions than one are compounded
with an unaccented verb, only one of them, the one next the verb, is accented,
the others becoming proclitic. In such a case, the constructors of the pada-text
have very properly combined all with the verb, instead of simply putting the
prepositions together, since it is not the relation of the former to the latter
preposition that costs the former its accent, but rather their common relation to
the verb : we have not a compound preposition, but a duplicate verbal com-
pound. A later rule \(rule 7 = CA 4.1.29, below\) teaches us that in such a com-
bination the first of the prepositions is separated by avagraha from the rest.”
The rule seems to leave open the possibility, not discussed by Whitney,
that a multiplicity of pre-verbs may be compounded with an accented verb as

अध्याय ४, पाद १
500
well. However, all the examples offered here are examples of unaccented
verbs. See the Notes on CA \(4.1.5-6\).

Note: The CAB lists here the first four instances out of a total list of
fifty-seven instances found in the APR \(13\). The instances are cited exactly in
the same order. The CA rule is itself identical with, and perhaps is a quotation
in, APR \(13c\). The notion that certain prepositional items are anarthaka in
certain contexts is also seen in P.1.4.93 \(अधिपरी अनर्थकौ\). The KV on this rule
says that the items adhi and pari are given the designation karmapravacanīya,
when not bearing any meaning, in order to prevent the designations gati and
upasarga : गत्युपसर्गसंज्ञाबाधनार्था कर्मप्रवचनीयसंज्ञा विधीयते. Our rule here, and the
commentary on it, seem to differentiate between the categories anarthaka and
karmapravacanīya. Neither the CAB nor the APR explain as to which exam-
ples are offered to illustrate which type. However, a related discussion of
some of these issues is found under APR \(3, p. 4\):

Whitney \(1862: 186\) says: “The term anyayukta probably means ‘be-
longing to another verb,’ but such cases are quite rare in the text : an instance
of the kind intended is perhaps níḥ stuvānásya pātaya \(i.8.3\), where the prepo-
sition niḥ belongs to the verb pātaya, and not the intervening participle, to
which it would otherwise be attached, with loss of its own accent. Pāṇini’s
karmapravacanīya is comprehensive enough to include all the cases to which
our rules apply.” 
A similar example of anyayukta is offered by the APR passage cited
above, e.g. AV \(18.2.54\), where pra is not compounded with vidvān, since pra
is semantically related to cyāvayatu, rather than to vidvān. To this extent,
Whitney’s understanding seems to be correct. 
However, Whitney is not correct in suggesting that cases like these
would be subsumed under Pāṇini’s notion of karmapravacanīya. As I have
pointed out above, Pāṇini’s notion of karmapravacanīya, subsumes the in-
stances of anarthaka, cf. P.1.4.93. However, there is no reason to believe that

अध्याय ४, पाद १
502
instances of anyayukta would be covered under his notion of karmapravcanīya.
The compounding of anyayukta items would be prevented by the general con-
vention set by P.2.1.1 \(समर्थः पदविधिः\), which lays down the rule that processes
like compounding take place only for the items which are semantically and
syntactically related to each other. Interestingly, the APR \(3\), which is identi-
cal with P.2.1.1, has the same import, and the APR specifically prohibits com-
pounding because of the lack of sāmarthya ‘semantic/syntactic relationship,’ cf.
APR \(13b, p. 12\): 
उपसर्गपूर्वमाख्यातं यत्रोभाभ्यां समस्यते ।
सामर्थ्यमुभयोस्तत्रासामर्थ्येषु विग्रहः ॥
Commenting on the present rule, Whitney exerts to bring together a
large collection of instances for “this and the two following rules, since they
evidently form a single class, and are only formally distinct from one another.”
Now that we have access to Surya Kanta’s APR, we can be certain that these
two gaṇas were treated as distinct gaṇas, and they are listed separately in that
text. The examples offered by the CAB appear to be the first few citations of
the long lists found in the APR. Further, the APR brings out some crucial dif-
ferences which are not overtly mentioned by the CA, or the CAB.

Translation: In abhi vipaśyāmi etc., the first \[prepositional

its accent and independence before another preposition which is itself made
proclitic and combined with a following accented verb.”

Note: The CAB lists here the first four instances out of a total of
seven listed in the APR \(12c\). The passages occur exactly in the same order as
found in the APR. The APR rule \(12c\) says: “When an accented verb is pre-
ceded by two prepositions, separated \(from the second preposition\+verb\) are
such items as are used without significance, or as karmapravacanīyas, or con-
nected with something else.” While the CA rule simply makes a reference to a
list, the APR \(12c\) provides a more detailed description, and a reasoning. It
still leaves a logical possibility open that an accented verb could be com-
pounded with two pre-verbs, which are not anarthaka, karmapravacanīya, or
anyayukta. However, I have not found any such instances.
४.१.२७. योनावध्यैरयन्तादिषु च ।
Whitney \(4.5\).
Translation: \[The preverb is separated from the verb as an
independent word in the Padapāṭha\] in examples such as yónāv
ádhy aírayanta \(AV 2.1.5\).
Note: Whitney says: “This rule applies to such cases ... as show an
accented and independent preposition immediately before an accented verb.”

Note: As Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 56\) points out the gaṇa
referred to in this CA rule occurs fully in APR \(12b\), and the CAB lists all the
examples exactly in the same order. 
Referring to the last example cited by the CAB, Whitney says: “The
citation of the last passage seems to imply that the commentator regarded
bhūma as a verbal form, from the root bhū; but he can hardly, except in the
forgetfulness of a moment, have been guilty of so gross a blunder.” Also see:

अध्याय ४, पाद १
504
Surya Kanta \(APR, Notes, p. 6\). While one must agree with Whitney and
Surya Kanta that bhūma is not a verb, it is now clear that the CAB was not
alone in including this example in this list, but the APR \(p. 11\) also includes it
in the same list, and the shared example shows a close connection between
these two texts, to the point of having shared conceptual errors.

Translation: \[There is separation of the pre-verb from the
verbs\] āśī́3ḥ \(AV 11.3.26\) and babhūvā̃́3, because the pro-
longed \[i.e. pluta, vowel of the verbs\] is \[already\] effected
\(siddha\).

आ॒शी\[३\]ः’ \(पद, ११.३.२६\)। ‘आ । ब॒भू॒वाँ३’ \(पद,
अ.वे. १०.२.२८\)।
Note: On this rule, Whitney says: “That is to say, if I do not misap-
prehend the meaning of the rule, owing to the recognition of the final syllable
of each word as a protracted one. To what end the precept is given, unless the
words referred to \(x.2.28 and xi.3.26, 27\) have an irregular accent on the pro-
tracted syllable, I do not see. If accented, they would have a right, by the first
rule of this chapter \(= CA 4.1.23\), to combination with the preceding preposi-
tion; but, the present rule virtually says, they are seen to lose this right upon a
recognition of the fact that the accented vowel is protracted, and that its accent
is therefore of an anomalous character. It has been already noticed \(under i.
105 = CA 1.4.14\) that a part of our manuscripts accent babhūvā̃́3 in the latter
of the two passages referred to : not one gives an accent to āśī3ḥ, in either case
of its occurrence.”
The VVRI edition goes with the majority of the manuscripts and gives
the accent of babhūvā̃́3 as antodātta, while it notes the unaccented reading given
by the Whitney-Roth edition in the footnote. Also in prá āśī́3ḥ \(AV 11.3.26,
27\), the VVRI edition gives the accented reading. In view of the fact that P.8.
2.97 \(विचार्यमाणानाम्\) which sanctions the pluta vowel also ensures the udātta

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका505
accent for the pluta vowel, this reading seems appropriate. In contrast with
this, the non-pluta reading for prá āśīḥ in AV \(11.3.28\) is unaccented, and, as
the Padapāṭha shows, the accented preverb prá is compounded with the
unaccented āśīḥ in AV \(11.3.28\). On the other hand, in AV \(11.3.26, 27\), the
accented preverb prá is not compounded with the accented pluta form āśī́3ḥ. 
It is in the process of becoming pluta that the vowel also becomes ac-
cented. Pāṇini’s rules for pluta and its accent are in the section beginning with
P.8.2.82 \(वाक्यस्य टेः प्लुत उदात्तः\), and the convention set by P.8.2.1 \(पूर्वत्रासिद्धम्\)
says that, for rules preceding P.8.2.1, the results of rules coming afterwards are
treated as if not effected \(asiddha\), and that even among the rules which follow
P.8.2.1, any given rule does not recognize the following rules and their results.
The words siddha and asiddha are crucial in this context, and perhaps the CA is
alluding to some such distinction. The CA seems to be saying that, in the
context of compounding with the pre-verb, the accent of the pluta vowel is to
be treated as a fully valid result. In both the examples cited under this rule, the
pre-verbs are accented, as well as the verbs, and hence there is no
compounding. The Padapāṭha generally does not have a compound-expression
with two udātta syllables in it. This is probably what goes against the
compounding in the present case, and this is also probably why the rule uses
प्लुतस्वरस्य सिद्धत्वात् as a reason.
४.१.२९. पूर्वेणावग्रहः ।
Whitney \(4.7\). B, D, J, M: पूर्वेणाविग्रहः. I: 48. The numbering in I indi-
cates that the earlier verses were considered to be part of the text of the CA.
Perhaps, the verses were broken down into multiple rules in some text-tradi-
tions.
Translation: \[In the Padapāṭha\], there is separation with an
avagraha \[i.e. pause marking the separation of a member of a

marking the separation of independent words,\] of the first \[of
the many preverbs from the rest, which are left joined to the
verb\].

Note: Whitney observes: “The avagraha, or pause of separation
between the two parts of a compound word, is defined by two of the Prāti-
śākhyas \(as has been already remarked, in the note following iii. 74 = CA
3.3.25\) as having the length of a mora. From here to the end of section II \(rule
72 = CA 4.2.26\), the treatise is occupied with rules for its employment or
omission. And, in the first place, with however many propositions a verbal
form may be compounded, it is always the first of them that is separated from
the rest of the compound by avagraha.” Rule CA \(3.3.35: ऋगर्धर्चपदान्तावग्रहविवृ-
त्तिषु मात्राकालः कालः\), also says that the avagraha is of one mora duration, but
so is the pause between words \(padānta\). See Notes on CA \(3.3.19\) and CA
\(3.3.35\). Another general principle is that irrespective of the number of
members a compound-expression may have, there is only one avagraha. 
४.१.३०. यातुमावत् ।
Whitney \(4.8\). I: 49. P combines this with the following rule.
Translation: In the expression yātumāvat, \[the former mem-
ber, i.e. yātu, is separated from the rest of the members with an
avagraha\].
Note: Whitney says: “It comes in rather awkwardly here, as only
prepositions have been contemplated, thus far in the chapter, as former con-
stituents of compounds.” However, it is clear that, as an exceptional item, it
had to be taken care of somewhere. The assumption seems to be that the word
has three members, i.e. yātu-mā-vat. However, in the Padapāṭha, only the first
item is separated with an avagraha. 
The CAB also cites another view that -māvat is a single affix having the
same meaning as -mat.
The word yātumāvat appears several times in the RV \(1.36.20; 7.1.5;
7.104.23; and 8.49.20\), where the Padapāṭha follows the same division as pre-
scribed by our rule. However, perhaps through oversight, Surya Kanta \(1981:
546\) cites this expression divided as yātumā́\+vat.

Note: Whitney says: “The ca in the rule evidently continues the impli-
cation simply of avagraha from rule 7 \(= CA 4.1.29\), and the connection of the
text casts upon yātumāvat the suspicion of being an interpolation.” While one
feels like agreeing with Whitney, one must note that all manuscripts contain the
rule yātumāvat, and, therefore, if this is an interpolation, it must be a very an-
cient interpolation, certainly predating the composition of the CAB.

member, is separated with an avagraha, and not the members of
the old compound\].

\(पद, अ.वे. २.३४.४\)। प्रजानां पतिः ।
‘प्र॒जा-प॑तिऽसृष्टः’ \(पद, अ.वे. १०.६.१९\)।
Note: As Whitney explains: “The word prajā is itself divisible as a
compound - thus, pra-jā \(e.g. vii.35.3\); upon farther adding pati, the former
division is given up in favor of that between the old compound and its added
member, and we have prajā-pati \(e.g. ii.34.4\); and a similar addition and re-
moval of the pause of separation gives us prajāpati-sr̥ṣṭaḥ : while we might
have, did the words occur, the yet farther change prajāpatisr̥ṣṭaḥ-iva, or
prajāpatisr̥ṣṭi-bhiḥ, and prajāpatisr̥ṣṭibhiḥ-iva. In no compound is the separation
by avagraha made at more than one point, and it is always the member last ap-
pended which is entitled to separation.”
This rule presents a very important observation as regards the division
of compounds. It implicitly recognizes that certain compounds are already in
use and are fully entrenched in the language, and then other members are added
to them. Thus, one should not assume that a compound with three members,
e.g. ABC, could be split in all sorts of possible ways. One must take into
account which members are entrenched in the usage. Otherwise, one could
possibly argue that pra has been added to a prior compound jāpati. This is
unacceptable, because no expression like jāpati is in use. On the other hand,
the expression prajā is in use. Thus, the practice of separating compounds by
avagraha provides us significant insight into how the ancient grammarians
looked at the relation of the linguistic usage and the grammatical theory. Com-
pare P.2.1.4 \(सह सुपा\), which, with the continuation of sup from P.2.1.2, lays
down the general principle that, at a time, only one noun is compounded with
another noun. Thus, generally, a multi-member compound must be succes-
sively built through incorporation of prior compounds. This general discus-
sion is also taken up by the Vārttikas \(25 ff.\) on P.2.1.1, MB \(Kielhorn edn.,
Vol.I., pp. 372-3. For a detailed discussion, see: S.J. Joshi \(1968: 168-208\).
It may be noted that the grammarians did not bother themselves with the ques-
tion of avagraha, and that dimension was left for the Prātiśākhyas.
४.१.३३. सुप्राव्या च ।
Whitney \(4.11\). A, B, D, H, M: सुप्राच्या च.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका509
Translation: Also in the expression suprāvyā \(AV 4.30.6\),
\[the last member is separated with an avagraha\].
Note: As Whitney says: “In the word specified the last member is
separated from the rest of the compound, and not the first, as would be more in
accordance with the general analogies of the system of separation.” Normally,
with a verbal noun with two preverbs, the first preverb is separated with an
avagraha, cf. CA 4.1.7 and the Note on this rule.

‘अवतेः \[सु\]प्रपूर्वस्य टाशब्दः स्वरितः परः ।
सुप्रावीति तृतीयायाः क्षैप्रः छन्दसि स्वर्यते ॥’ 
\(source?\)
Note: For the expression ṭāśabdaḥ in the verse, Whitney proposes the
emendation yaśabdaḥ. However, the expression ṭā here refers to the instru-
mental singular affix in the Pāṇinian tradition, cf. Pāṇini 4.1.2. Thus, this tra-
dition looks at the word suprāvyā as a feminine instrumental singular from the
base suprāvī. Whitney mistakenly interprets the verse as suggesting a deriva-
tion with the desiderative suffix yā, but then says: “Such an explanation, of
course, would be futile, being sufficiently disproved by the accent alone.” As
is clear, the verse does not propose such an interpretation in the first place.
Sāyaṇa offers the reading suprāvye, perhaps under the influence of RV
\(10.125.2\). The same reading is recorded by some AV manuscripts as noted
in the VVRI edition. This perhaps shows the increasing influence from the
RV tradition upon that of the AV in the post-CA period. For further dis-
cussion of the RV and the AV readings, see Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p.
201\). Also note that the RV Padapāṭha separates members of this word in the
same way as taught by this rule, and it may be that the exceptional character of
this division is influenced by the RV tradition.
The word suprāvī appears several times in the RV \(1.34.4, 1.60.1,
1.83.1, 2.13.9, and 4.26.5\), and in each case the word is split as supra-avī in
the Padapāṭha. The word duṣprāvī also appears in RV \(4.25.6\) and it is split in
an analogous way in the Padapāṭha. The word prāvī also appears in the RV
\(4.9.2\), where the Padapāṭha splits its as pra-avī.

अध्याय ४, पाद १
510
The exceptional division of the word in the Padapāṭha may imply that,
somehow, the words su and dus were not deemed by the author of the
Padapāṭha as modifying the whole compound prāvī, but just the portion pra in
it. This is analogous to the use of the adverb ‘very’ in English in a phrase like
a very good person. Here, very goes with good, rather than with person.
However, the presence of the compound prāvī, and the absence of just supra or
duṣpra made it seem like, the normal avagraha may have been like su-prāvī or
duḥ-prāvī. Since this was not the case, a separate rule to note the exception had
to be given.
४.१.३४. अनिङ्गेन पूर्वेण ।
Whitney \(4.12\). I: °निंग्ये°. O: °निंग्येण°. P adds a daṇḍa after this rule as
a correction. 
Translation: When \[the new compounding is with an indi-
visible item\], the old \[member is separated with an avagraha\].

\(source?\)
Note: Here, the assumption seems to be that the original compound-
ing in the form sukṣetriyā is with su\+kṣetri, to which the new member yā is
added. However, this new member yā being inseparable, the separation with
an avagraha is carried out with the old member su. This is the same logic with
the example sugātuyā. CA \(4.1.52\) and the CAB on it specify that the separa-
tion with yā occurs only in five forms, and nowhere else. See the CAB on CA
\(4.1.52\):

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका511

Thus, while we agree with Whitney that yā is not a universally aniṅgya
affix, he fails to take due notice of the fact that it is divisible only in the five
forms cited above, and nowhere else. This is what makes the two cited cases
su-kṣetriyā and su-gātuyā proper examples.
However, the situation with the three additional examples offered by
the CAB is different. Why are the compounds sā́ntardeśāḥ, sahásūktavākaḥ,
and suprajā́ḥ offered as examples of this rule? The CAB seems to assume that
the original compound is sāntar, which is then connected to an indivisible deśa.
Similarly, it seems to assume that sahasūkta is an original compound, which is
subsequently compounded with an indivisible vākaḥ. Finally, it assumes that
supra is the original compound, which is subsequently compounded with an
indivisible ja. Such assumptions are difficult to comprehend. We must agree
with Whitney: “I do not see how this statement can be accepted as a correct
one; for, of the compounds consisting of more than two members, the last is
even more often separated from the first two than the first from the last two.”
My own guess is that the original CA rule applies appropriately to su-
kṣetriyā́ and su-gātuyā́. However, the CAB has mixed up several unrelated
rules and their examples. The first two examples are not there in the text of the
cited verses, and the verses seem to refer to a slightly different doctrine:
“Where there are two possible places for separation, an earlier one and a later
one, the separation takes place with the earlier one. This is illustrated by su-
kṣetriyā́, sá-antardeśāḥ, and su-prajā́ḥ.” This doctrine has nothing to do with
the present rule, and thus the confusion. Here, the words pūrva and para are
used in spacial sense, rather than in temporal order in which the compound
develops.
The disparate nature of these examples is also indicated by the fact that
the APR accounts for them in diverse ways. APR \(122, p. 83\) reads: सु इत्येते-
नोपसर्गेण. There is separation of the upasarga su with an avagraha. As ex-
amples are offered su-kṣetriyā́ and su-gātuyā́ from AV \(4.33.2\). One suspects
that su-prajā́ḥ \(AV 4.11.3\) would be accounted for by the same rule. The ex-
ample sá-antardeśāḥ \(AV 9.5.37\) is accounted for under APR \(128-129, p. 90\)
which says that sá-, the reduced form of sahá, is separated with an avagraha.
Also see CA \(4.1.10\) for a different explanation for sahá-sūktavākaḥ and sá-

अध्याय ४, पाद १
512
antardeśāḥ. The only reason the CAB was able to bring all these examples to-
gether is that in all these the separation with an avagraha takes place with the
first item. This surface similarity, in addition to the word pūrveṇa in the CA
rule and in the cited verse, seems to have led the CAB to bring all these
examples together. They could all come together under the rule as phrased in
the cited verse, but not under the rule as phrased in CA \(4.1.34\).
४.१.३५. तद्धिते धा ।

Translation: Dhā́, when it is a taddhita-suffix, \[is separated

Note: Referring to an exception, Whitney says: “On the other hand,
the text offers a single exception to the rule, viśvádhā \(vi.85.3\), which neither
the Prātiśākhya nor its commentary notices : it is accented on the penult, while
all the other compounds with dhā accent the suffix itself.” Here, it may be
noted that, for the viśvádhā yatī́ḥ of the AV text, Sāyaṇa reads viśvadhāyanīḥ,
and Paippalāda AV \(19.6.3\) reads viśvadhāyasaḥ, suggesting that we have
here a suspect reading which may not have been known as viśvádhā to the
author of the CA or the CAB.
Also, referring to the added rule in the commentary, Whitney says:
“vyatyayasvaśraddīrghebhyo dhāpratyaye na avagraho bhavati; ‘the suffix dhā
does not suffer separation after ... \(?\), sva, śrat, and a long vowel.’ The words
svadhā and śraddhā, into which the root dhā enters as last member, are here
referred to, and perhaps godhā \(iv.3.6\); but to what the first item in the enu-
meration refers, I have not succeeded in discovering.” The first word, by
adding a visarga after it, is nothing but the word vyatyayaḥ, which also appears
in Patañjali’s MB \(on P.1.4.9, Kielhorn edn., Vol.I., p. 315, etc.\) in the sense

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका513
of transposition or deviation. Thus, the cited rule seems to be saying that, in
deviation from the normal CA rule, the item dhā is not separated after sva, śrat,
and a long vowel. The words śraddhā and svadhā are not analyzed by the
Padapāṭha. However, this really cannot be an exception to the normal CA rule,
since the present CA rule applies only if dhā is a taddhita affix. Clearly svadhā
and śraddhā are not taddhita formations, but derived from the root dhā. For
dhā coming after a long vowel, Whitney suggests “perhaps godhā \(iv.3.6\).” A
genuine taddhita formation with a long vowel before dhā is the word tredhā́
\(AV 1.12.1\) which is not divided by the Padapāṭha with an avagraha, cf. CA
\(4.2.20\).
४.१.३६. त्राकारान्ते ।
Whitney \(4.14\). 
Translation: Also the affix trā, when it ends in ā, \[is sepa-
rated with an avagraha\].
Note: The qualification ākārānte is to distinguish trā from the affix
tra. While the former is separated with an avagraha in the Padapāṭha, the latter
is not. Whitney makes an important observation: “Doubtless it is the character
of the forms to which tra is attached, as being pronominal roots, that prevents
its separation from them, rather than anything in the suffix itself. The ablative
suffix tas is not separated, even when it follows a word having an independent
status in the language, as in abhitas.”

Note: Whitney observes: “Here, again, it is evidently not the length of
the words to which the suffix is appended, as monosyllables or polysyllables,
that determines its separability, but the character of the former as pronominal
roots and of the latter as nominal themes.” A crucial example to test Whitney’s
assessment might be a word like sarvathā. However, it does not appear in the
ŚAV. It appears in Paippalāda AV \(9.10.5\), but I have not been able to con-
sult the Padapāṭha for PAV.

Note: Referring to the counter-examples aśvatarásya \(AV 4.4.8\) and
aśvataryàḥ \(AV 8.8.22\), Whitney comments: “The citation of these words in
this manner, as if they were excluded by the very form of the rule itself from
falling under its operation, suggests as the true reading and interpretation of the
rule taratamapoḥ, ‘tara and tama when unaccented,’ giving to the indicatory
letter p the same force which it has as appended to the same suffixes by Pāṇini
\(e.g. v.3.55, 57\). My copy of the manuscript, indeed, gives m everywhere
taratamayoḥ; but, considering the small difference between y and p when hast-
ily formed, I cannot be confident that the Hindu scribe did not mean to write
the latter.” Now that we have a large number of manuscripts, Whitney’s ex-
pectation is not supported. 
My guess is that the commentator, in asking the question तरतमयोरिति
किमर्थम्, means to suggest that by juxtaposing the affixes tara and tama in this
fashion, the rule naturally makes it clear that these words refer to comparative
and superlative affixes, and not to just any homophonic affixes. Such an infer-
ence excludes aśvatarásya etc., since the affix -tara in this example does not
have the meaning of the comparative affix.
Then, the commentator takes up the question as to why there is no
separation in the forms katará and katamá, yatará and yatamá. This is answered
by saying that these are not the affixes -tara and -tama, but a different set of
affixes, i.e. -atara and -atama. The verse cited after this says that when an affix
like -atara is added, only the initial consonant of the base remains, the rest is
deleted, i.e. yat\+atara > y\+atara > yatara.

अध्याय ४, पाद १
516
Commenting on this discussion, Whitney remarks: “This distinction of
the suffixes as applied to pronominal roots from those applied to other themes
is evidently artificial and false. The difference is that the roots themselves are
not, like derivative themes, detachable from the suffixes appended to them - as
we have seen to be the case under the two preceding rules.” Whitney does not
note that the commentator is following a standard method, also found in Pāṇi-
nian grammar, where these special suffixes are given with a special marker Ḍ,
i.e. ḌataraC and ḌatamaC, and by the force of this marker Ḍ, the final portion
of the base beginning with its final vowel \(= ṬI\) is deleted, cf. P.5.3.92
\(किंयत्तदो निर्द्धारणे द्वयोरेकस्य डतरच्\) and P.5.3.93 \(वा बहूनां जातिपरिप्रश्ने डतमच्\),
P.6.4.143 \(टेः\). Thus, Pāṇini’s procedure is exactly the same as that given by
the CAB. Whitney also misses a major distinction. While the comparative and
superlative affixes are unaccented affixes, marked with P by Pāṇini, i.e. -taraP
and -tamaP, the affixes in forms like katará and katamá are accented affixes,
marked with the marker C by Pāṇini, i.e. ḌataraC and ḌatamaC. Thus,
Whitney is not accurate in saying that the distinction of the suffixes as applied
to pronominal roots from those applied to other themes is evidently artificial
and false. It is a real difference recognized by both Pāṇini and the CAB.
The last verse cited by the commentator refers to words in the sa-
mudrādigaṇa referred to in CA \(4.2.8\) and fully listed in APR \(217c, examples
59ff\). Words in the samudrādigaṇa are not separated by an avagraha in the
Padapāṭha. The APR \(p. 155\) lists gótamaḥ, kataráḥ, katamáḥ, yatarā́, yata-
máḥ, aśvatarásya, and aśvataryàḥ in the samudādi gaṇa, and the verse cited by
the CAB seems to make a reference to it. However, a substantial portion of the
verse remains unintelligible, unless d is read as: tasmān neṅgati gotamaḥ.
As the VVRI edition of the AV shows, a number of manuscripts sup-
port the reading gautamam for AV \(4.29.6\). The manuscript H may have de-
rived this reading from this tradition. However, looking at the context of the
discussion, the reading intended by the CAB must be gotamam. The verse in
the commentary points out that the affix -tama in the word gótama is not in the
superlative sense \(anatiśāyane\), and therefore it is not analyzed in the
Padapāṭha.
For a discussion of the example AV \(1.34.4\), see the note on CA \(2.1.

Note: Referring to the examples mā́rta-vatsam, ā-vayám, and vā́dhū-
yam, Whitney says: “He must have been nodding when he added the last three
words, of which the third has no suffix beginning with v, and the two others

अध्याय ४, पाद १
518
are not formed by suffixes, but by composition.” Also see Whitney \(AV
Transl. Vol.II., p. 498\). As for mā́rtavatsam, it is clear that there is no taddhita
affix beginning with v, though clearly the word is a secondary taddhita forma-
tion from an original mr̥tavatsa. Contrast with ā-vayám \(AV 8.6.26\), the indi-
visible example ā́vayaḥ \(AV 6.16.2\). Both of these are specifically mentioned
in the APR \(217g, p. 158\) precisely in the same context. Thus, the examples
of the CAB are appropriate as far as their divisibility is concerned, though their
grammatical characterizations are not always accurate.
Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p. 255\) notes that “the pada-text does not
divide druváyaḥ, but the case is quoted in the comment to Prāt. iv.18 \(= CA
4.1.40\) as an exceptional one, vaya being regarded as a suffix added to dru.”
However, we should note that the expression druváyaḥ is not listed by the
APR in its samudrādi-gaṇa, a list of indivisible words, and hence there is room
to speculate whether it was divisible for the APR.
Referring to two more examples in the commentary, Whitney says: “It
is curious that both ā-vayam and mārta-vatsam are quoted in the commentary to
Prāt. iv.18 \(= CA 4.1.40\), as if their second member were a taddhita beginning
with v.” To recognize that the APR and the CAB are genetically linked, we
should note that the unattested examples āmayāvī, mekhalāvī, medhāvī quoted
by the CAB are also found in APR \(p. 156\) which lists words whose members
are inseparable. The CAB tries to cover these examples with an exception rule,
while the APR tries to cover these examples by incorporating them in the
samudrādigaṇa, a list of indivisible words.

Whitney \(4.19\). I: 60. P adds a daṇḍa after this rule as a correction.

Note: Whitney remarks with respect to the counter-examples in the
CAB : “cases which it was very unnecessary to cite, since their suffix, if they
have one, is śa, not śas.” However, one may point out that the Prātiśākhya
may be looking at a more basic surface level, where the expressions end in śaḥ.
The citation kīnā́śāḥ is probably suggestive of the singular form kīnāśaḥ which
ends in śaḥ.
It may be noted that the APR \(p. 139\) mentions aṅkuśáḥ in its samu-
drādigaṇa, a list of indivisible words, but not kīnā́śāḥ. The APR \(p. 137\) lists
śúnāsīrā, from the same verse \(AV 3.17.5\) in which the word kīnā́śāḥ appears,
among indivisible items. This leaves open a possibility that the APR knew
kīnā́śāḥ as a divisible word.

Note: Pāṇini’s rule 4.4.142 \(सर्वदेवात्तातिल्\) prescribes the affix tātiL,
and interestingly, the CA seems to cite this affix along with its marker L, which
indicates that the syllable preceding the suffix is udātta, cf. P.6.1.193 \(लिति\).
Whitney also notes that “the related suffix tā is never separated from the theme
to which it is appended.” 
The verses cited in the CAB under CA \(4.1.49\) also list tātiL. The
word ariṣṭátāti is derived by P.4.4.143 \(शिवशमरिष्टस्य करे\).

\(See the note below for an emended version.\)
Note: Whitney wonders whether the original reading might have been
dyusi, instead of dyubhi, because the indicatory letter bh is not known even in
Pāṇini, and that it would be better to assume the stem-form to be dyus. This
conjecture is supported by the manuscripts E, F, and I. However, the rest of
the manuscripts, and especially the commentary, clearly seem to have the
reading dyubhi, and I have retained that reading. The same word appears in the
verses cited under CA \(4.1.49\). Noting that even Pāṇini does not use bh as an
indicatory letter, Whitney says: “one is tempted to conjecture that the authors of
our system may have regarded dyus in these compounds as a contraction for
the instrumental plural dyubhis.” 
Regarding the verse cited in the CAB, Whitney says: “This evidently
has to do with the formation of anyedyus, accounting for the e which precedes
the suffix : but I can offer no entirely satisfactory restoration of the text.” My
emended text reads as follows:
‘अन्यस्य द्युभि त्वेत्वमन्ये वा द्युभिरिष्यते ।
लोप एद्युभि चान्त्यस्य सिद्धो वायं पुनर्द्युभि॥’
The verse seems to discuss a number of possible ways of dealing with
the derivation of anyedyuḥ. The first quarter of the verse seems to say that

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका521
before the affix dyu, the final vowel of anya changes to e \(= etvam\). The sec-
ond quarter seems to say that one could prescribe the affix dyu after the form
anye. The third alternative is to say that the affix is edyu, and that the final
vowel of anya is deleted. I cannot however make any clear sense of the last
quarter of the verse. We may note that P.5.3.22 offers anyedyuḥ as a nipātana,
an unanalyzed word. On the other hand, Kātyāyana in his Vārttika on this rule
\(6: पूर्वान्यान्यतरेतरापराधरोभयोत्तरेभ्यः एद्युसुच्\) suggests the affix edyusUC after
words like anya. Adding this affix, also implies the deletion of the final vowel
of anya, cf. P.6.4.148 \(यस्येति च\)Kātyāyana’s Vārttika \(7: द्युश्चोभयात्\) derives
ubhayadyuḥ by adding the affix dyus after the word ubhaya.

Note: Whitney observes: “This is most palpably a rule which has its
ground in the observed phenomena of the general language, and not in those of
the Atharva-Veda; for although, in the later language, mātra came to be used in
such a mode and sense as to give some ground for its treatment as a suffix, it is
in the Atharvan nothing but a noun.” We should note that P.5.2.37 \(प्रमाणे
द्वयसज्दघ्नञ्मात्रचः\) prescribes the affix mātraC, where the marker C ensures that
the final syllable of the formation is udātta. Thus, the practice of the Prāti-
śākhya is paralleled by that of Pāṇini. It should also be noted that mātra is cited
as an affix in the verses quoted in the CAB under CA \(4.1.49\).

Note: Whitney notes that manasmayam is the singular example of
non-separation. For some reason, the APR does not include this word among
its samudrādigaṇa, list of indivisible words, and this raises a possibility that
certain traditions may have considered this word as a separable word. This is
especially significant since the APR cites other parts of this verse, without
noting this peculiarity. Finally, we should note that the affix maya is listed in
the verses cited by the CAB on CA \(4.1.49\).

Note: Whitney understands the first verse cited by the commentator
as saying: “janitva following aditi is not to be treated as separable, as being
formed from the root jan by the suffix itva, which is not taught to be an ending
capable of constituting an independent word.” Cardona \(personal communi-
cation\) suggests that the reading kr̥jjanaparataḥ is to be restored most likely to
kr̥jjanaparaḥ or kr̥jjaniparaḥ. Such an emendation allows an overall better in-
terpretation for the verse: \(my translation\): “\[In the word\] janitva \[after the
word aditi in AV 7.6.1\], the kr̥t \[affix tva\] after jani is not separated. Or
\[perhaps, in the word janitva\], there is the affix -itva after \[the root\] jan. There-
fore, \[jan\] is not treated as a \[separable\] pada.” The second alternative is simi-
lar to the one taught by the Uṇādisūtra \(4.104\) which teaches the affix itvaN
after the root jan, where the marker N ensures that the first syllable of the word
becomes udātta. This is the explanation offered by Sāyaṇa on AV 7.6.1.
With reference to the example mahi tvam, Surya Kanta \(APR, Intro-
duction, p. 40\) appropriately points out Whitney’s error. Somehow, he was
unable to trace this example in AV, perhaps because he, for some unexplained
reason, treated these two words as one word in his edition of the AV \(12.1.55\).
This was quite clearly an error, and one must read: दे॒वै॒रुक्ता व्यस॑र्पो महि॒ त्वम्.
Here the word mahi is a feminine vocative, uncompounded with tvam. In fact,
the same matter is explained in the verse cited by the commentary. One should
also note that the VVRI edition makes the same mistake as Whitney, and it
reads mahitvam as a single word in the Saṃhitā, and mahi-tvam with an
avagraha in the Padapāṭha. Assuming that the Padapāṭha as given by the
VVRI edition reflects the manuscripts, this error must have been an old error,
and we need not fault Whitney. The context, however, supports the in-
terpretation of mahi as a vocative followed by the separate word tvam.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका525
Whitney interprets the third verse cited in the commentary as saying
that the word pitva is derived from the root pā with the Vedic suffix itva. I
doubt if this is what the verse means. The verse teaches the derivation from the
root pā , and then says that the ā of the root changes to i and that this change is
irregular, i.e. Vedic. The word itvam in the verse does not refer to an affix -
itva, but to the change of ā to i. As evidenced by Sāyaṇa’s commentary on AV
\(8.4.10\), the word pitvaḥ is a genitive singular of the stem pitu- and is para-
phrased by Sāyaṇa with the word annasya. The discussion is occasioned by
the fact that, on the face of it, the word has the element tva, and it is udātta, and
hence it should be subject to this rule. The verse points out that there is no
taddhita affix in this form, and hence it is not subject to the present rule.

Note: On some occasions, kr̥tvas is separated as an independent
word in the Padapāṭha, for example dáśa / kŕ̥tvaḥ \(AV 11.2.9\) and saptá /
kŕ̥tvaḥ \(AV 12.2.29\). On the other hand, it is compounded with a number
word in some instances, i.e. aṣṭa-kŕ̥tvaḥ \(AV 11.2.9\). The CA rule simply
says that this happens optionally because of the diverse behavior in the
Padapāṭha.
The CAB looks at the same situation and says that this is a case of
vyavasthitavibhāṣā “settled option,” namely that in certain known cases the
compounding takes place, and in certain other known cases it does not, and it is
not that in each case the compounding is optional.
This is further supported by the fine analysis presented in the first cited
verse. It says that the item kŕ̥tvaḥ, which is an accented item, is compounded
with unaccented number words like aṣṭa. However, it is not compounded with
accented number words saptá and dáśa. This goes far beyond the rule of the
CA in providing a rational reason for the diverse behavior of this item. Also
note the use of the word samāsa for a juncture of a taddhita affix in the CA rule.
On the other hand, perhaps to get over this oddity, the cited verse does not treat
kr̥tvas as a taddhita affix, but as a verbal noun, derived from the root kr̥ with
the kr̥t affix -tva. This makes it seem more like a normal compound in Pāṇini-
an terms. This perhaps shows that the cited verses are more sensitive to the
categories of the Pāṇinian grammar. Also note that the forms in which the
affixes are cited in the verses are closer to their Pāṇinian forms, cf. matup and
mayaṭ, P.5.2.94 \(तदस्यास्त्यस्मिन्निति मतुप्\) and P.5.4.21 \(तत्प्रकृतवचने मयट्\). The
CA rules \(4.1.39\) and \(4.1.46\) refer to matu and maya, rather than to matup
and mayaṭ.
The recognition that the last verse quoted in the commentary provides
an enumeration of all the suffixes thus far treated of as separable allows us to
reconstruct the text of that verse in a much more satisfactory way, in spite of
the sorry state of the manuscript. As a parallel to युवत्यादिषु तद्धितम् in the cited
verses, we find युवत्यादिषु तद्धिते in APR \(217a\). The wording धापर्यन्ताः in our
verses here may have a parallel in धोपनतेः in APR \(217a\).

Note: Surya Kanta \(APR, Intro., p. 39\) points to the fact that the ex-
amples of jātīya are not found in the Vulgate of the AV, and argues that, there-
fore, the Vulgate is not a genuine Śaunakīya recension, suggesting that
examples of jātīya must have occurred in a genuinely Śaunakīya text.
However, as Whitney notes, the examples of jātīya cited by the commentator
are identical with examples appearing in commentaries on Pāṇini \(5.3.69:
प्रकारवचने जातीयर्\). This would suggest that even the commentator did not find
any examples in the AV text known to him, and got his examples from his
exposure to the Pāṇinian tradition. It is thus very likely that the Gaṇa jātīyādi
itself was not a purely Atharvan Gaṇa, but was taken by the author of the CA
from some general grammar of Sanskrit. Whitney says: “What other fre-
quently occurring final members of compounds it may have pleased the authors
of our treatise to regard as suffixes, and to include in this gaṇa, I do not know.
I have noted no actual suffixes as needing to be comprehended in it.” 
It must be noted, however, that this general grammar used as a source
of information by the author of CA was not identical with Pāṇini’s grammar in
every respect. Thus, Pāṇini himself treats jātīya as an affix, and not as a
separate word forming a compound with another word. The CA, on the other
hand, thinks of some affixes being compounded with their bases. Also, there
is no jātīyādigaṇa in Pāṇini’s grammar.

Note: Whitney remarks: “Not one of the technical terms used in this
rule is known to me to occur elsewhere than in the grammatical language of our
treatise. ... Karmanāma, then, I have without much hesitation rendered by
‘participle;’ and tanmānin seems to me to mean ‘implying the making or doing
of that which the theme indicates,’ and so to be applicable to such words as
śatrūyanti, aghāyanti, where the signification is not simply desiderative : but of
this I do not feel altogether confident, and I have at one time sought in the word
a designation of the middle participles having the termination māna; prepsu I
think must belong to such derivative adjectives as devayu, śravasyu.” 
The term karmanāma is found in the Nirukta \(2.13\) in the sense of
action-noun, e.g. व्रतमिति कर्मनाम, as contrasted with sattvanāma ‘noun referring
to an object,’ Nirukta \(1.1\). The word karmanāma probably has an extended
sense of a noun derived from a verb, as evidenced by the fact that it is used to
refer to such words as apaḥ, apnaḥ, daṃsaḥ etc., cf. Nirukta \(3.1\): कर्म-
नामान्युत्तराणि षड्विंशतिः. Its further derivative कार्मनामिकः \(संस्कारः\) is also found
in the Nirukta \(1.13\) where it refers to a proper derivation of a noun from a
verb. Durga’s commentary on this passage says: कर्मकृतं नाम कर्मनाम । पाचक-
लावकादि । तस्मिन् भवः कार्मनामिकः संस्कारः. Here, in the CA rule, Whitney may
be correct in assuming that the word is used in a more restricted sense of
participle.
The expression tan-mānin is not found elsewhere in grammar, but its
meaning is similar to the meaning of आत्ममाने in Pāṇini \(3.2.83: आत्ममाने खश्च\).
Examples of this rule, such as दर्शनीयमानिन्, mean दर्शनीयमात्मानं मन्यते, namely,
‘though someone is actually not good-looking, he thinks himself to be good-

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका529
looking.’ This type of meaning is ascribed to the forms vr̥ṣāyámāṇaḥ and
śatrūyátīm, i.e. acting like x.
The word prepsu simply means ‘desirous,’ and is exemplified by
aghāyúḥ and śravasyavaḥ.
For a related rule and examples, see: CA \(3.1.18: इच्छायां च यकारादौ\),
and APR \(154: यकारादौ बहुलं दीर्घः\). The examples in the CAB on the present
rule are identical with the examples on APR \(154\).
४.१.५२. वस्ववस्वप्नसुम्नसाधुभिर्या ।
Whitney \(4.30\). A, B, D, P: °सुन्म°. J, M: वस्ववच°.
Translation: \[There is separation with an avagraha in the
Padapāṭha of the affix\] yā combined with vasu, ava, svapna,
sumna, and sādhu.
Note: The verse cited in the CAB reports Śākaṭāyana’s view that
separation with an avagraha occurs only in five words involving yā. The enu-
meration, both in the CA rule and in the cited verse, is important because yā is
not separated with an avagraha in other instances, e.g. su-kṣetriyā́ and su-
gātuyā́ in AV \(4.33.2\). These two words are offered as instances in the CAB
on CA \(4.1.34\). There are other words ending in -yā́ are not divisible
and are listed in the APR \(p. 154-3\) as members of the samudrādi-gaṇa, a list
of indivisible words, e.g. mithuyā́ \(AV 4.29.7\), amuyā́ \(AV 5.22.1\), bhadráyā
\(AV 3.30.3\), urviyā́ \(AV 5.12.5\). Here, bhadráyā has been included with
other forms, and yet its different accentuation shows that it is a different kind
of word. It is not clear why the division takes place in some words, and not in
others.

Note: On the example ava-yā, Whitney rightly says: “The second of
them is classed with the rest only by a blunder, since it is evidently avayās, the
irregular nominative singular of ava-yāj, and ought to be written by the pada-
text ava-yāḥ, instead of ava-yā.” While Whitney is philologically correct, the
form as sanctioned by the CA indicates that the form was understood differ-
ently by the Indian tradition. The VVRI edition reads अ॒व॒ऽयाः, but notes the
manuscript variant अ॒व॒ऽया. Sāyaṇa reads अवयाः and refers to P.8.2.67 for the
nipātana of the form अवयाः. The example sumna-yā is cited under APR \(7, ex-
ample 31\). The VVRI edition reads सु॒ऽगा॒तु॒या for AV \(4.33.2\), but notes the
manuscript variant सु॒गा॒तु॒ऽया, and also refers to the Padapāṭha of the RV for this
alternative division. This may also be a possible influence from the RV tradi-
tion on some AV reciters.
Referring to sumnayā́ in AV 7.55.1, Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p.
425\) remarks: “The construction seems so decidedly to call for a locative in c
that sumnayā́ \(p. sumna-yā́, by Prāt. iv. 30 = CA 4.1.52\) is rendered as if it
were for -yāú, from -yú; the comm. glosses it with sumne sukhe.”
Looking at the verse cited in the commentary, it seems that this rule rep-
resents a practice which was instituted by Śākaṭāyana. The rule makes no ref-
erence to Śākaṭāyana, but the commentary makes this clear. This is somewhat
similar to CA 1.1.10, cf. Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary on CA 1.1.10.

in the commentary to Prāt. iv.32 \[= CA 4.1.54\]\) is the same with the usual

explains it by abhigantavyeṣu, adj. to uktheṣu.”
For an identically worded rule, see APR \(218b: सौ च\). However, like

Note: See the Notes on the preceding two rules for comparison with
the APR. Whitney points out: “No case ending is separable after a long final
vowel, whether this be an original long final of the theme, or the result of a
prolongation according to the rules of declension.” This prohibition is there,
perhaps, because it is difficult to tell immediately whether the long vowel is an
original one or lengthened before the affix. Thus, it fits the notion of sandeha
‘confusion, lack of clarity’ as a reason for not separating parts of a word, cf.
CA \(4.2.5: षोडशी सन्देहात्\).

Note: About the verses cited in the commentary, Whitney remarks:
“The meaning of some of these lines is very clear, and they are seen to cover
the ground of our present rule and of the two following : others are obscure,
and need emendation before they can be intelligently rendered.” However,
now we can indeed make better sense of these verses. They provide further
insights into how some of these derivations were viewed by this tradition. 
The form cakr̥-vā́n did not pose a major problem because the base cakr̥
is viewed as naturally ending in a short vowel. However, the form papi-vā́n
did apparently pose a problem. In this form, this tradition did not believe that
the root ended in i. The element papi- was viewed as being made up of pap

अध्याय ४, पाद १
534
\[from \+pā\] followed by an affix i. This affix i is identified in the verses with
the affixes Ki or KiN prescribed by P.3.2.171 \(आदृगमहनजनः किकिनौ लिट् च\),
which yields forms like papi, dadi, jagmi. The cited verse says that the affix
vasU is added to pap-i, to express no additional meaning, but that of the base
\(svārthe\), to yield pap-i-vas, cf. P.3.2.107 \(क्वसुश्च\). The KV on this rule offers
the examples jakṣivān and papivān. By the convention बहुलं छन्दसि \(= e.g.
P.3.2.88\), which says that grammatical rules apply diversely in Vedic texts,
the two kr̥t affixes i and vasU are compounded into ivasU, cf. वा तयोः कृतोः
समासश्चोपजायेत तत्वतः. Thus, the vowel i in pap\+ivas occurs at the beginning of
the pada, i.e. ivas, rather than at the end of the preceding base, and yet in this
exceptional case, an avagraha has been prescribed after i of ivas, cf. अपदेऽवग्रहः
शिष्टः इकारेण पदादिना. 
We should note that the standard Pāṇinian tradition derives the forms
jakṣivān and papivān differently from the process outlined here in these verses,
cf. Nyāsa on KV on P.3.2.107: जक्षिवानिति । ‘लिट्यन्यतरस्याम्’ \(पा.२.४.४०\) इत्य-
देर्घस्लादेशः, ‘वस्वेकाजाद्घसाम्’ \(पा.७.२.६७\) इतीट्, ‘घसिभसोर्हलि च’ \(पा.६.४.१००\)
इत्युपधालोपः, ... पपिवानिति । पा पाने । पूर्ववदिट् । ‘आतो लोप इटि च’ \(पा.६.४.६४\)
इत्याकारलोपः. The important point to note is that the Pāṇinian tradition does not
view these formations as containing Ki or KiN followed by vasU, but as
formations with the affix KvasU, with an initial augment iṬ. 
The line उपसर्गसमासेऽपि वसावेवावगृह्यते teaches the same rule as CA
\(4.1.58\).
The line अवकारे पदत्वं न पूर्वेणैवावगृह्यते teaches the same rule as CA
\(4.1.59\).
The final verse seems to relate to those forms where vas is preceded by
a long vowel \(ahrasva\), such as jigīvā́n \(AV 4.22.6\), which is not split in the
Padapāṭha. The last line seems to refer to the fact that the Padapāṭha form
jigīvā́n appears as jigīvā̃́ in the Saṃhitāpāṭha through the irregular Vedic
\(छान्दसत्वात्\) change of the final n to rU \(रुत्वम्\) \[rU > y > Ø\], with the con-
comitant nasalization of the preceding vowel, cf. P.8.3.7 \(नश्छव्यप्रशान्\), P.8.3.8
\(उभयथर्क्षु\), and P.8.3.2 \(अत्रानुनासिकः पूर्वस्य तु वा\).
Note that CA \(4.1.57\) uses the expression vasu-, where the final u is a
marker sound, similar to Pāṇinian usage. Such markers are, however, nowhere
defined in the CA. The verses cited by the commentary show a thorough fa-
miliarity with the Pāṇinian system. They use the Pāṇinian expressions Ki-
Kinau and rU.

Note: Whitney says: “That is to say, when the suffix is contracted
into uṣ, in the weak forms of declension, it is no longer separable, and the ava-
graha remains where it was before, between the preposition and the verb.”
This rule is also stated in the verse cited in the CAB on CA \(4.1.57\): अवकारे
पदत्वं न पूर्वेणैवावगृह्यते. The verse cited in the CAB on the present rule is ren-

अध्याय ४, पाद १
536
dered by Whitney as: “when the suffix suffers contraction, its capability of
standing as an independent pada is not taught : the former constituent then
maintains the avagraha, as having a superior right to it \(?\).” The word
prasāraṇa in the verse is identical with samprasāraṇa of Pāṇini 1.1.45 \(इग्यणः
सम्प्रसारणम्\), and is better translated as ‘expansion \[e.g. of v into u\],’ rather than
as ‘contraction.’
It should also be noted that there is no avagraha in forms like
ábibhyuṣīḥ \(AV 3.14.3\) and babhūvúṣī \(AV 9.10.21\), because in these forms
too the original affix vas changes to us. The form babhūvúṣī is especially in-
teresting, because, here seemingly there is an affixal element vúṣī, beginning
with v. We do not know exactly how the Prātiśākhya tradition conceptualized
the derivation of such a form. However, Pāṇini prescribes an end-augment
vUK to the root, cf. P.6.4.88 \(भुवो वुग्लुङ्लिटोः\), giving us the division babhūv\+
úṣī, leaving the affix as a non-v-initial form of the original vasU.
४.१.६०. समन्तः पूरणे ।
Whitney \(4.38\). I: 80.
Translation: The word samanta, \[only\] in the sense of ‘full,’
\[is split with an avagraha in the Padapāṭha\].

\(पद, अ.वे. ४.३४.५\)।
Note: Whitney faults the commentator for making pseudo-semantic
distinctions between the two uses of the word samanta. He translates the word
pūraṇa as ‘completion’ and sarvataḥ as ‘wholly.’ Thus translated, the mean-
ings are indeed not sufficiently distinct. However, pūraṇa rather refers to being
full, endowed with everything. On the other hand, the expression sarvataḥ
refers to ‘on all sides.’ This is the distinction intended by the commentator,

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका537
and it is a valid distinction. Sāyaṇa, on AV \(6.8.1\), paraphrases the word
samantam with sarvataḥ, while, on AV \(7.81.4\), he paraphrases the same word
with sampūrṇa. 
The passage समन्तः सर्वतोऽर्थेऽन्तोदात्तं नावगृह्यते, आद्युदात्तमवगृह्यते पूरणार्थे is
comparable to APR \(p. 157\).

अ.वे. ६.६४.३\)।
Note: Whitney remarks: “We should have expected this rule to be
stated the other way; namely, that the root an was not separated from pra and
apa \(in the compounds prāṇa and apāna, which are always thus written in pada,
without division\). This would, one the one hand, be theoretically preferable,
since the general rules for division would lead us to expect the pada readings
pra-āna, apa-āna, vi-āna, and sam-āna, and we therefore ought to have the first
two denied, rather than the last two ratified, by a special rule : and, on the hand,
it would be practically more accurate, since udāna, which occurs in the combi-
nation vyāna-udānau, is doubtless a separable compound, and is in fact so re-
garded by the commentator, under rule 42 \(= CA 4.1.64\) below. Why prāṇa
and apāna should not also be divided, it is far from easy to see.”

अध्याय ४, पाद १
538
Note that the AV form is prāṇati corresponding to the RV and the
Classical form prāṇiti. This justifies the wording of this rule, e.g. anatau. The
reading anitau found in the manuscript I is either under the influence of the
R̥gvedic tradition or an unconscious classicalization. Also see: CA \(4.2.11:
प्राणति प्राणन्ति\). The discussion in the commentary that the word vyānaḥ is sepa-
rated in the pada-text with an avagraha, but the words prāṇa and apāna are not
so separated matches with what we find in the mss. of the Padapāṭha. How-
ever, it is not immediately clear why such should be the case. One possibility
is that the divisions of these two words were easily perceived in a natural pro-
nunciation of vyāna as vi\(y\)āna and of samāna as sam āna. On the other hand,
no such natural separation was possible in the pronunciation of the words
prāṇa and apāna. This seems to have been the explanation offered by the APR
\(p.135: प्राणोऽपानति वेदितः प्रापाभ्यां दीर्घसंशयात्\). If one is to venture an explana-
tion beyond this statement, one could say that such a state of affairs reflects a
very early phase in the development of ideas about sandhi, and the Padakāras
have shied away from those cases of possible segmentation which might have
involved what the CA calls sandeha, cf. CA \(4.2.5: षोडशी सन्देहात्\). The word
sandeha obviously have both the meanings, fusion and confusion\!
Some examples of the CAB are found in APR \(p. 157\). Also compare
the formulation of APR \(217f, p. 157\):
समानमस्मिन्को देव \(अ.वे. १०.२.१३\) इत्येतदेवावगृह्यते ।

Whitney \(4.40\). A, B, D: °म्यांम्रे°. J, M, P: कम्यांम्रे°.
Translation: \[There is separation with an avagraha in the

word.

भूयः । श्वःऽश्वः॑’ \(पद, अ.वे. १०.६.५\)।
Note: It is clear that the author of the Padapāṭha separates kāmyā with
an Avagraha. While Pāṇini treats this as a case of affixation \(e.g. kāmyaC \), cf.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका539
P.3.1.9 \(काम्यच्च\), the CA treats this as a case of an affix being compounded
with its base. Whitney remarks: “This is a strange rule. In the first place, the
Atharva-Veda furnishes no ground whatever for the treatment of kāmya as a
suffix, even though it be regarded as such in certain combinations in the gen-
eral grammatical system \(see Pāṇ. iii.1.9 etc.\). We find it only in such com-
pounds as the commentator instances, which would fall under rule 9 of this
chapter \(= CA 4.1.31\) without occasioning any difficulty or hesitation. In the
second place, I can discover no possible reason for combining together in one
rule things so utterly unconnected and incongruous as the occurrence of this
suffix and that of words repeated in an emphatic or a distinctive sense. The
dual termination, however, is our warrant that we have not here, as in the case
of rules 12 and 13 of the first chapter \(= CA 1.1.14-15\), two rules written and
explained together by the commentator.”
It may be observed that CA \(4.1.31: समासे च\) seems to refer to combi-
nations which are traditionally considered to be samāsa ‘compounds’ by the
systems of general grammar. However, the CA considers many cases of af-
fixation as cases of compounding, since the members are so separated with an
avagraha in the Padapāṭha. One may assume that traditions of general gram-
mar, such as reflected in Pāṇini’s grammar, had already classified kāmya as an
affix, and the CA was simply responding to such a classification by including
it here as a case of affixal compound.
As for the āmreḍita ‘repeated word,’ the CAB on CA \(2.3.2\) uses the
term āmreḍita-samāsa to refer to paraḥparaḥ in AV \(12.3.39\). The CA inclu-
sion of āmreḍita here indicates a concern that this is not considered to be a
compound \(samāsa\) by the traditional general grammars of Sanskrit, and hence
needs to be included explicitly. K.V. Abhyankar in his own recent work on
the Padapāṭha formulates a rule: द्विर्वचनवृत्तौ समासवदवग्रहः, \(Abhyankar, 1974, p.
19\). Note here the expression samāsavat, which suggests a similar hesitation
about using the term samāsa to refer to such a phenomenon. Abhyankar brings
it under a wider category of vr̥tti, which may be translated as ‘composition,’ to
distinguish it from a narrower notion of compound. See my note on CA
\(2.3.2\). Also see George Cardona, “Āmreḍita compounds?,” appearing in
Professor Paul Thieme Festschrift.

‘सा॒ला॒वृ॒कान्ऽइ॑व’ \(पद, अ.वे. २.२७.५\)।
Note: It is clear that the CA suspected that the combination of iva
with the preceding word may not be included in the traditional notion of com-
pound, and hence needed to be mentioned separately. Pāṇini had clearly not
intended this to be a compound. However, under the pressure of the
Prātiśākhya tradition, Kātyāyana suggests that compounding with iva be ac-
cepted by the grammarians, cf. Vārttika: इवेन विभक्तयलोपः पूर्वपदप्रकृतिस्वरत्वं च, on
P.2.1.4 \(सह सुपा\)i this Vārttika explicitly uses the term samāsa:
इवेन सह समासो विभक्तयलोपः पूर्वपदप्रकृतिस्वरत्वं च वक्तव्यम्, MB, \(Kielhorn edn.,
Vol. I., p. 378\). Here, the word vaktavyam is significant in that it indicates that
this is a new prescription, not available from Pāṇini’s rules.

Whitney \(4.42\). B, D: °ध्येमेन. C, J, M, P: °मध्येन. O: °थोवावगृ°. P: no
daṇḍa after this rule.
Translation: The separation \[with an avagraha in the
Padapāṭha is effected at the juncture\] in between two separable
\[compound-expressions, when they are further joined to form a
new compound\].
Note: For example, āñjana is separable as ā-añjana and abhyañjana is
separable as abhi-añjana. When these two are further compounded, their new
joint is separated in the Padapāṭha with an avagraha. This shows a great
awareness of the derivational history of a larger compound, and shows that
compounding is not simply a flatland concatenation of disparate items, but a
step-by-step process.
Whitney criticizes the formulation of this rule: “The Vāj. Pr. finds no
need of such a rule as this, nor does it seem imperatively called for, all possible
cases being already disposed of by rules 10 and 12 above \(CA 4.1.32, 34\).
Still less is to be seen the necessity of adding to it the two which next follow,
and which it obviously includes.”
While CA \(4.1.32, 34\) deal with a new accretion to a previously com-
pounded unit, the present rule deals with a second level combination of two
independent compound-expressions, and hence has a somewhat different sub-
ject matter. Secondly, the formulation of the next two rules indicates that not

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका541
all combinations were easily categorized as samāsas, and hence had to be listed
separately. Not all avagr̥hyas were readily categorized as compounds. It indi-
cates a historically important dimension of the term samāsa, namely that it had
originally a narrower meaning, and that its scope was slowly widened in some
traditions. The CA shows the transitional phase where there is still some
hesitation about the exact scope of the term, and hence the need for specific
rules. On the other hand, the verses cited in the CAB on CA \(4.1.66\) seem to
take the expanded meaning of term samāsa for granted and hence lump all the
examples together under a single category of pr̥thak-iṅgya-samāsa. This is not
done either by the CA or by the CAB. Thus, the cited verses seem to mark a
further movement of the grammatical generalization.

Note: Whitney says: “It is not without reason that the Prātiśākhya
takes note of these cases; for, since the suffixes tara and tama are separable \(by
iv. 16 = CA 4.1.38\), and are plainly the last added members, the words they
form should read, in pada, vasudhā-tara and sahasrasā-tama.” 
Whitney understands the commentary as offering the first alternative
that the word vasudhā́taraḥ as “the plural of vasu-dhātar.” If indeed such were
the case, there would be nothing exceptional about the separation of this com-
pound as vasu-dhātaraḥ. Whitney responds to this interpretation: “It would be,
in fact, in its Atharvan connection, much more easily interpretable in this man-
ner, but that the accent speaks strongly for the other mode of derivation.” It is,
however, not certain from the wording of the commentary that it is proposing a
derivation from vasudhātr̥-. The commentary simply says that it is a genitive
compound. However, the cited verse relates this notion of a genitive com-
pound with the explanation: dhā\+taraḥ, then vasūnaṃ dhā\+taraḥ.
The commentary gives as the second alternative, the derivation
vasudhā\+tara. The first part vasudhā is explained as vasūni vā dadhāti, an
agentive root-noun.
Whitney was not able to interpret the verse properly, since he mis-
understood it as saying “after sā and dhā \(?\), as kr̥t -endings.” The verse says
that the words sā and dhā are kr̥dantas, i.e. these words end in kr̥t-affixes, and
not that they are themselves kr̥t endings. Then the taddhita affixes -tara and -
tama are added after these kr̥danta formations, yielding dhātaraḥ and sātamaḥ.
The words vasu and sahasra are then compounded with these in genitive Tat-
puruṣas. The tradition thus looks at the words dhā and sā as agentive root-
nouns, with zero-affixes such as VIC or VIṬ, which turn a root into an agen-

would be similar.
For AV \(3.28.4\), Whitney records a different accent for the word स॒हस्र॑-
सातमा. This variant is noted by the VVRI edition, but I have followed the
reading as recorded by the VVRI edition. Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p. 135\)
says: “All the manuscripts agree in giving the false accent sahásrasātamā in b; it
should be sahasra-sā́tamā --- or to rectify the meter, simply -sā́.” The VVRI
edition, without specifying the reason, seems to have followed Whitney’s sug-
gested change in giving the reading sahasrasā́tamā, though it notes the original
manuscript reading \(= mūlakośa\) sahásra-sātamā as a variant.
४.१.६८. सुभिषक्तमस्तमे ।
Whitney \(4.46\). E, F, I, O: °क्तमे.
Translation: \[In the expression\] subhiṣaktama, \[there is
separation with an avagraha in the Padapāṭha\] before \[the affix\]
-tama.

\(source?\)
Note: Whitney translates the cited verse as: “here su is compounded
with the masculine bhiṣaj, and tama is farther appended : separation by ava-
graha is made of the latter.” 
Whitney criticizes the formulation of this rule: “I can see no reason at
all for any such rule as this : the case specified is simply one in which the sepa-
ration by avagraha takes place normally, according to the general rules, and a
score more of precisely similar cases might easily be quoted from the Atharvan
text: instances are bhágavat-tama \(ii.9.2\) and bhágavat-tara \(iv.13.6\), sphātimat-
tama \(iii.24.6\), mr̥támanaḥ-tara \(vi.18.2\), and vr̥trahán-tama \(vii.110.1\).”

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका545
Whitney’s criticism is not justified in view of the fact that the expres-
sion bhiṣák-tarāḥ, without the initial su, is attested in AV \(19.2.3\), leading one
to think of the possibility of first having the expression bhiṣak-tama and then
compounding it with su. In such a case, the juncture of su with bhiṣaktama
being the most recent juncture, the avagraha would fall between su and
bhiṣaktama. 
Such an understanding of this compound is further strengthened by the
fact that the expression bhiṣáktamam without su also appears in bhiṣáktamaṃ
tvā bhiṣájāṃ śr̥ṇomi \(RV 2.33.4\), which is comparable to bhiṣájāṃ súbhiṣak-
tamāḥ \(AV 6In contrast with this, the expression subhiṣaj by itself is
not attested in the Vedic Saṃhitās.
The CA rule is most likely based on such an understanding of the com-
pound, and then stating the exceptional behavior of the avagraha. On the other
hand, the cited verse normalizes the avagraha by suggesting that su is com-
pounded with bhiṣak, and that tama is added to subhiṣak. On such an under-
standing of the derivation, the avagraha becomes normal, and does not require
a special rule.

the difference between the number of rules for this Pāda given by H \(47\), I

initial verses, and the one without. However, the majority of the manuscripts
supports inclusion of these verses in the text of the CA. One may conjecture
that the inclusion of the verses was explicitly done first by the manuscripts of
the Kautsavyākaraṇa, as evidenced by the number of rules recorded in I and O.
However, the verses are physically present in all the manuscripts, even though
not counted in the number of rules, cf. H \(47\). Thus, they must have been pre-
sent in the archetype reconstructible on the basis of the existing manuscripts.
However, given the abnormal length of this Pāda, it seems unlikely that the ini-
tial portion was part of the ‘original’ CA.

Note: While the commentary does not provide counter-examples,
Whitney provides them: āsan-vat \(AV vi.12.2\), asthan-vantam \(AV ix.9.4\),
and brahmaṇ-vatīm \(AV vi.108.2\). These expressions are split with an ava-
graha in the Padapāṭha. Whitney points out: “The only consonants other than t
and s which are found to occur before the suffix vant are n and ṇ, which allow
separation. ... The rule is an exception under rule 17 \(= CA 4.1.39\) above.” It
is also an exception to CA \(4.1.40\).
The expression matvartha implies that matU was looked as a proto-
typical possessive affix. Indeed, the possessive affix vat is derived by Pāṇini
by changing the m of matUP, cf. P.8.2.9 \(मादुपधायाश्च मतोर्वोऽयवादिभ्यः\).

Translation: After yat, tat, and etat, \[there is no separation
with an avagraha in the Padapāṭha\], before vatU.
Note: While prohibiting the separation of vat, the rule informs us that
forms like yāvat are derived by adding the affix vat to yat etc., cf. P.5.2.39
\(यत्तदेतेभ्यः परिमाणे वतुप्\). This rule is an exception to CA \(4.1.40\). Pāṇini
6.3.91 \(आ सर्वनाम्नः\) prescribes the replacement of the final sound of a pronoun
with ā before the affixes dr̥k, dr̥ś, and vatU, e.g. yad\+vat > ya\+ā\+vat > yāvat.
However, there were other grammarians who prescribed the affix ḌāvatU,
which led to the deletion of the final portion of the pronoun beginning with the
final vowel, yad\+ḌāvatU > y\+ḌāvatU > y\+āvat > yāvat, cf. Vārttika :
डावतावर्थवैशेष्यात् ..., on P.5.2.39. Referring to this Vārttika, the Tattvabodhinī
points out: इह शास्त्रे वतुपं विधाय तस्मिन् परे आत्वं विहितम् । पूर्वाचार्यास्तु डावतुं
विदधिरे, on SK on P.5.2.39, p. 298. The CA procedure is more like that of
Pāṇini.

Referring to the counter-examples cited by the CAB, Whitney remarks
that these are “hardly called for.” I assume Whitney means that the rule is so
obvious, there is no need for counter-examples, and not that there is anything

Note: Referring to the cited verses, Whitney says: “A number of
verses follow in the commentary, in the usual corrupt condition of the text :
devatānām iha dvandve dīrghatvaṃ yati dr̥śyate : aniṅgyaṃ tat padaṃ vācyam
agnīṣomau nidarśanam : thus much is clear, and is a virtual repetition of our
rule, but with a restriction to cases in which a long vowel appears at the end of
the first member of the compound, which requires a specification farther on of
the single exception indravāyū; what follows is more obscure, and I have not
been able, with what time I have given to it, to restore the text to an intelligible
form.” I think we can now make better sense of most, if not all, of these
verses.
The second verse says that, if, as stated in the first verse, a deva-
tādvandva that has a long vowel is not divisible, then how come the compound
devāsurā́ḥ \(AV 6.141.3\) is divisible in the Padapāṭha as deva-asurā́ḥ? Here, the
long vowel is due to the merger of the two words, and not due to lengthening
of the final vowel of deva. This is similar to the compound satyānr̥té \(AV
1.33.2\), which is divisible in the Padapāṭha as satya-anr̥té. 
On the face of it, the line discussing the expression bráhma prajā́patiḥ
\(AV 19.9.12\) is unclear. It seems to say that this is never separated. How-
ever, the available Padapāṭha reads: bráhma / prajā́-patiḥ. However, note that
Kātyāyana in his Vārttika : ब्रह्मप्रजापत्यादीनां च on P.6.3.25 \(आनङ् ऋतो द्वन्द्वे\) says
that in the dvandva compound brahmaprajāpatī, one does not have ānAṄ for
the final vowel of the first member. Thus expression आनङः प्रतिषेधः च in our
verses is not difficult to comprehend. The present verse seems to say that in a
compound like brahmaprajāpatī, there is no separation. The dvandva com-
pound brahmaprajāpatī́ is not attested in AV. It is, however, attested in the
Taittirīya-Āraṇyaka \(4.1.1\).
The line वायोश्चोभयतः परम् is comparable to Kātyāyana’s Vt. देवताद्वन्द्वे
उभयत्र वायोः प्रतिषेधः on P.6.3.26 \(देवताद्वन्द्वे च\), which says that neither is the
word vāyu as a first member of a devatādvandva lengthened, nor is another
word, before vāyu is lengthened, e.g. vāyvagnī, agnivāyū. The AV example of

अध्याय ४, पाद २
550
this phenomenon is indravāyū́ \(AV 3.20.6\) which is not divided in the
Padapāṭha, even though there is no lengthening.
The last verse is somewhat unclear. It seems to be saying that this pro-
hibition of avagraha should apply to all dvandvas, and an example of this
would be ahorātre \(AV 6.128.3\). See CA \(4.2.6\) below.
In view of the fact that CA \(4.2.4\) below specifically relates to those
dvandvas where the first member has its final vowel lengthened, the proper
examples for the present rule can only be compounds like indravāyū́ \(AV 3.20.
6\), where we do not have lengthening of the final vowel of the first member.

Note: Examples cited by the CAB on this rule are found listed under
APR \(217, pp. 136-7\) in the same order. 
This rule and the commentary on this rule answer some of the ques-
tions raised in the verses cited in the commentary on the previous rule. The
condition vyañjanādau excludes the compound satyānr̥té from being indivisi-
ble. Here, the second member, i.e. anr̥ta begins in a vowel, and the lengthening

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका551
in satyā- comes about through euphonic combination -a\+a-, rather than as
lengthening of the final vowel of the first member, before the second member.
The verses cited in the commentary on the previous rule also bring up the ex-
ample devāsurā́ḥ \(AV 6.141.3\).
As far as the verse cited in the commentary on this rule, Whitney has
justifiable criticisms. He renders the verse as: “After irā, amīvā, and puraḥ
\[avagraha comes in\], for in those cases the vowel is long by nature; but where
a short vowel is lengthened, there no division by avagraha takes place.” Then,
he remarks: “This is a very blundering statement, so far as concerns the in-
stances given in the first pāda: puraḥ, of course, could form no copulative
compound; amīva forms none such in the Atharvan, and it also, though a femi-
nine with a long final vowel, as a separate word, always shortens its final in
composition \(amīva-cātana, e.g. i.28.1; amīva-han, e.g. RV. i.18.2\); irā, too, is
found only in the compound irā-kṣīrā \(x.10.6\), which is not copulative.”
Of the three words cited by the verse, for amīvā, there is a plausible ex-
ample from the Paippalāda AV \(1.10.1\): amīvāyātucātanam. A variant for this
is cited as amīvāyās tu cātanam. However, if we accept the reading
amīvā\+yātu\+cātanam, then the first portion, i.e. amīvā\+yātu could be a kind of
dvandva referred to by the verse. This reading is rejected by Vishvabandhu, in
favor of amīvāyās tu cātanam, cf. VVRI Vedic Word Concordance, Saṃhitā
Section, Pt.I., p.385, footnote e. However, considering the reference to yātu in
the same hymn, PAV \(1.10.3\), there is some reason to support the reading
amīvā\+yātu\+cātanam.
For iḍā in the verse, one could possibly point to the compound
iḍā\+prāśitrá \(ŚB, 2.6.1.33\).

Note: Whitney has some important comments on this rule. We agree
with his opinion “that the rule reads ṣoḍaśī in stead of ṣoḍaśa is surprising,
since both words \(each in but a single passage\) occur in the text.” On the
statement of the rule that the word ṣoḍaśī is not split because of sandeha, which
Whitney translates as ‘interfusion,’ he comments: “Or, it may be, ‘on account
of doubt’- that is to say, of doubt as to the form to which the constituents
should be restored, their mode of combination being an entirely anomalous
one. It is to be observed, however, that our treatise has itself \(at i.63 = CA
1.3.1\) given special directions as to how ṣaṭ and the following daśa are com-
bined together, so that to the student of the Prātiśākhya the pada-reading śaṭ-
daśa ought to occasion no difficulty.” Whitney has pointed his finger at a very
important dilemma. In stead of saying that there is behavioral contradiction,
however, one may understand the situation somewhat differently. It is difficult
to say that the rules given in this or any other Prātiśākhya were actually the
ones followed by the creators of the Padapāṭhas. The Prātiśākhyas, on the
other hand, seem to take the existence of the Padapāṭha for granted, and then
try to account for it. This being the case, the author of the Prātiśākhya was ob-
ligated to observe that the word ṣoḍaśī was not divided in the Padapāṭha, and
the expression sandehāt refers to his own rationalization as to why the Pada-
pāṭha did not divide this word. On the other hand, the rule CA 1.3.1 is almost
a rule of word-derivation, showing the leanings of the author of the Prāti-
śākhya in the direction of general grammatical theory. Whitney himself has
given ample proof of such leanings on the part of this text, which go well
beyond the narrow scope of a Prātiśākhya.
The notion of sandeha as a cause for non-separation is also found in
APR \(217a, p. 134\): सन्देहाद्वर्णलोपाच्च व्यत्ययान्नावगृह्यते. The examples of this rule
are also found in APR \(p.137\). Also cf. VPR \(5.34: पाङ्त्रानुद्द्रोऽब्भ्राय संशयात्\)
and \(5.38: उत्तम्भनादीन्यादिसंशयात्\).
४.२.६. अहोरात्रे ।
Whitney \(4.52\). P adds a daṇḍa after this rule as a correction.
Translation: \[There is no separation of members with an
avagraha in the Padapāṭha in the word\] ahorātra.

‘अ॒हो॒रा॒त्रे \[इति॑\]। इ॒दम् । ब्रू॒मः॒’ \(पद, अ.वे. ११.६.५\)।
Note: Whitney says: “There is nothing in the character of either
ahorātre or ṣoḍaśa, so far as I can discover, which should withdraw them from
the action of rule 50 \(= CA 4.2.4\), and render their separate mention neces-
sary.” I feel that Whitney is overlooking here the reason sandehāt given by the
author of the Prātiśākhya in CA 4.2.5, which most likely continues into this
rule. As I see, these are irregular changes. The change of ṣaṭ \+ daśa to ṣoḍaśa
is irregular by all counts. Similarly, the behavior of the first member in the
compound ahorātre is equally irregular, and hence the confusion. The stem
form is ahan, which changes to ahar, and, especially in this compound, behaves
like ahas. Thus, these cases are indeed more complicated than the cases listed
under CA 4.2.4, where we have nothing more than simple lengthening of the
final vowel of the first member of the compound.
We should note another curious fact. While the APR \(217, p. 137\) lists
ahorātré among its examples of indivisible words, it does not list ahorātrā́-
bhyāṃ. On the other hand, it lists both ṣoḍaśam and ṣoḍaśī. This makes one
wonder whether the expression ahorātrā́bhyām was intended as an indivisible
word. However, no editions record any variants.

Note: Consider Whitney’s criticism of the commentary: “The com-
mentator ends with a verse which seems to say precisely the opposite of the
rule of his text. ... ‘when both members are severally separable, both the newly
added and the ancient, separation by avagraha is to be made of the ancient one:
an instance is r̥k-sāmābhyām.’ But this is mere non-sense, as it stands, the
word cited being a case where the last-appended element is inseparable, as
following a long vowel \(see rule 33 = CA 4.1.55, above\), and where, there-
fore, the division be suffered to remain between the two original constituents of
the compound. If the theme of the declension had been r̥k-sāman, instead of
r̥ksāma, we should have an instrumental dual r̥ksāma-bhyām, which would be
a true illustration of the rule. One may conjecture that the last line originally
read jare nāvagrahaḥ kārya r̥ksāmabhyāṃ nidarśanam, and that it was amended
to its present form by some copyist who knew that the Atharvan read, not
r̥ksāma-bhyām, but r̥k-sāmābhyām, but who was careless enough to overlook
the discordance which he thus introduced between the text and its comment.” 
I do agree with Whitney that there is discord between the rule and the
verse as it stands. However, Whitney’s emendation of the verse and his attrib-
uting to the copyist so much of the initiative do not seem appropriate. Perhaps,
we do not fully understand the meaning of the expression pratividhye te or
pratividhyete in the cited verse. In my view, it is most likely that this is a mis-
take for an original pratiṣidhyete. Assuming this to be the reading, the verse
would mean: “Where the separation is prohibited for both the old and the new
members, the separation should be carried out with the old member, for exam-
ple in r̥k-sāmābhyām.” Here, the avagraha is prohibited before -bhyām, be-
cause it is preceded by a long vowel, and it is prohibited between r̥k and
sāmābhyām, because it is an old joint. In such a case, the verse says that the
avagraha should be done between the old-members. Such an understanding
removes the dilemma posed by this verse for Whitney.
The first three examples quoted on this rule by the CAB to illustrate the
formations with the root añc are found listed under APR \(217, p. 136\).

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका555
४.२.८. समुद्रादिषु च ।
Whitney \(4.54\). C: omits च.
Translation: \[No separation of members with an avagraha in
the Padapāṭha occurs\] in the words such as samudra.
चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - समुद्रादिषु च ...\(missing commen-
tary\)।
Note: The missing commentary is clearly due to the carelessness of
the copyist. However, Whitney unjustly criticizes the commentator: “This,
however, gives us reason to believe that the commentator had performed his
work in his usual brief and unsatisfactory style, and had done very little toward
filling up the gaṇa.” I do not see how the copyist’s carelessness can give rea-
son to believe such a thing. 
Invaluable help is offered by the fact that the samudrādigaṇa is fully
listed in the APR \(217c, examples 59ff.\). This is a list of words whose seem-
ing parts should not be separated in the Padapāṭha. Given the close relation-
ship between the CAB and the APR, there is every reason to believe that the
commentator would have cited the first few words from the APR list. For a
possible reference to the samudrādigaṇa in the CAB, see CA \(4.1.38\). 
We must, however, keep in mind that the membership of the sa-
mudrādigaṇa as intended by the CA must have been somewhat smaller as
compared to the list found in the APR, because a large number of cases of in-
divisible expressions listed by the APR in the samudrādigaṇa are taken care of
by the CA with specific rules, cf. CA \(4.2.1-7\).
Since Whitney had no access to the APR edited by Surya Kanta, he
made a determined effort on his own to fill out this gaṇa. However, now we
have a historically more authentic collection in the APR and we need not dwell
upon Whitney’s collection, except as a reflection of what one finds in the
manuscripts of the AV.

Note: The CA uses the term vr̥ddha without defining it. Pāṇini de-
fines this term as P.1.1.73 \(वृद्धिर्यस्याचामादिस्तद्वृद्धम्\). Something similar is in-
tended by the CA. Referring to the example airā-vatáḥ \(AV 8.10.29\), Whitney
\(AV Transl. Vol.II., p. 515\) says: “Āirā-vatáḥ is quoted under Prāt. iv.55 \(=

its secondary formation with initial vr̥ddhi.”
All the positive examples of the CAB are found under APR \(219, pp.

Note: Whitney criticizes the formulation of this rule as follows: “The
form of statement which our treatise has adopted for its rule respecting the
separability of negative compounds is not particularly well chosen.” However,
compare the CA rule to APR \(220, p.166\):
एकाक्षरमवर्णान्तं यद्भवेन्नञ उत्तरम् ।
तत्पदं नावगृह्णीयादप्रयावादिवर्जितम् ॥

अध्याय ४, पाद २
558
The verse cited by the CAB is clearly a mutilated version of APR
\(220\). The APR \(220\) itself, in Surya Kanta’s edition reads b: यद्भवेन्नय उत्तरम्,
which I have emended to यद्भवेन्नञ उत्तरम्. We should also note that all the posi-
tive examples of this rule offered by the CAB including the unattested aprajātāḥ
are the first few examples of a long list of examples offered by the APR. The
APR \(p. 167\) also illustrates the condition aprayāvādivarjitam with the exam-
ples ápra-yāvam \(AV 3.5.1\) and ápra-yucchan \(AV 2.6.3\). Whitney also
draws our attention to the form ápra-yucchan.
Regarding the indivisible example ásabandhuḥ \(AV 6.15.2\), Whitney
points out that this word in its occurrence in AV \(6.54.3\) is divided by his
Padapāṭha manuscript as ása-bandhuḥ. Whitney says that this is “probably a
copyist’s error.” The VVRI edition does not even note such a manuscript vari-
ant.
Concerning the form aprayāvan in AV \(3.5.1\), Whitney \(AV Transl.
Vol. I., p. 91\) says: “Áprayāvan in d, which is read by all the mss. \(hence by
both editions\) and the comm. \(= Sāyaṇa\), is unquestionably to be emended to -
yāvam; the word is quoted in the Prāt. text \(iv.56 = CA 4.2.10\), but not in a
way o determine its form \(aprayāvādi-\). ... The commentary raises no objection
to áprayāvan, and explains it as either māṃ vihāyā ’napagantā san \(with
irregular exchange of case-forms\), or else aprayātar, i.e. sarvadā dhāryamāṇa.”
The manuscript H for the CAB clearly reads aprayāvan, and, in his CA edition,
Whitney also reads aprayāvan. For Lanman’s vigorous defense of Whitney’s
emendation to the form áprayāvam, see: AV Transl. Vol.II., p. 991. Whitney’s
emendation to aprayāvam is now supported by the APR \(p. 167\).

Note: Whitney observes: “But the rule is an exceedingly insufficient
exposition of the treatment by the pada-text of the forms of the root an with the
prefix pra. Division is, in fact, omitted only when the verb, and not the prepo-
sition, has the accent; but then not in the two forms specified only, but also in
the participles - as prāṇát \(e.g. x.8.2\), prāṇaté \(xi.4.8\), prāṇatás \(iv.2.2\),
prāṇatā́m \(iii.31.9\), and prāṇatī́nām \(viii.9.9\) -- and in the causative as prāṇáyati
\(xiii.3.3\). On the other hand, if the prefix takes the accent, it is disjoined from
the verb, according to the general usage in such cases, and we read prá : ana
\(iii.31.9\), and prá : anati \(x.8.19, xi.4.14\). If the root is compounded with apa,
also, the same usage is followed, and we have apānaté \(xi.4.8\) and ápa : anati
\(xi.4.14\).” The APR \(pp. 135-6\) takes care of Whitney’s concerns by provid-
ing a much fuller list of finite verb forms and participial forms where the divi-
sion does not take place, and is, on the whole, a more adequate accounting of
the facts of the Atharvan. One way to soften Whitney’s criticism is to say that
the CA rule applies only to those cases, where prá is compounded with the root
an, and not where it remains apart as an independent word, due to the retaining
of its udātta accent. In any case, either the rule should have been more specific,
or there should have been a more adequate listing, as in the APR \(pp. 135-6\).
It should be noted that the AV form is prāṇati, while the corresponding
RV form is prāṇiti. That is also the form found in the Taittirīya-Brāhmaṇa
\(3.12.6.1\). This justifies the wording of the rule: अनतौ विसंभ्यां प्राणाख्या चेत्,
CA \(4.1.61\). For a parallel, see under APR \(217a, p. 135\): प्राणोऽपानति वेदितः

CA \(4.2.5: षोडशी सन्देहात्\).

Note: The VVRI edition notes the manuscript variant सं॒स्कृ॒त॒ऽत्रम्, and

of the influence of the R̥gvedic tradition on the AV tradition. Whitney’s Index
Verborum gives the RV form, which Whitney later admitted was a case of
oversight \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p. 187\). The examples quoted by the CAB are

\! ‘तु॒विऽत॑मः,’ अ.वे. ६.३३.३\)।
Note: Referring to the examples cited by the CAB, Whitney says:
“Their citation under such a precept implies the acceptance of some such ety-
mological theories of their derivation and form as given by the Vāj. Pr. \(iii.49,
51\), which explains taskara and br̥haspati as from tat-kara and br̥hat-pati re-
spectively, with loss of t and insertion of s, and vanaspati as from vana-pati,
with the insertion of s; but it is unnecessary to remark that such explanations
are futile : taskara is obscure, and the other two are without much doubt com-
pounds of pati with the preceding genitive of an obsolete noun, being analo-
gous with bráhmaṇas páti, vācás páti, śubhás páti, etc.; and they would doubt-
less be separated by the pada-text into two independent words, like these, but
for their frequency of occurrence, and, yet more, the irregularity of the accent
of their former members as genitives of a monosyllabic theme.”
We may additionally note that Pāṇini derives these forms in an analo-
gous way, cf. P.6.1.157 \(पारस्करप्रभृतीनि च संज्ञायाम्\), and the gaṇasūtra : तद्बृहतोः

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका561
करपत्योश्चोरदेवतयोः सुट् तलोपश्च. Instead of castigating the Indian grammarians
for not recognizing the ‘obsolete’ genitives, one may recognize that their pro-
cedure of viewing these as s-insertions, marks a similar fact, namely that these
are not synchronically to be treated as genitives. The Padapāṭha, the Prāti-
śākhyas, and Pāṇini, all treat the classical language as the norm, and the Vedic
language as a deviation from that norm, and hence there is great deal to be
learned from their works about the synchronic perception of language.
The Padapāṭha for RV \(1.186.6\) reads तु॒विःऽत॑मः, in contrast with the
AV Padapāṭha reading तु॒विऽत॑मः, suggesting that that tradition did not view the
s in the form tuviṣṭamaḥ as an āgama, but that it was simply a normal transfor-
mation of the visarga. The CA rule and the AV Padapāṭha imply a different
intended derivation for the same word. Also see CA \(3.4.28\) which deals with
the same form.
The examples offered by the CAB on the present rule occur in the same
order in the APR \(p. 145\).
४.२.१४. विश्पतिर्विश्पत्नी ।
Whitney \(4.60\).
Translation: \[There is no separation of the components with

Note: These two examples are listed in APR \(p. 145\). The verse
cited by the commentary offers two different derivations for viśpáti, namely
viśvasya patiḥ or viśām patiḥ. Whitney remarks: “The indivisibility of the
compound is doubtless owing to the rarity of the consonantal conjunction śp,
and the embarrassment which would acompany the restoration of the saṃhitā

form from a pada-reading viṭ-pati.” It may perhaps also be the perceived lack
of clarity regarding the derivation of the words, which leads to their indivisi-
bility, cf. VPR \(5.39: विशौजा इत्यन्यायसमासात्\).
Whitney on CA \(4.2.14 = W: 4.60\) mistakenly refers to svaptu viśpatiḥ
as AV \(ix.5.6\). It should read AV \(iv.5.6\).

Note: It is important to note that along with the attested examples
apratīttam and parīttaḥ, the APR \(p. 145\) also cites the unattested examples
prattam and avattam, and this is one of those few occasions when both the
CAB as well as the APR are citing the same unattested examples, indicating a
close relationship between these texts.
Whitney observes: “The difficulty of making out an acceptable analysis
of them for the pada-text is reason enough for their being treated in that text as
indivisibles.” On the forms parītta and avatta cited as indivisible in VPR \(5.45\),
Uvaṭa’s commentary says: तत्र तावत् परीत्तः अवत्तानां सग्धिः एतानि धात्वेकदेश-
लोपान्नावगृह्यन्ते. Uvaṭa cites a verse generalizing the principles for indivisibility:
आदिमध्यान्तलुप्तानि समासान्य\[drop न्य?\]न्यायभाञ्जि च ।
नावगृह्णन्ति कवयः पदान्यागमवन्ति च ॥
The words prattam and avattam are also cited in NR \(2.1\), and Surya
Kanta \(APR, p. 145\) refers us to Skanda’s commentary on NR : लौकिकाश्चात्र
शब्दाः प्रत्तमवत्तमित्यादय उदाहर्तुं प्रक्रान्ताः. This informs us that Yāska was already
possibly aware of these forms being non-Vedic.

‘उत्थि॑तः’ \(पद, अ.वे. ६.४३.२\)।
Note: Whitney notes that the combination of ud \+ han is not attested
in the known AV. Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 39\) takes this as an
indication that the Vulgate is not a genuinely Śaunakīya recension. A more
likely possibility is that the CA rule incorporates considerations of general
grammar. It should be noted that the APR \(pp. 145-6\) quotes all the same ex-
amples as cited by the CAB including the first unattested example uddhataḥ.
This shows that there is a more genuine linkage between these texts and their
transmission.
Whitney makes some important observations: “The pada-text, however,
appears to treat the combinations as inseparable only where there is actual
composition, as in the participles, and as would also be the case if the unac-
cented preposition preceded the accented verb, for we find út : hara in three
passages \(iv.14.7, ix.6.19, xii.3.36\). For sthā with ud, ... it has already been
noticed \(under ii.18 = CA 2.1.18\) that where the preposition would be, by the
general rules of combination, disjoined from the verb, it is actually so dis-
joined, and that the pada accordingly has út : sthuḥ, út : sthāpaya, etc., where
the saṃhitā has útthuḥ, útthāpaya, etc.” This makes it clear that the Padapāṭha
saw no difficulty in separating the members where it thought they were not
compounded, and therefore, we need to make a clear distinction between vigra-

अध्याय ४, पाद २
564
ha and avagraha. The complexities which prevented avagraha, did not always
prevent the vigraha. 
However, Whitney correctly observes: “One would have thought it es-
pecially desirable that the pada-text should separate ut-hr̥ta etc., in order to
mark the forms as coming from the root har, and not from dhar.”

१८.२.३४\)।
Note: The example úddhitāḥ is also listed as an indivisible word in
the APR \(p. 146\).
On uddhitā in AV \(19.42.2\), Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.II., p. 964\)
says: “In b, our pada-mss. have út°hitā, ∀a word-division\# which is contrary to
Prāt. iv. 63 \(= CA 4.2.17\) and to the usage of the AV. hitherto; SPP. reads in
his pada-text úddhitā, and makes no note upon the matter; ∀he had in fact a note
stating that his P.P.2J. also read út°hitā : but, as appears from his ‘Corrections’
to vol. iv., p. 446, his note was disordered in printing;\# the comm. has instead
uddhr̥tā.” The VVRI edition does not split the word in its pada-text, but cites
út-hitā as a manuscript variant.
As an exception to this rule, Whitney mentions the form uddhí \(viii.8.
22\), and says: “our pada-text leaves it undivided, although it does not fall under
this rule, being composed of ud and dhi.” There is a doubtful listing of uddhí
in APR \(p. 145\) as an indivisible word. The VVRI edition does not split this
word in its pada-text. One wonders if this form was listed in the samudrādi-
gaṇa, a list of indivisible words, as conceived by the CA, cf. CA \(4.2.8\).

Note: Concerning the last portion of the commentary, Whitney says:
“Although much corrupted, it is evident that this teaches the same etymology
with that given by the Vāj.Pr. \(at iv.39: yakārākārayor jāspatye pade\): jāspatya
for jāyās-patya.” In the present state of the manuscript, this passage cannot be
restored to its correct original. The verse seems to say that the word jāspatyam
is derived from jāyā\+patyam, with the deletion of yā, and insertion of s. The
other suggested alternative is to replace the word jāyā with jā.
While the CA clearly says that there is no Avagraha for the word jās-
patyam, the VVRI edition for AV \(W: 7.73.10 = VVRI 7.77.10\) reads the
Padapāṭha as जाः॒ऽप॒त्यम्, and notes no manuscript variant, except that it points
out that the Padapāṭha on RV \(5.28.3\) reads: जाः॒प॒त्यम्. Whitney, on this CA
rule, also notes: “This rule and one in the next section \(iv.83\), taken together,
show that the true pada reading recognized by our treatise is jāḥpatyam; our
pada manuscript, however, gives jāḥ-patyam, with avagraha.” In this instance,
it would seem that the manuscripts have deviated from the CA rule, while the
CA rule represents a situation similar to that in the R̥gveda Padapāṭha.
Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p. 439\) remarks: “The Prāt. iv.64 \(= CA 4.2.18\),
83 \(= CA 4.3.11\) prescribes jāḥpatyám as pada-reading in c, but all the pada-
mss. read jāḥ-patyám, divided, and SPP. accordingly gives that form in his
pada-text. The RV. pada reads jāḥpatyám and jā́ḥpátiḥ, but, strangely, jā́ḥ-
patim \(the two latter occurring only once each\).”

Note: Whitney and Roth had chosen manuṣvát in their edition of the
AV. On the present CA rule, Whitney admitted: “It is unfortunate that, the
Atharvan form of the word being thus fully established \[as manuṣyát\], and its
treatment having been prescribed by the Prātiśākhya with so much care, it
should have been altered in the edited text to manuṣvát, even though the latter is
theoretically decidedly the preferable reading, and is presented by the Rig-Veda
in the corresponding passage \(x.110.8\).” Elsewhere, Whitney is even more
emphatic on manuṣyát : \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p. 241\): “All our mss. have
manuṣyát in b ∀and so have all SPP’s authorities\#, and this form is authenti-
cated by Prāt. iv.65 \(= CA 4.2.19\), the comment explaining how it is derived
from manuṣyavat. As being, therefore, the indubitable AV. reading, it should
not have been altered in our edition to -ṣvát, to conform with the four other
texts, even though doubtless a corruption of -ṣvát. ∀SPP. also alters it.\#” With
such clear admissions of error on the part of Whitney, it is unclear why the
VVRI edition still opts for the reading manuṣvat. The reading manuṣvát is
found in RV \(10.110.8\), Mādhyandina Śukla-Yajurveda \(29.33\), and Taittirīya
Brāhmaṇa \(3.6.3.4\). The manuscript I for the CA also has the reading
manuṣvát.
The APR \(p. 148\) also has the reading manuṣyat.

Note: The word tredhā́ is an exception to CA \(4.1.35: तद्धिते धा\). The
example tredhā́ is listed among inseparable words in the APR \(p. 149\).
Concerning the lacuna in the manuscript, Whitney says: “It is impossi-
ble to say, of course, whether a rule or two has not dropped out.” With sixteen

more manuscripts, we know that no rule has been dropped. Only a small por-
tion of the commentary has been missing.

Note: Surya Kanta says that the example jamadagnyātharvaṇa cited
by the CAB is not found in the Vulgate of the AV, and he \(APR, Introduction,
p. 40\) suggests that this may have occurred in the genuine Śaunakīya recension
of the AV, and that the Vulgate is not the genuine Śaunakīya recension. In this
particular case, the lone manuscript actually reads jamadagnyātharvaṃ, which
Whitney amends without notice to jamadagnyātharvaṇa, which is now claimed
by Surya Kanta as possibly belonging to a long-lost genuine Śaunakīya recen-
sion of the AV. The manuscript reading can be best emended to jamadagny-
ādyarthaṃ. Then follows a list of names beginning with Jamadagni. Thus,
this is another case of a ghost word claimed by Surya Kanta as possibly
belonging to the so-called genuine Śaunakīya recension.
Another matter to be noted is that the passage बहुलमिति च वक्तव्यम् and
the following exceptions may indicate either a lapse on the part of the author of
the CA, or a change in the AV traditions. In any case, the AV manuscripts do
seem to follow this statement of exceptions, rather than following a general
prohibition of Avagraha for the proper names suggested by the CA rule. The
examples of divisible names offered by the CAB must have been divisible for

अध्याय ४, पाद २

the APR as well, as the APR does not list them among its list of indivisible
words.
It may be pointed out that at least some of these divisible names also
appear as adjectives, e.g. parāśara : índro yātūnā́m abhavat parāśaráḥ \(AV 8.4.
21\). Here, \[Pseudo\]-Sāyaṇa paraphrases parāśaráḥ as: parāśātayitā.
For a parallel to the doctrine taught in this rule, see APR \(217a\):

Note: The VVRI edition, p. 1129, points out that the word hr̥dayā-
vidham occurring in the Padapāṭha of RV \(1.24.8\) does have an Avagraha.
However, it does not cite any manuscripts of the AV showing this phe-
nomenon. Thus, in this case, the AV tradition has remained unaffected by the
RV tradition. The examples cited by the CAB are found in APR \(p. 146\).
Surya Kanta \(APR, p. 146\) says that the CAB on our rule also cites the exam-
ple śvāvit \(AV 5.13.9\) cited by the APR. But, this is not supported by the
manuscripts of the CAB. However, all the three examples are cited in the CAB
on CA \(3.1.3\).
Whitney observes: “The rule is too broadly stated, and should have
been restricted by him \[= commentator\], as was the preceding one : it is only
when a protracted vowel precedes the root that the compound is left undivided;
and we have, for instance, vi-vyādhin, abhi-vyādhin \(both i.19.1\), and kr̥ta-
vyadhanī \(v.14.9\).”

Note: As Whitney notes, the form of this rule is rather strange, where
apparently a and ī were fused into e, and then combined with sarvanāmnā to
yield sarvanāmnaikārāntena. Whitney proposes to amend the expression to
sarvanāmnekārāntena to stand for sarvanāmnā īkārāntena, since the only forms
attested in the AV is īdr̥k. However, the reading of the rule as it stands is sup-
ported uniformly by all the manuscripts, as well as by the commentary. Also,
Whitney disregards dr̥śi given in Ha and Hb, and opts for dr̥śau found in the
commentary. However, the reading dr̥śi is uniformly supported by the manu-
scripts. For a parallel to this rule, see APR \(217a\). The APR \(p. 135\) cites the
two attested AV examples. 
The reason these forms are indivisible is that the pronoun to which a
form of dr̥ś is compounded undergoes substantial change. For instance, Pāṇini
derives īdr̥śa from idam, by replacing the entire idam with ī, cf. P.6.3.90 \(इदं-
किमोरीश्की\). Also see P.6.3.91 \(आ सर्वनाम्नः\), which replaces d of tad with ā,
before dr̥ś.

४.३.१. प्रकृतिदर्शनं समापत्तिः ।
Whitney \(4.73\). O: °पतिः.
Translation: The term ‘reinstatement’ \(samāpatti\) refers to
the display of the original form.
Note: Here the term ‘original’ \(prakr̥ti\) refers to a stage in the deriva-
tion of a word, before changes like lengthening, or retroflexion of n or s are
effected. The state thus obtained offers us a theoretical starting point for the
transformations mentioned above, and while the reinstatement often results in
undoing of what Whitney \(1862: 219\) calls “anomalies of Vedic orthoepy,” it
does not necessarily result into a usable expression of the classical language.
This is because the process of reinstatement results in undoing of not only
Vedic anomalies, but also of some of the changes which are common in the
classical language. Such a reinstatement of the derivationally original form
takes place in the Padapāṭha and Kramapāṭha, in accordance with the rules that
follow.
Whitney points out that the term samāpatti does not occur in any other
grammatical treatise, though the related term samāpādya occurs once “in one of
the later chapters of the Rik Pr. \(xiii.11, 12\), in a passage so obscure, without
the light which the treatment of the subject in our own Prātiśākhya casts upon
it, that its meaning has, very naturally, been misapprehended by the learned
editor \(= Max MÜller\).” Now we know that the term does occur precisely in
the same meaning as our CA rule in APR \(147, p. 99\): षत्वणत्वोपाचारदीर्घत्वसमा-
पत्तेरपवादः. The finite verb samāpādyate is found in the same meaning in APR
\(214b\), which reinstates the final short vowel in the Padapāṭha for words like
jánimā \(AV 2.28.2\). The term samāpādya also appears in the Māṇḍūkīśikṣā,
see the note on the next rule. Further it is also found in the Upalekhasūtra
\(8.18\), which is identical with RPR \(13, verse 11, sūtra 30\).
A related term pratyāpatti occurs in Kātyāyana’s Vārttika on the Śiva-
sūtras, cf. लिङ्गार्था तु प्रत्यापत्तिः, MB \(Kielhorn edn., Vol.I., p. 14\). While this
term has the sense of reinstatement of an original stripped of unwanted altera-
tions, it has nothing to do with the Padapāṭha. However, the term pratyāpatti

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका573
has been used in a sense identical with samāpatti by K.V. Abhyankar \(1974:
25-27\).

Note: As Whitney explains: “Carcā1 \(see iv. 123 = CA 4.4.24\) des-
ignates the repetition, with iti interposed, made in the pada-text of a divisible
compound which is also pragr̥hya, or which ends in a vowel not subject to the
ordinary rules of combination: for example, satyānr̥té íti satya-anr̥té \(i.33.2\);
parihāra \(see iv. 117 = CA 4.4.18\) is the like repetition made in the krama-text
of a pragr̥hya, a divisible compound, a word requiring restoration to its natural
form, and the last word before a pause.” The term upācāra refers to the change
of ḥ to s before k and p by CA \(2.3.3 etc.\). The term ṭutva reminds one of the
usage in P.8.1.41 \(ष्टुना ष्टुः\), and refers to the change of t-series to ṭ-series. The
marker U added to the initial stop of a stop series becomes a notation for the
whole series of five members, cf. P.1.1.69 \(अणुदित् सवर्णस्य चाप्रत्ययः\). The CA
seems to have taken such conventions for granted and saw no need to explicitly
define them.
Compare the following verse of the Māṇḍūkīśikṣā \(verse 108\), Śikṣā-
saṃgraha, p. 472:
षत्वणत्वमुपाचारो दीर्घीभावस्तथैव च ।
यस्मिन् पदे निपद्यन्ते तत् समासा\(पा?\)द्यलक्षणम् ॥
For ān-pada, also see: RPR \(4.67\). For further discussion on śepa-
harṣaṇīm, see Note on CA \(2.2.17\). The terminology used in our CA rule is
comparable to the wording of APR \(147\).
Whitney \(1862: pp. 220-221\) notes some major problems, for which I
must quote him at length: 
“A quite embarrassing question now presents itself, in connec-
tion with the part of the text contained in this and the following
rules; namely, with reference to the constitution of the pada-text
which they imply. The actual pada-text of our manuscripts is
very sparing in its use of carcā, or repetition with iti interposed :
it avails itself of that expedient only in the case already referred
to as prescribed by iv.123 \(= CA 4.4.24\) or when a pragr̥hya is
likewise avagr̥hya. ... Now when we find put forth in our
treatise, as its leading and principal direction for the restoration
of the natural form in pada, a rule like the one here given, which
classes pada repetitions and krama repetitions together, and
corresponds, as regards the pada, nearly with the Vāj. Pr.,
we cannot help suspecting that it contemplates a pada-text in

1 The word carcāpadāni is also used with reference to split up words of the rules of Pāṇini by
Patañjali in his MB, न केवलानि चर्चापदानि व्याख्यानम् - वृद्धिः आत् ऐजिति ।, Vol. I, p. 11.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका575
which, as in that of the Vāj. Saṃhitā, the repetitions of krama
and pada extend over nearly the same classes of cases. It is
actually the fact that, if we allow the pada-text to be of the form
in which our manuscripts give it, there are but about half a
dozen words in the whole Atharvan text to which this rule and
the two following, all together, have any application : while on
the other hand, the Prātiśākhya is found to give no direction at
all for the use of iti alone in pada after a pragr̥hya, or for the
innumerable restitutions of natural form which are made in
words not repeated. I find myself, I must acknowledge, hardly
able to avoid the conclusion that this part of our Prātiśākhya
was framed to suit a pada-text in which all pragr̥hyas, divisible
words, and words requiring restoration to normal form, were
alike repeated, or suffered carcā : such seems to me to be the
only intelligible and consistent interpretation of its rules. That
the fourth section of the chapter contains a direction for carcā
agreeing with the nature of our extant pada-text, would find its
explanation in the evident character of that section as a foreign
addition to the main body of the work; we should have to
assume that the school to which the treatise as a whole
belonged, in its present form, framed its pada-text in the manner
there taught, and probably suffered that rule to take the place of
one of another character formerly contained in this section, and
now omitted from it; while yet they did not so recast the section
as to adapt it fully to their new method of construction of the
pada. This may seem like a violent and improbable supposition;
but it appears to me, after making every possible attempt to
avoid it, to involve less difficulty that the interpretation of the
rules of this section in such a manner as to make them suit the
pada-text of the manuscripts. ... One other solution of our
difficulties, less satisfactory, but also less violent, deserves to
be suggested. If we could omit the words carcāparihārayoḥ
from the rule altogether, leaving the latter to authorize a
restoration of normal form in the pada generally, we could
perhaps make shift to get along with such inconcinnities and
omissions as would still remain -- of which the principal would
be that the treatise made no provision for the use of iti after a
pragr̥hya word, and that it did not direct what form words
should have in the numerous repetitions of the krama-text.”

अध्याय ४, पाद ३
576
In response to Whitney’s proposals, we must make the following ob-
servations. The text of the CA as reconstructed on the basis of all the available
manuscripts does not support Whitney’s second solution of omitting the words
carcāparihārayoḥ from the present rule. 
Secondly, the rules do not specify where carcā occurs in the Padapāṭha,
but what to do when it occurs, thus giving us no direct clue to the extent of
carcā to be carried out in the Padapāṭha. Thus, there is really no reason to claim
that the CA assumes a different Padapāṭha in which carcā was carried out more
massively, as compared to the Padapāṭha available in the manuscripts. Actu-
ally, the fact that the existing Padapāṭha for the ŚAV deviates from the Pada-
pāṭha of the RV and VS, would itself be an indication of its independent trans-
mission. As Whitney himself observes elsewhere, the Padapāṭha for the 19th
Kāṇḍa considerably deviates from the rest of the earlier Kāṇḍas, and the fact
that this deviation is in the direction of the RV Padapāṭha would suggest that
the Padapāṭha that we have for the first 18 Kāṇḍas is fairly authentic. 
Finally, we should note that in citing examples of repetitions, the com-
mentary nowhere specifies whether it is citing from the Padapāṭha, or from the
Kramapāṭha. Whitney \(1862: 222\) remarks: “The commentator does not state
whether he takes his instances from the pada or from the krama text : according
to the construction of our present pada, they could only come from krama, if
the conclusion drawn above as to the original pada contemplated by our text is
correct, they may illustrate both.” Now, it is safer to assume that most of the
instances of repetitions are from the Kramapāṭha, where they occur on a vastly
larger scale, than to assume that all these examples are equally representative of
a now-lost original Padapāṭha. 
It seems to me that the CA \(4.4.24: प्रगृह्यावगृह्यचर्चायां क्रमवदुत्तरस्मिन्नवग्रहः\)
provides some clue that the scope of carcā and parihāra was different. The
repetitions were carried out on a much larger scale in the Kramapāṭha as com-
pared to the Padapāṭha, and that is why the rule says kramavat, namely that the
rules of restoration in repetitions were primarily meant to apply to the
Kramapāṭha, and were to be extended by analogy to the smaller corpus of
repetitions in the Padapāṭha. Such is my conclusion based on the CA rule, and
this agrees with Whitney’s observation that “the actual pada-text of our manu-
scripts is very sparing in its use of carcā, or repetition with iti interposed : it
avails itself of that expedient only in the case already referred to as prescribed
by iv.123 \(= CA 4.4.24\), or when a pragr̥hya is likewise avagr̥hya.” This is
supported by the CAB on CA \(4.4.24\).

Comparable to the use of the expression kramavat in CA \(4.4.24\) is the
use of the expression padavat in the Upalekhasūtras \(5.1, 5.3, 6.6, 6.7, 7.9
etc.\), where the basic rules describe what happens in the Padapāṭha, and the
description of what happens in the Kramapāṭha takes place by simply referring
to padavat.
S.S. Pandit \(AV edition, Vol.I., p. 5\) refers to “a Vaidika of the
Atharvaveda from Māhulī; his full name is Keśava Bhaṭ bin Dājī Bhaṭ. He
knew the Saṃhitā and Pada texts by heart as also the Krama of the first four
Kāṇḍas.” Later \(ibid., p. 8\), Pandit refers to another reciter: “This is Venkaṇ
Bhaṭjī otherwise known as Venku Dājī. ... He knew the whole of the Saṃhitā
and the Pada text by heart and a considerable portion in the form of Krama and
Jaṭā.” Unfortunately, Pandit did not make any record of the Krama and the
Jaṭāpāṭha recitations, and that information is now mostly lost to us, since none
of the present day AV reciters are capable of reciting these versions. Whitney
too was merely theorizing about the Kramapāṭha, and had, as far as I can tell,
no access to a manuscript of Krama. Now I have found three important
manuscripts at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, which give us at
least a glimpse of these advanced recitational versions. There are two
manuscripts \(BORI, Mss. 128/1879-80 and 83/1880-81\) which provide the
Jaṭāpāṭha for the 15th and the 17th Kāṇḍas, respectively. There is also a
manuscript \(BORI: 133/1879-80\) of the Kramapāṭha for the 20th Kāṇḍa. I
have been currently transcribing these manuscripts and hope to publish these
texts along with my analysis in future. While I do not wish to go into details of
these texts at this point, I would like to mention a few important differences
from the manner of citations in our commentary and the pattern found in the
manuscripts of Krama and Jaṭāpāṭha. The examples of samāpatti cited in the
CAB typically read like: | ‘नि॒षेच॑नम् । नि॒सेच॑न॒मिति॑ नि॒ऽसेच॑नम्’ \(क्रम, अ.वे. १.३.१\).
This gives an impression that the reinstatement phrase like nisecanam iti ni
’secanam immediately follows after the original Pada: niṣecanam. The pattern
noticed in the manuscripts of Jaṭā and Kramapāṭha is somewhat different. In

अध्याय ४, पाद ३
578
the Kramapāṭha, if we have a sequence of three Padas, e.g. a, b, and c, with the
Pada b undergoing reinstatement, we get the following sequence: ab / bc / b iti
b. For example, notice the reinstatement for the word puruṣṭuta \(AV 20.15.4,
BORI ms 133/1879-80, folio 12\): व॒यं पु॑रुष्टुत । पु॒रु॒ष्टु॒त॒ ये । पु॒रु॒स्तु॒तेति॑ पुरु°स्तुत.
A minor feature to note is that the BORI manuscripts for Krama and Jaṭā use a
small circle to indicate the avagraha. A similar general pattern for reinstatement
is noticed in the manuscript for the Jaṭāpāṭha. In a sequence of Padas, such as
a, b, and c, if the Pada b requires reinstatement, we get the following
recitational sequence: abbaab / bccbbc / b iti b. To illustrate this pattern, I can
offer the following example from AV \(15.2.6, BORI ms 128/1879-80, folio
11\): च॒ प॒रि॒ष्क॒न्दौ प॑रिष्क॒न्दौ च॑ च परिष्क॒न्दौ । प॒रि॒ष्क॒न्दौ मनो॒ मनः॑ परिष्क॒न्दौ प॑रिष्क॒न्दौ
मनः॑ । प॒रि॒स्क॒न्दाविति॑ प॒रि॒°स्क॒न्दौ. However, the general features of reinstatement
as described by the CA and the CAB are confirmed by the newly found
manuscripts of Kramapāṭha and Jaṭāpāṭha.
४.३.३. पूर्वपदनिमित्तानाम् ।

a correction.
Translation: \[In the repetitions of the Padapāṭha and

transformations\] which are caused by \[conditioning elements
residing in\] the preceding words \[i.e. preceding components of

Note: The commentary does not offer any new positive examples of
reinstatement, but refers us to examples on the preceding rule, such as:

परा॒ऽअय॑नम्’ \(क्रम, अ.वे. १.३४.३\)।. However, it does offer counter examples
where the reinstatement does not take place, because the cause for the trans-
formations is within the same word.

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका579
Whitney, along with a small number of manuscripts, has the reading
पूर्वपदनिमित्तानां च. With this reading in mind, Whitney objects to the treatment
given to this rule by the commentator: “He cites no examples, but says ‘the il-
lustrations are those already given:’ namely, under the preceding rule. Ac-
cording to this exposition, the present rule would seem merely an explanatory
appendage to its predecessor. But this is clearly inadmissible: not only ought
we to have it, in that case, combined with the other, so as to form part of it, but
more especially, it would not contain the particle ca, ‘and,’ which positively
stamps it as something added to the latter. We cannot avoid, as it seems to me,
understanding rule 74 \(= CA 4.3.2\) of the abnormal changes of disjoined and
independent words, and rule 75 \(= CA 4.3.3\) of such as are produced by an
altering influence in the prior member of a compound.” A good deal of the
force of Whitney’s argument is lost when we realize that a majority of the
manuscripts do not have ca in the rule, and I have not reconstructed it in my
critical text.

अध्याय ४, पाद ३

Note: It should be carefully noted that the reinstatement \(samāpatti\)
prescribed here does not occur in the normal Padapāṭha for these words. The
normal Padapāṭha readings for the above forms are परि॑ष्कृता, प्रा॒णन्ति॑, सनृता॑ऽवत्,
and अ॒पा॒ष्ठऽव॑त्, respectively, and show no restoration taught by this rule. We,
however, understand that there is samāpatti in the Kramapāṭha.
Also, as Whitney notes: “The rule, as these illustrations help to show,
is not a mere additional specification to the one preceding, affecting only the
cases to which the other applies : in that case it would have been incorporated
with it, not made to follow it, as an independent precept; but it concerns all
changes occurring in the interior of divisible words, whether in the former or
the latter member, and a part of the commentator’s examples, rehearsed under
rule 75 \(= CA 4.3.3\) belong to it, and not to the latter.”
The APR \(147, p. 99\) lists the examples sūnŕ̥tāvat \(AV 13.1.1\) and
apāṣṭhávat \(AV 14.1.29\) as exceptions to the procedure of samāpatti, and
Surya Kanta interprets this as saying that we do not get the restored forms
sunŕ̥tā-vat and apasthá-vat.

\(‘प्र॒प॒णः,’ अ.वे. ३.१५.४\)
Note: Whitney translates this rule as: “In which case restoration is
made, even when the word is farther compounded with another member.” This
translation is further explained: “That is to say : a compound which, being divi-
sible by avagraha, is entitled to restoration of the normal form of its constituent
parts, retains its right even when, by farther composition, the division of its
original members is lost.”
The commentary CAB seems to take a more justifiable approach. It
continues the word इङ्ग्यानाम् into this rule: अन्येनापि पर्वणा इङ्ग्यमानानाम्. For ex-
ample, in the word víṣitasrupaḥ \(AV 6.60.1\), the change of s to ṣ occurs be-
cause of compounding ví\+sita. Once this joint were separated with an ava-
graha, one would expect the dental s to be restored. However, in the carcā and
parihāra type of repetitions, the expression víṣitasrupaḥ is separated at another
juncture, e.g. vísita-srupaḥ. Here, the old joint between ví and sita remains un-
separated, and yet, by the present rule, there is restoration of the original sita,
giving us vísita-srupaḥ.
Whitney considers the cited verse to be “more than usually mutilated
and obscure,” and he refuses to translate it. He reads matvaṇatvaṃ and
avagr̥hyet tathaiva. Of these, matva is clearly a mistake for ṣatva, and the
second expression clearly reads in H as: avagr̥hye tathaiva. With these correc-
tions, the verse no longer remains mutilated and obscure. The verse says that
the retroflex ṣ and ṇ, which are part of the original form \(prakr̥tyā\), remain un-
altered even after the separation of constituent members of a word with an ava-
graha. For example, in the form upatíṣṭhantī \(AV 12.5.24\), the occurrence of ṣ
is not caused by joining upa to the root, and hence, the separation of upa does
not lead to the reinstatement of ṣ to s. Similarly, in the example prapaṇáḥ \(AV
3.15.4\), the retroflex ṇ is part of the original root, and is not brought about by
the combination of that root with pra. Therefore, separation of that preverb
does not lead to the reinstatement of ṇ to n.

अध्याय ४, पाद ३
582
In most of the above examples, the Pada as well as Krama show the re-
sult of samāpatti, even when no repetition \(carcā or parihāra\) is involved.
Thus, this is a more generic rule, as compared to the previous rules. The only
case where the Pada text given in the VVRI edition does not show samāpatti is
AV \(7.66.1 = W: 7.64.1\): अ॒भि॒ऽनि॒ष्पत॑न्. It is not clear why there is no samā-
patti in this case, as it is seen in others. Whitney also notes this anomaly and
suggests that the writing of ṣ in such examples may simply be an attempt at
representing the labial spirant, i.e. upadhmānīya. He cites other cases where
the same thing happens for the jihvāmūlīya. Concerning the textual variation,
Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p. 431\) says: “Prāt. iv.77 \(= CA 4.3.5\) appears to
require as pada-reading in b abhi-niḥpátan; but all the pada-mss. give -niṣp-,
and SPP. also adopts that in his pada-text: abhinipatan would be a decidedly
preferable reading.” One should also note the fact that while the CA rule
would require samāpatti in the form of abhi-niḥpatan, the lone manuscript of
the commentary reads -niṣpatat. Thus, the manuscripts of the commentary
CAB seem to come under the influence of the majority of the later mss. of the
AV, and this influence often manifests in the citations of forms which violate
the very rules which they are supposed to illustrate.
Whitney offers several more examples for this rule: viskandha-dūṣaṇa
\(AV 2.4.1\), atisthā-vant \(AV 3.22.6\), su-pranīti \(AV 5.11.5\), durnāma-cātana
\(AV 8.6.3\), anu-visicyate \(AV 8.10.33\), abhimoda-mud \(AV 11.7.26\), jāgrat-
suḥsvapnyam and svapne-duḥsvapnyam \(AV 16.6.9\), pr̥thivisat-bhyaḥ \(AV
18.4.78\). Exceptions to this rule are made in rule CA \(4.3.25\).

Note: As Whitney explains: “Vigr̥hya denotes a word which is alto-
gether independent, and therefore disjoined from others in the pada-text, a
nānāpada, in distinction from avagr̥hya, which means ‘divisible into its con-
stituents \(pūrvapada and uttarapada\), as a compound.’ In the construction of
the krama-text, then, where each word is in succession taken along with its
predecessor and its successor, a word which in saṃhitā has an abnormal form,
under the influence of the former or of the latter, retains that form when in the
same kramapada with the alternating word, but is restored to its natural form
when making a kramapada with any other word.”
Thus, when the original sequence āpo hi ṣṭhā mayobhuvaḥ is changed
into its Krama version, we get the following kramapadas : āpo hi / hi ṣṭha / sthā
mayobhuvaḥ. Here, in the second kramapada, we get the form ṣṭha. Its cere-
bralization is caused by the i that precedes within the same kramapada, but it is
stripped of its long ā, which is caused in the saṃhitā by its connection with the
following word, from which it is disjoined. In the next kramapada, we have
the form sthā. Here, it has the long vowel caused by its joining the following
word, but it is stripped of its cerebrals, because it is disjoined from the pre-
ceding word. Thus, this reinstatement of the original form in the Kramapāṭha
is a dynamic interactive process, and works feature by feature, depending upon
the cause being joined or disjoined.
The BORI manuscript \(133/1879-80, folio 49\) of the Kramapāṭha
provides an example of this kind in AV \(20.67.1\): सु॒न्वा॒नो हि । हि ष्म॑ । स्मा॒
यज॑ति. Folio 51 offers an example from AV \(20.68.11\): नि षी॑दत । सी॒द॒तेन्द्र॑म्.
Whitney explains the counter-examples: “Here the ṣ of niṣecanam and ṇ
of parāyaṇe are maintained wherever the words containing them enter into a
kramapada, and only suffer restoration \(by rule 75 = CA 4.3.3 above\) to s and
n in the repetition or parihāra.” Compare the example from AV \(20.88.1\)
found in the BORI manuscript \(133/1879-80, folio 64\): बृह॒स्पति॑स्त्रिषध॒स्थः ।

Note: As Whitney explains: “The rule, however, evidently applies not
less to the krama than to the pada text, and is even intended chiefly for the for-
mer : it is our authority for shortening a protracted final when it comes to stand
at the end of a kramapada, while it is left long when taken together with its suc-

Note: Whitney explains: “From rule 74 \(= CA 4.3.2\), which pre-
scribes restoration of the normal form of a lengthened vowel in both parts of a
repetition, one might draw the conclusion that the word here in question should
be written, when repeated, caturātra iti catuḥ-rātraḥ : hence this rule, which
teaches the reading catūrātra iti catuḥ-rātraḥ.” Whitney recognizes that the
commentator is citing the Kramapāṭha when he says: catūrātra iti catuḥ-rātraḥ.
However, we must note the fact that this word is separable with an avagraha in
the Padapāṭha, and the Padapāṭha reading as given in the VVRI edn. shows the
application of this rule: catuḥ-rātraḥ. Whitney \(AV Translation, Vol.II., p.
645\) himself notes the pada reading catuḥ-rātraḥ and says that it is the subject
of the present CA rule. Thus, on the basis of all known evidence, this rule is
applicable to the Padapāṭha as well, where the components of the word are
separated with an avagraha.
४.३.९. पदान्तविकृतानाम् ।
Whitney \(4.81\).
Translation: \[There is reinstatement of the original forms\] of

\(पद, अ.वे. ६.११८.३, संहिता \! ‘अ॒भ्यैमि॑ देवाः’\)।
Note: Whitney has a puzzling remark on the commentary: “The
commentator’s paraphrase is padāntavikr̥tānāṃ ca ṣatvādīnāṃ samāpattir
bhavati, which would seem to show that he understands the rule as referring to
the same series of abnormal alterations which was detailed in rule 74 \(= CA
4.3.2\). His illustrations, however, put quite another face upon the matter. ...
Here the only changes of form which have undergone restoration are the regu-
lar conversions of i into y \(by iii.39 = CA 3.2.16\) before the following dis-
similar vowel. We are thus guided to a different interpretation of the rule:
whereas we have heretofore dealt with irregular or abnormal changes only,
learning under what circumstances, in pada and in krama, they become re-

अध्याय ४, पाद ३
586
versed, and the original form restored, here we are taught that all alterations
made at the end of a word, by the ordinary as well as the extraordinary combi-
nations of the phrase, undergo restoration when the word comes to stand, in
pada or in krama, before a pause \(virāme, rule 79 = CA 4.3.7\). It should be
remarked that the final repetition of this rule is wanting in the manuscript, and
that we cannot therefore be certain that we may not have lost with it other ex-
amples and farther exposition, which would have set the meaning of the rule,
or the commentator’s apprehension of it, in a clearer light.” 
I now have a complete photocopy of the original Berlin manuscript, H,
which was handcopied by \(or for?\) Whitney. The manuscript clearly reads य-
त्वादीनां समापत्तिर्भवति, and not षत्वादीनां as claimed by Whitney. Additionally,
Whitney’s claim that “the final repetition of this rule is wanting in the manu-
script” is also not supported by the manuscript which clearly shows this final
repetition. Thus, one wanders how accurate the hand-copy made by Whitney
was. Perhaps, not unlike the original copyist, Whitney himself \(or one who
copied the text for him\) occasionally miscopied the text. Since, the original
manuscript was in Germany, and he had no continuous access to it, he was un-
able to correct his own errors in copying the manuscript. On the other hand,
Whitney is absolutely correct that this rule requires reinstatement of the origi-
nals of all word-final changes, rather than the restoration of only the ‘abnor-
mal’ changes.

Note: As Whitney notes: “The Prātiśākhya now goes on to inform us
where restoration must be made of alterations which have taken place in the
interior of a word, and not under the influence of any cause lying outside of the
word itself. The rules in this portion of the work are in great part the reverse of
others formerly given, when the subject under treatment was the conversion of
pada into saṃhitā. Thus, the present precept is the correlative of ii.91 \(= CA
2.4.11\).”
Restorations of this kind are now confirmed for the Kramapāṭha in the
BORI manuscript 133/1879-80. Folio 49 provides the following instance from
AV \(20.67.1\): इत्सि॑षासति । सि॒षा॒स॒ति॒ स॒हस्रा॑ । सि॒सा॒स॒तीति॑ सिसासति.
We should also note that the so-called ‘original’ form restored by rules
like these in the Padapāṭha is simply a stage in the derivation of the word, prior
to the application of the cerebralization rule. It is ‘original’ in a theoretical
sense, namely it is prior in the derivational sequence.

Note: Whitney appropriately notes that the alterations in these words
are restored, even though these are not avagr̥hya words. However, the Pada
manuscripts do show jāḥ-patyam as an avagr̥hya form. It is not clear whether
this is simply the copyist’s error in the Pada manuscripts, or a reflection of a
different of opinion. However, the CA and the APR \(p. 145\) agree on treating
jāspatyam as an indivisible expression. For a discussion on jāspatyam, see
Note on CA \(4.2.18\).
On nārṣdena \(AV 4.19.2\), Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I., p. 183\) says:
“The pada-mss. waver between nārsadéna and nārṣ- \(our Bp. emends ṣ to s;
Op. is altered obscurely; D.K. have s\), but s is certainly the true reading, as
required by Prāt. iv.83 \(= CA 4.3.11\); SPP. has wrongly chosen ṣ for his
pada-text.” The VVRI edition reads nārṣadena in its Padapāṭha, while it notes
the variant nārsadena in the footnotes.
Referring to duṣṭara, Surya Kanta \(APR, p. 142\) suggests: “The Pada-
reading dustá- instead of duḥ-tá- indicates that the authors of that text regarded
it as an irregular compound of duḥ and stára from the root star.” Restoration of
this word in the Kramapāṭha is now confirmed by the BORI manuscript
133/1879-80. Folio 51 offers an instance from AV \(20.67.2\): च॒ दु॒ष्टर॑म् ।

Note: Concerning the verses quoted in the commentary, Whitney says:
“I have not succeeded in amending the text so as to be able to translate the
whole passage.” Now we can make sense of these verses without any major
difficulties.
The segment दीर्घोऽकितेति refers to Pāṇini 7.4.83 \(दीर्घोऽकितः\) which pre-
scribes lengthening of the reduplication of the root in intensive forms like
lālapīti. What Whitney read as नुजादीनाम् in the manuscript H, needs to be
amended to तुजादीनाम्, and refers to Pāṇini 6.1.7 \(तुजादीनां दीर्घोऽभ्यासस्य\) which
prescribes lengthening of the reduplication of the root in forms like tūtujānaḥ.
The expression which the manuscript and Whitney read as यङ्लकोः clearly
stands for यङ्लुकोः. This expression refers to the affix yaṄ prescribed by
Pāṇini in forms like lālapyate, and its deletion \(luk\) in forms like lālapīti.
Lengthening of the reduplication of the root in such forms is prescribed by
Pāṇini 7.4.83 cited above. The segment सवर्णे च परोक्षायाम् also refers to Pāṇini
6.4.78 \(अभ्यासस्यासवर्णे\). This rule says that a reduplication of a root which ends
in i or u, followed by a non-homogeneous vowel, has these sounds substituted
by iyaṄ and uvaṄ respectively. Thus, in the example uvokha, the reduplica-
tion u is changed to uv, before okha. On the other hand, in the form ūkhatuḥ,
the reduplication u is followed by ukh\+ atuḥ. Since, the u is followed by a
savarṇa “homogeneous” vowel, it is not replaced by uv, but is combined with
the following u to yield a long ū. The verse cited by the commentary refers to
such forms and says that the long vowels in such forms are not to be restored
to short vowels in their Pada form. Thus, the verse is no longer enigmatic.
Also compare the examples listed under CA \(3.1.13: अकारस्याभ्यासस्य
बहुलम्\) and APR \(209, pp. 126-7\). 
Restorations of this kind for the Kramapāṭha are now confirmed by the
BORI manuscript 133/1879-80. Folio 57 offers an instance from AV
\(20.73.6\): तवि॑षीं वावृधे । वा॒वृ॒धे॒ शवः॑ । व॒वृ॒ध॒ इति॑ ववृधे.

forms such as vāvr̥dhāna.

\(पद, अ.वे. १.८.४, संहिता \! ‘वा॒वृ॒धा॒नः’\)।
Note: The passage vāvr̥dhāna iva cited by the CAB is not found in
the Vulgate of the AV, and Surya Kanta \(APR, Introduction, p. 40\) suggests
that this may have occurred in the genuine Śaunakīya recension of the AV, and
that the Vulgate is not the genuine Śaunakīya recension. 
About the gaṇa referred to in the rule, Whitney says: “The gaṇa might
be filled up from the material collected and presented in the notes to the first
section of the third chapter, but I have no taken the trouble to put it together, as
it is uncertain how much and what the authors of the treatise meant the precept
to cover.” Unfortunately, no such gaṇa is collected in the APR either, and
hence we are unable to determine its exact membership. 
However, note that the APR \(209, pp. 126-127\) lists the examples
sāsahānaḥ \(AV 3.6.4, pada = sasahānaḥ\) and sāsahim \(AV 3.21.3, pada =
sasahim\). Curiously, the passage in which the form sāsahānaḥ occurs is
sāsahānaḥ iva, and one wonders whether the unattested vāvr̥dhānaḥ iva of the
CAB is simply an error for an original sāsahānaḥ iva.
Restorations of this kind for the Kramapāṭha are now confirmed by the
BORI manuscript 133/1879-80. Folio 7 offers an instance from AV \(20.11.1\):
त॒न्वा॑ वावृधा॒नः । वा॒वृ॒धा॒नो भूरि॑दात्रः । व॒वृ॒धा॒न इति॑ व॒वृ॒धा॒नः. The accent-marking in
the repetition is somewhat peculiar, but not uncommon. The restoration of
sāsahiḥ in the Kramapāṭha is also found on folio 17 in AV \(20.19.6\): वाजे॑षु
सास॒हिः । सा॒स॒हिर्भ॑व । स॒स॒हिरिति॑ स॒स॒हिः.

६. ११.३\)।
Note: The explanatory paraphrase of the rule is missing from the
manuscript of the commentary, and it is not clear what the term anahva stands
for. Looking at the instances cited in the commentary, Whitney suggests that,
“so far as these instances go, anahva might be understood as designating an
aorist form which has lost its accent; or virtually, an aorist subjunctive.” K.V
Abhyankar and J.M. Shukla \(1977: 19\) refer to our CA rule, but mistakenly
explain the term anahva as “a tech. term used by the authors of the Prātiśākhya
works for frequentative formations such as rīriṣaḥ, cākl̥pat etc.” These forms
are not frequentative forms. They are augmentless aorists, or aorist injunctives.
Renou \(1942: 364\) refers to Weber’s suggestion that anahva may be a
misreading for anaṭka, meaning ‘dépourvu d’augment.’ Pāṇini \(6.4.71:
लुङ्लङ्ऌङ्ष्वडुदात्तः\) uses the term aṬ to refer to the past tense augment in imper-
fect and aorist forms, and says that this augment is dropped if these forms are
used in conjunction with mā, or even otherwise in Vedic, cf. P.6.4.74 \(न
माङ््योगे\) and P.6.4.75 \(बहुलं छन्दस्यमाङ््योगेऽपि\). This is how Pāṇini accounts for
what modern scholars refer to as aorist injunctive. Thus, the term anaṭka could
easily refer to an augmentless aorist, or better, as Whitney recognizes, an aorist
subjunctive, an injunctive in modern terminology. The counter-examples of the
commentary then make sense, because they are examples of augment-retaining

अध्याय ४, पाद ३
592
aorists. The vertical Devanagari cluster for ṭka \(= ट्व\)could have been easily
misread as hva \(ह्व\).
For the intruding mā rīriṣaḥ naḥ AV \(11.2.29\), the VVRI Pada reading
is ririṣaḥ. However, it is not clear why this example is cited by the commen-
tary. Whitney rightly criticizes the commentator and says: “this is, however, no
counter-example, but precisely analogous with the two already cited for the
same word.” Once we take this example out, the term anaṭka becomes applica-
ble to the remaining counter-examples.
We should, however, note that if anahva is a copyist’s error for anaṭka,
it must have been a very ancient error going all the way back to the archetype
of all our available manuscripts.
Concerning another matter, Whitney says: “The text \(of AV\) affords
one other word, śuśucaḥ \(xviii.2.4: s. śūśucaḥ\), of the same class with those
treated in this rule. Its omission must be understood as signifying, either that
the verse containing it was not in the Atharvan text of the authors and com-
mentator of our Prātiśākhya, or that their text read, with the Rig-Veda \(x.16.1\),
śocaḥ, or, finally, that the word escaped their notice.” Whitney \(AV Transl.
Vol.II., p. 833\) further informs us: “Our Bp. appears to give in a śuśucaḥ, as it
∀apparently\# ought to do according to Prāt. iv. 86 \(= CA 4.3.14\), though the
example is not quoted in the comment on that rule; but the other pada-mss.
∀and SPP.\# have śūśucaḥ.”
As far as the examples cited by the commentator are concerned, there is
some variation in the manuscripts and editions. For AV \(4.7.3\), the VVRI
edition offers the Padapāṭha reading rūrupaḥ, but mentions rurupaḥ as a manu-
script variant. For AV \(6.51.3\), it offers the Pada reading rīriṣaḥ, without
noting any manuscript variants. On AV \(4.6.3\), Whitney \(AV Transl. Vol.I.,
p. 155\) says: “The construction of the augmentless aorist-form rūrupas with ná
instead of mā́ is against all rule and usage; the easiest emendation would be to
nā́rūrupas; Ppp. gives na rūrūpaḥ. SPP. unaccountably reads rūrupaḥ in pada-
text, both here and in 5d, and 6d, against all but one of his pada-mss. in this
verse, and also against Prāt. iv.86 \(= CA 4.3.14\), which distinctly requires
rurupaḥ; and \(in all three cases alike\) the pada-mss. add after the word the sign
which they are accustomed to use when a pada-reading is to be changed to
something else in saṃhitā.” It is to be noted that the pada-reading for AV
\(4.6.3\) given by the CAB in fact completely supports Whitney’s suggested
emendation.
The examples rūrupaḥ and rīriṣaḥ are listed under APR \(212, p. 129\) as
examples of lengthening, and seem to belong to the nārakādigaṇa, referred to in
CA \(3.1.21: nārakādīnām prathamasya\). However, the nārakādigaṇa as found

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका593
in APR \(212, pp. 129-130\) lists no form of kr̥p in this category. No example
of kr̥p is offered by the CAB either. Whitney comments: “For the root kr̥p,
either the commentator furnished no instances, or the manuscript has omitted
them : the only derivative of that root, so far as I can discover, which the rule
can have any concern with, is cākl̥pat \(vi.35.3 : p. cakl̥pat\); since cakl̥puḥ and
cakl̥pe would properly fall under rule 84 \(= CA 4.3.12\).” All the three forms
are, however, listed by the APR under APR \(209, pp. 126-127\), and not as
part of the nārakādigaṇa. Given the demonstrable dependence of the CAB on
the APR, the dislocation of these examples in the APR may have led the CAB
to not citing any example here for the root kr̥p/kl̥p.

Note: The VVRI edition gives जिहीडाहम् for the Saṃhitā, but offers
the manuscript variant जीहीडाहम्. Whitney’s edition also offers जिहीडाहम् as
the Saṃhitā reading. This change in the AV reading may have occurred under
the influence of the RV tradition. The RV \(10.83.5\) reads: जिहीळाहम्. For
further discussion, see Note on CA \(3.1.14\). The APR \(209, pp. 126-127\)

Note: Whitney appropriately says that this rule refers to a Gaṇa, and
that ideally it should have been worded: dīdāyādīnām. Compare CA 3.1.22
\(दीदायादीनां द्वितीयस्य\). However, no manuscript supports the reading
dīdāyādīnām. The commentary here cites the same examples as are cited under

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका595
CA \(3.1.22\), clearly suggesting that by the present rule, it recognizes the same
gaṇa as referred to in CA \(3.1.22\).
CA \(3.1.22\) teaches the reverse doctrine that the second syllable of
words like dīdāyat, read as dīdayat in the Padapāṭha\), should be lengthened in
the Saṃhitāpāṭha. The present rule teaches the reinstatement of the short vowel
in the Padapāṭha. Also see the Note on CA \(3.1.22\).

Note: The examples cited by the CAB are found listed under APR
\(212\). About the condition ākhyāte in the rule, Whitney says: “He \(= the
commentator\) does not explain the meaning of the restriction ākhyāte added to
the rule, nor cite any counter-example. I can discover no other reason for it
than the occurrence of the word yavayāvānaḥ, at ix.2.13 : this may have been
deemed by the authors of the treatise to contain the causative \(kāritānta\) aya,
and therefore to require the rule to be so framed as to exclude it. But the word
is divided by the pada-text yava-yāvānaḥ, as if composed of yava and yāvan,
from yā : and this seems the best account to be given of it.” This form is not
listed by the APR \(212, pp. 129-130\) among other forms of yu which are the
appropriate positive examples for our present rule. However, the APR \(147,
7j, p. 106\) clearly lists as exception to reinstatement of the original short vowel
for the long vowel of the saṃhitā \(दीर्घत्वसमापत्तेरपवादः\) the following examples:
śapatha-yā́vanīm \(AV 4.17.2\) and yava-yā́vānaḥ \(AV 9.2.13\). Here, we do
not get reinstatement to yávanīm and yávānaḥ. Thus, Whitney’s guess turns
out to be absolutely correct.

Whitney’s reading for this rule, based on his lone manuscript H, was:
vani-yami-śrathi-glāpi. However, he says: “The form of our rule 93 \(= CA
4.3.21\), it may be remarked, is somewhat unusual: we should expect at the end
of it the genitive plural ending: thus, °glāpīnām.” Whitney’s expectation is
supported by all the other manuscripts which contain this rule. 
४.३.२२. इङ्ग्यवच्च ।
Whitney: no such rule. A, B, C, D, P: इग्य°.
Translation: \[There is reinstatement in the Padapāṭha and
Kramapāṭha of the original forms for compound-expressions\]
which contain components separable with an avagraha \(iṅgya =
avagr̥hyamāṇa\).
चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - इङ्ग्यवच्च ।... missing commentary.
Note: Just working with the defective manuscript H, Whitney says:
“The manuscript contains no final repetition of this rule \(= CA 4.3.21\), but
offers, after the last citation, the words iṅgyavac ca. What to make of these
words I do not precisely know: they may be part of a cited verse, of which the
rest, along with the repetition of the rule, is lost; or they may possibly belong to
an omitted rule: but I can hardly suppose the latter to be the case, not seeing
what the meaning of the phrase should be, as a rule or a part of one.” 
Obviously, Whitney was wrong. This is a rule and this fact is sup-
ported by most manuscripts. Unfortunately, the commentary on this rule is
missing. Even after finding this rule in the second manuscript, Whitney \(1880:
169\) says: “The words iṅgyavac ca are in fact found in B. as the next rule; but,
in the absence of a comment and illustrations to show what is the meaning, I do
not venture to attempt the interpretation of a phrase so indefinite.” 
Besides this rule, the term iṅgya appears in CA 4.3.4 \(इङ्ग्यानाम्\) and the
related term aniṅga, which should perhaps be read as aniṅgya, is found in rule
CA 4.1.34 \(अनिङ्गेन पूर्वेण\). The commentary CAB on CA 4.3.4 renders the term
iṅgya by avagr̥hyamāṇa and the term refers to forms which undergo division,
or separation by avagraha. CA 4.3.4 says that restoration of pre-change forms
is made only in such compounds which are resolved into their constituent ele-
ments in the Padapāṭha. One wonders whether CA 4.3.4 applies to restoration
in the Padapāṭha, and whether an extension of the same restoration of iṅgya
words to Kramapāṭha is enjoined by the present rule iṅgyavac ca. Perhaps, this

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका599
rule was necessary, so that a prohibition of samāpatti for aṣṭan etc. could be
taught by the next rule precisely for separable compounds of various kinds in
the following rules.

Note: Concerning the example aṣṭā-yoniḥ cited by the commentator,
Whitney says that this is a blunder “for the word is read with a short vowel in
both pada and saṃhitā in our Atharvan manuscripts, nor is yoni mentioned
\(iii.2 = CA 3.1.2\) by the Prātiśākhya among words before which the final
vowel of the numeral is made long.” The same reading is exhibited by the
VVRI edition. There are indeed no manuscript variants cited which agree with
the reading as given by the CAB. Such instances may perhaps reflect a
process of analogical extension of this lengthening in certain recitational tradi-
tions which instinctively made this change, without realizing that there was no
authority for such a change in the Prātiśākhya.

अध्याय ४, पाद ३

Whitney comments: “He \(= the commentator\) also interposes, between
the first and third examples, aṣṭā-yoniḥ; but this is a blunder, for the word is
read with a short vowel in both pada and saṃhitā \(viii.9.21\), in our Atharvan
manuscripts, nor is yoni mentioned \(iii.2 = CA 3.1.2\) by the Prātiśākhya
among words before which the final vowel of the numeral is made long.”
It should also be noted that the examples aṣṭāyoniḥ, aṣṭāparṇaḥ, and
aṣṭādaṃṣṭraḥ are not found in the corresponding list of examples in the APR
\(147b\). The rest of the examples are found in the APR \(147b\) exactly in the
same order. It is possible that the additional examples found in the CAB are a
later addition to an old list. The APR \(147b: aṣṭanaḥ\) also seems to be directly
referring to our present rule.
Also, see the Note on CA \(3.1.2\).

Note: I agree with Whitney’s statement that the Pada usage as regards
the forms pra / hiṇomi and pra / hiṇuta is quite anomalous. He further says: “I
can only conjecture that it may have been adopted in order to mark the
euphonic alteration as itself of anomalous and exceptional character: there
being, so far as I have been able to find, no other cases in which a preposition
lingualizes the nasal of a conjugational sign.” The exceptional character of
such changes is noted by Pāṇini in his rules P.8.4.15 \(हिनुमीना\) and P.8.4.16
\(आनि लोट्\). The change is exceptional on two counts. First, it occurs when the
cause of this change is in a separate uncompounded word \(असमासेऽपि, in P.
8.4.14\). Second, the n undergoing this change does not belong to the root, but
to the affix. Thus, it is possible, as Whitney suggests, that the Padapāṭha
marked this exceptional nature by proposing to maintain the retroflexion of n

dhāyāḥ, aghayanti, paniḥpadā, atisthipam, dadhāra, jagāra, and mimāya. These

states in a grammatical derivation. A rule like this shows that, even when the
Padapāṭha is identical with the Saṃhitāpāṭha, the ancient Indian grammarians
knew the notion of a sequential grammatical derivation of a word passing
through various stages of morphophonemic changes. It is also the case in
some of these forms, that the ‘original’ form implied is closer to the form as
found in the classical language. However, this is not always the case.
The APR \(147d\) seems to be quoting the whole of our present rule and
the CAB quotes all the same examples which are cited in the APR in the same
order. For the last instance, however, note that AV \(9.10.21, VVRI edn.
9.15.21: gaur in mimāya ...\) offers mimāya in both the Saṃhitā and Padapāṭha.
As this verse is a variant of the RV \(1.164.41: gaurīr mimāya ...\), it is likely
that an earlier mīmāya was altered to mimāya under the influence of the
R̥gvedic tradition. Most probably, the reading of AV \(9.10.21\) known to the
author of the CA was mīmāya.
Whitney further points out: “Of the class of the first three cases is sam-
niṣadya \(iv.16.2\), which equally calls for inclusion in this rule, unless the
reading in our pada manuscript is a copyist’s error, and should be amended to
sam-nisadya.” The APR \(147\) does not include this case among those where
reinstatement of the original is prohibited. The Padapāṭha in the VVRI edition
reads sam-niṣadya, and no manuscript variants are mentioned..
४.३.२६. प्रपणः पणतेरेव ।

Translation: \[There is no reinstatement in the Padapāṭha and

Note: Referring to the reading of the commentary in H, Whitney
says: “In his paraphrase, the commentator says prapaṇa iti paratairaka samā-
pattir na bhavati; but what paratairaka is, I do not know.” My own best guess

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका603
is that paratairaka is a corruption by the copyist of the phrase paṇatereva. My
guess is based on the following reasoning. In a sequence such as paṇatereva,
the initial part of ṇ \[perhaps originally written in a way similar to the North
Indian Nagari ण\] was read as r, and the remaining part was read as a Pr̥ṣṭha-
mātrā for the next syllable, i.e. te. This syllable te with an added Pr̥ṣṭhamātrā
was then interpreted as tai. Finally, the reva was miscopied as raka. 
Again, referring to the commentary on this rule in the manuscript H,
Whitney says: “Its \(=of the rule\) repetition before the one next following is
wanting in the manuscript: possibly, then \(as in the case of rule 81 = CA
4.3.19, above\), we have lost something in the way of exposition or illustration
which would have farther enlightened us.” My photocopy of the same manu-
script which was hand-copied by Whitney clearly shows the final repetition of
this rule, and this is one of those cases where Whitney missed something while
hand-copying the text from the Berlin manuscript, H.

Note: Whitney is not correct in saying that “the commentator para-
phrases padatvāt by tripadatvāt.” All the manuscript evidence, including the
manuscript H, supports the reading of the rule given above as: idam ūṣvādiṣu
tripadatvāt. Whitney is, however, correct in saying that the rule applies only to

अध्याय ४, पाद ३
604
the krama- text, and that the pada reading of the passages referred to does not
deviate in any manner from the usual norm: we have idam : ūn̐ iti : su, etc.
The term tripada refers to those kramapadas which, by rule 113 = CA \(4.4.14\),
below, are composed of three words, instead of, as usual, two only.
For AV \(18.1.16\), Whitney’s edition agrees with the reading given in
the CAB. However, the VVRI edition gives the reading anyam ū ṣu, while
noting the manuscript variant anya ū ṣu. It should be noted that the reading
anyam ū ṣu is identical with the reading found in RV \(10.10.14\). Thus, one
can surmise that the deviation from the reading given by the CA tradition may
have come about through the influence of the R̥gvedic tradition. All these ex-
amples are cited in the same order in APR \(207a, p. 124\), and the APR reading
for AV \(18.1.16\) agrees with the one found in the CAB. The APR \(207a\) has
one more passage which is not cited by the CAB : pará ū ta ékam \(AV 18.3.7\),
and we do not know whether this passage was intended to be included in this
gaṇa by the CA and the CAB. Also see the Note on CA \(3.1.4\).

Note: Whitney says: “The irregularity which renders necessary the
rule is the retention of the lingual ṇ as final, against the principle of rule iii.89
\(= CA 3.4.21\), above. The last case cited, however, does not belong with the
rest, since the denominative ending, by rule 29, above, is separable only after a
vowel, and we read vr̥ṣaṇyantyāḥ \(vi.9.1\) and vr̥ṣaṇyataḥ \(vi.70.1-3\), without
avagraha : hence there is no ground for restoration.” 

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका605
Whitney’s reasoning about vr̥ṣaṇyantīva is correct only as far as the
Padapāṭha goes. However, in the process of parihāra in the Kramapāṭha, there
can be reinstatement of the original sounds, even when there is no avagraha,
and this has led the commentator to include this example here. Compare the
examples on CA \(4.3.2\). The parihāra ‘repetition with an iti interposed’ be-
comes applicable to the example vr̥ṣaṇyantīva, since the tradition considers this
as a divisible compound of vr̥ṣaṇyantī\+iva, and such divisible compounds are
subject to parihāra in the Kramapāṭha. This is not the case with the other two
examples pointed out by Whitney.

Note: Referring to the cumulative count of the rules mentioned in the
colophon of the manuscript H, Whitney says: “unless rule 53 is to be divided
into two, or unless the copyist’s count is inaccurate, we have lost, somewhere
in the course of the second and third sections, one of the rules of the text.” As
Whitney was to realize after the discovery of a second manuscript: “The resto-
ration of iṅgyavac ca \(after rule 93\), and the reckoning of the introduction to
the chapter as a rule, would make out the number 102, given in A \(= H\) as that
of the rules in the first three sections,” Whitney \(1880: 169\). One must, how-
ever, keep in mind that other manuscripts show inclusion of the initial verses of
the fourth Adhyāya as part of the text of the CA, and hence their counts are
significantly different.

Note: The above passage in the commentary is one of the most diffi-
cult to restore. The lone manuscript H is bad enough, but Whitney occasion-
ally faults it for his own copying errors. For example, the commentary cites
the forms traisūyam \(= pada \) and traiṣūyam. \(= saṃhitā \). Whitney’s note on

अध्याय ४, पाद ४
612
p. 235 says: “Ms., both times, traisūyam.” The photocopy of the Berlin manu-
script which I have in my possession correctly distinguishes between the two
instances of the word, and Whitney’s comment could have been a result of
only his own error in hand-copying the manuscript.
A statement comparable to the present rule is found in APR \(3\): ऋषि-
प्रोक्तमन्त्रादिशब्दस्वरज्ञानार्थः पदविभागः. 
Referring to the reading r̥tubhyas tvā in AV \(3.10.10\), Whitney \(AV
Transl. Vol. I., p. 102\) says: “All the saṃhitā-mss. combine in a -bhyaṣ ṭvā,
and SPP. accepts the reading in his text; ours emends to -bhyas tvā; such
treatment of final as is common in Ppp., and sporadic examples of it are found
among the AV. mss., but it is hardly to be tolerated in a text like ours; and the
comment to Prāt. iv. 107 \(= CA 4.4.7\) quotes the passage as -bhyas tvā.” For
a similar passage in AV \(19.38.4\) and its extensive discussion by Whitney,
see: AV Transl. Vol.II., p. 957.

Note: With the lone manuscript H in his possession, Whitney was un-
able to distinguish the two rules: CA 4.4.8 and CA 4.4.9. He argues that there
must be only one rule, and that one rule is identical with CA 4.4.9 \(= Whitney
iv. 108\). This is, however, proven wrong by all the manuscripts in our pos-
session. Clearly, there are two rules. The first refers to the importance of
studying the Padapāṭha, while the second refers to the importance of studying
the Kramapāṭha. One should study the Padapāṭha in order to strengthen one’s

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका613
control over the Saṃhitā. One should study the Kramapāṭha in order to
strengthen one’s control over both the Padapāṭha and the Saṃhitā. In \(1880:
169\), after the discovery of the second manuscript, Whitney admits that there
must be two rules. He also presents a “somewhat amended” version of the text
of the commentary given above. The manuscript as it stands reads: तत्रापदा-
ध्यायी ... संशयच्छेदनं कुर्यात्. Whitney amends it to: तत्र पदाध्यायी ... संशयच्छेदनं
कुर्यात्. A better way to amend it is: तत्रापदाध्यायी ... संशयच्छेदं न कुर्यात्.
Whitney also amends the manuscript passage वर्णदृढादित्वात् ध्यञ् directly to
Pāṇini 5.1.123: वर्णदृढादिभ्यः ष्यञ् च.  There is no justification to do so. The
passage should be amended simply to: वर्णदृढादित्वात् ष्यञ्, and should be inter-
preted as simply alluding to Pāṇini 5.1.123.

pāṭha.

मन्तरेण विज्ञानं न स्यात्तस्मात्क्रमोऽध्येयः । अधुना तस्य
लक्षणम् । कीदृशोऽसौ क्रम इत्याह ।
Note: The intent of this rule seems to be to say that the Kramapāṭha
has distinct accents as compared to the Padapāṭha and the Saṃhitāpāṭha. This
new accent pattern emerges, because, in the Kramapāṭha, each pada is com-
bined with the next pada, but this duo stands in isolation from the preceding
and the following padas. Thus, the Kramapāṭha creates entirely new prosodic
circumstances producing a distinct accent pattern. Whitney seems to interpret
this statement somewhat differently: “That is to say -- as we are doubtless to
understand it -- in the pada we have before us only the accent of the uncom-
pounded elements; in the saṃhitā, only that of the combined phrase : how the
one grows out of the other is shown by the krama, which gives everything in
both its separate and combined state.”
Referring to the cited example svādv àdmī́ti

\(AV 5.18.7\), Whitney
says: “here, in pada, we have an oxytone and an unaccented syllable, which
form a circumflex, while in the saṃhitā the circumflex farther suffers depres-
sion \(nighāta, the vikampita of our rule iii.65 = CA 3.3.16, above\), and the cir-
cumflex itself only appears in krama \(in svādv àdmi, where the cause of de-
pression of the svarita is not present\).”

Note: Whitney says: “The term antena is explained by avasānena,
‘close, end:’ we might have rather expected the reading antyena, ‘with the last
word of each krama-word as already defined.’” While Whitney’s expectation
is appropriate, it is not supported by a single manuscript of the CA. However,
I have translated the rule as if the word antena was synonymous with antyena.
The CA seems to be using the word anta in the sense of antya in other rules as
well, cf. CA \(1.1.5: पदान्तः पद्यः\), CA \(2.1.2: पदान्तानामनुत्तमानाम् तृतीया ...\), CA
\(3.4.21: पदान्तस्पर्शयुक्तस्य\), CA \(4.3.9: पदान्तविकृतानाम्\).
As an illustration of Krama, Whitney cites the last line of the first hymn
of the AV \(i.1.4 c, d\) and constructs its Krama: saṃ śrutena : śrutena
gamemahi : gamemahi mā : mā śrutena : śrutena vi : vi rādhiṣi : rādhiṣīti
rādhiṣi. Now we have at least one manuscript of Kramapāṭha \(Kāṇḍa 20, ms.
\# 133/1879-80\) and two manuscripts of Jaṭāpāṭha \(Kāṇḍa 15, ms \# 128/1879-
80; Kāṇḍa 17, ms \# 83/1880-81\) available at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research
Institute. With these manuscripts, we can now confirm at least some of the
features of Krama discussed by the CA and the CAB.

Whitney \(4.112\). E, F, I, O: नांतर्गतं°. P: तांतगतं°.
Translation: A word occurring at the end \[of a half-verse,
i.e. first two metrical feet, or at the end of a verse\] is not
\[combined\] with the following \[i.e. the initial word of the third
metrical foot, or the initial word of the next verse\].

र्चान्तगतं परेणार्धर्चादिना पदेन न\(H: म\) सन्धेयम् । द्वे पदे
क्रमपदमित्युक्तम् ।
Note: Each verse is divided into two parts, each followed by a pause.
The first pause occurs at the end of the second metrical foot, and the second
pause occurs at the end of the verse. The present rule says that a Kramapada is
not to be formed across a pause at either of these locations. The final word,
thus occurring before a pause, undergoes a repetition \(parihāra\) by CA
\(4.4.18\). This pattern is now fully confirmed by the BORI manuscript
\(133/1879-80\) containing the Kramapāṭha for the 20th Kāṇḍa. Consider the
first verse of the 20th Kāṇḍa and its Kramapāṭha provided by the manuscript
on its first folio: 
AV \(20.1.1\): इन्द्र॑ त्वा वृष॒भं व॒यं सु॒ते सोमे॑ हवामहे ।
स पा॑हि॒ मध्वो॒ अन्ध॑सः ॥
Kramapāṭha:इन्द्र॑ त्वा । त्वा॒ वृष॒भं । वृ॒ष॒भं व॒यं । व॒यं सु॒ते । सु॒ते सोमे॑ ।

Note: The term apr̥kta also occurs elsewhere in the CA, cf. CA
\(1.3.10: उकारस्येतावपृक्तस्य\) and CA \(1.3.17: निपातोऽपृक्तोऽनाकारः\). See the Note
on CA \(1.3.17\). The commentary offers the example of the triple Krama-
word: dhiyā́\+ā́\+ihi \(AV 2.5.4\). Here, the Krama-sequence, in terms of the
previous rules might have been like: dhiyā́ \(= dhiyā́\+ā́\)/ éhi \(= ā́\+ihi\). The
present rule says that we are supposed to combine all the three words together
into a single Krama-word: dhiyéhi. For Whitney’s comment on dhiyéhi, see
Note on CA \(3.2.15\). 
Whitney further remarks: “It is doubtless to point out and call attention
to this mode of treatment of the ā in the krama-text, that our Atharvan pada
manuscripts quite frequently write a figure 3 after the word which follows it :
thus, in the instance cited, the manuscript gives dhiyā : ā : ihi : 3, at i.1.2, punaḥ
: ā : ihi : 3, etc.”
This pattern of a Tripada in the Kramapāṭha is now confirmed by the
BORI manuscript 133/1879-80. For the initial words for AV \(20.4.1: अ॒यमु॑ त्वा
विचर्षणे॒\), the Kramapāṭha \(folio 2\) reads: अ॒यमु॑त्वा । ऊँ॒ इत्॑यूँ । त्वा॒ वि॒च॒र्ष॒णे॒ ।
Here, the first segment अ॒यमु॑त्वा is a Tripada, with the monophonic middle Pada

Translation: The reasons \[for considering three words com-

the fusion of two vowels into one, combination of vowels,

lengthening of a vowel, and the change of s to ṣ \[after vowels
other than a and ā\].

Note: A good deal of the last portion of the above commentary is still
unclear, though I have now given on the whole a better text than Whitney.
Also, AV \(2.5.4\) presents a more complicated sequence: dhiyā́ / ā́ / ihi / ā́ / naḥ.
It is not clear from the commentary whether it proposes to turn this sequence
into two krama-words: dhiyéhi \(= dhiyā́\+ā́\+ihi\) and ihyā́naḥ \(= ihi\+ā́\+naḥ\).
Whitney remarks: “For the second item, he selects the example ihi : ā : naḥ
\(ii.5.4\) : here, if we compound ihy ā and ā naḥ, a vowel-combination
\(svarasandhi\) is made of the i, by the rule svare nāmino ’ntasthāḥ \(iii.39 = CA
3.2.16\). How this vowel combination furnishes the ground for the krama-
word ihy ā naḥ, he does not point out.” Similarly, referring to the example

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका619
idam ū ṣu, Whitney says: “The prologation of the u in this and similar cases
would indeed seem to furnish a reason for the construction of the krama-word
out of three members, since the long vowel could not properly appear if the
particle were made the final of one such word and the beginning of another; but
I am unable to see how the lingualization of the sibilant should have any effect
in the same direction, since there would be no difficulty in reading u ṣu as a
krama-word, if the u were treated in the ordinary manner.” A more detailed
account of the reasons for combining three or more words into a single Krama-
word is found in the XIth Paṭala of the RPR. For a confirmation of the Tripada
Krama of this type from the BORI Krama manuscript, see the note on the
previous rule.

Note: The wording of the commentary is not quite clear. However,
Whitney says: “This rule is, as the commentator explains it, intended to forbid
the combination of u \(like ā and o\) with the next following word to form a new
krama-word \(anyayoganivr̥ttyarthaḥ\).” The commentary seems to be making
some distinction between anyayoganivr̥tti and ayoganivr̥tti for the particle u. In
technical Sanskrit, these terms are used to explain the meaning of the particle
eva, and hence the first line could be emended to: evakāro ’nyayoganivr̥tty-
arthaḥ. Ayoganivr̥tti may mean “obligatory combination, lit. prohibition on
lack of combination.” For u in B.O.R.I. Krama ms., cf. note on CA 4.4.19.

Note: All manuscripts have the reading antargatānāṃ, and so does the
manuscript of the commentary CAB. Whitney restores it to antagatānāṃ, with-
out reporting the original reading. I agree with Whitney’s restoration, since it
agrees with the practice of parihāra, or parigraha as it is called in the RPR
\(iii.23: परिग्रहे त्वनार्षान्तात् ...\) and sthitopasthita as it is called in the VPR \(4.190,

Note: Whitney provides a comparative view of parihāra in the various
traditions: “The forms to be repeated are, according to the doctrine of he Vāj.
Pr. \(iv.187-193\), a divisible word \(avagr̥hya\), one in the interior of which ap-
pears a prolongation or a lingualization, a pragr̥hya, a riphita of which the r
does not appear in the saṃhitā, and a word preceding a pause \(avasāna\). The
first and the last three of these classes are, indeed, treated in the same manner
by all the other authorities \(compare R. Pr. x.6-8, r. 7-9, and xi. 13-14, r. 25;
Up\(alekhasūtra\) iv. 4-11\); but as regards the words which in saṃhitā undergo
an abnormal alteration of form, there is a less perfect agreement among them.
The Rik. Pr. and Up. specify as requiring repetition in krama \(but sundry spe-
cial and anomalous cases\), words having their initial vowel prolonged, and
those in the interior of which there is a change not brought about by external
influences - that is to say, due to euphonic causes within the word itself.
Whether the Vāj. Pr. includes among the repeatable words those having a pro-
longed initial, or whether any cases of this kind occur in the text to which it
belongs, I do not know. Our own krama-system, it will be noticed, while in
one respect more chary of the repetition than the others, in that it repeats no
riphita words, in another respect is vastly more liberal of its use, applying it in
the case of every word which requires restoration from an abnormal to a nor-
mal form, according to the rules given in the preceding section of this chapter.

अध्याय ४, पाद ४
622
There is no limitation made, either by the text or the commentary, of the term
samāpādya; so far as I can see, every word in the text which undergoes in
saṃhitā any of the changes detailed in rule 74, above, must suffer parihāra.
The Atharvan krama is thus made a more complete and elaborate index of the
euphonic irregularities occurring in its text than is that of either of the other
Vedas.” 
Note that Whitney’s conception of the Kramapāṭha for the AV is purely
inferential, and is not based on either perusal of the manuscripts of the Krama-
pāṭha or its actual recitation. Now the BORI Krama manuscript \(133/1879-80\)
confirms the description given by the CA and the CAB. The parihāra is also
carried out in the Jaṭāpāṭha as shown by the BORI manuscripts 128/1879-80
and 83/1880-81.
४.४.१९. द्वाभ्यामुकारः ।
Whitney \(4.118\). I: 20. O: द्वाध्यांमुकारः.
Translation: \[The parihāra repetition for\] u \[is carried out\]
by \[placing\] two \[iti-s, namely one after each occurrence of u\].
चतुराध्यायीभाष्य - द्वाभ्यामितिकरणाभ्यामुकारः परि-

Note: Whitney points out that this exceptional treatment of u is
unique to the AV tradition: “None of the other treatises supports this reading :
all would prescribe simply ūn̐ ity ūn̐.” In this respect, the BORI Krama
manuscript \(133/1879-80\) does not follow the CA prescription and uses iti
only once. However, the BORI Jaṭāpāṭha manuscript \(128/1879-80, folio 36-
7\) shows the application of the present CA rule: ऊँ॒ इत्यूँ॒ इति॑ \(AV 15.10.6-7\).
Since the Krama manuscript is available only for the 20th Kāṇḍa, the difference
between the treatment of u, may be historically significant. The Krama of the
20th Kāṇḍa may have been influenced more by the RV tradition. The Jaṭā
manuscript, however, shows that the CA rule was indeed followed.

Note: As the commentary points out, CA \(1.3.10: उकारस्येतावपृक्तस्य\)
prescribes that the particle u is nasalized before iti. CA \(1.3.11: दीर्घः प्रगृह्यश्च\)
further says that u is lengthened before iti and that it becomes a pragr̥hya,
namely that it is not combined in sandhi with the following iti. The commen-
tator says that, unless each occurrence of u in the repetition were followed with
iti, it would not be possible to keep it long and nasalized, i.e. as ũ.
४.४.२१. प्लुतश्चाप्लुतवत् ।
Whitney \(4.120\). P adds a daṇḍa after this as a correction.
Translation: A prolated vowel, \[in parihāra repetition\], is
treated like a non-prolated one.

Note: A pluta vowel, like a pragr̥hya, is not combined with the fol-
lowing vowel in sandhi, cf. P.6.1.125 \(प्लुतप्रगृह्या अचि नित्यम्\). Though there is
no specific rule in the CA teaching this feature of a pluta vowel, this seems to
have been taken for granted by the present rule.

अध्याय ४, पाद ४
624
Whitney remarks: “The reading of the manuscript is unfortunately cor-
rupt at the end, where the required Krama is to be given.” The commentary
further confuses the issue by interpreting the word aplutavat as a non-adver-
bial, by paraphrasing it as: सः अप्लुतवता परिहर्तव्यः. Whitney translates this
phrase as: “it \(= protracted a\) must be repeated along with \[or, in the form of\]
an unprotracted a.” In the original rule, the expression aplutavat is adverbial in
the same manner as it is in P.6.1.129 \(अप्लुतवदुपस्थिते\). Pāṇini’s rule makes it
somewhat more transparent that by the term aplutavat we are given permission
to combine a pluta vowel with the following vowel of iti, something which was
otherwise not permitted by P.6.1.125. Thus, the CA rule says that when in the
parihāra repetition, the word babhūvā̃3 is followed by iti, the final ā̃3 is treated
as if it were not pluta, i.e. it is allowed to combine with the following i of iti.
४.४.२२. अनुनासिकः पूर्वश्च शुद्धः ।
Whitney \(4.121\). M: अनुनासिकश्च°. P adds a daṇḍa after this as a cor-
rection.
Translation: \[The vowel, which is seen\] previously \[i.e. in
the Saṃhitā and Pada\] as a nasal \[vowel\], is \[restored to\] a pure
\[i.e. non-nasal, vowel before the iti of a parihāra repetition\].

\(च.आ. ४.४.१२\) इति । तत्र सन्धानविधानं नोक्तम् ।
उच्यते।
Note: Thus, in a parihāra repetition, when babhūvā̃3 is combined
with iti, the previous rule gives us the permission to treat ā̃3 as if it were not a
prolated vowel and hence to combine it with iti. However, even if it were to be
treated as a non-prolated vowel, it would still remain a nasal ā̃, and combined
with the following i, it would yield a nasal ẽ in babhūvẽti. The present rule

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका625
says that the nasal vowel should be first restored to a non-nasal vowel and then
combined with the following vowel. Thus we get the desired form babhūveti.
The full krama repetition reads as: babhūveti babhūvā̃3. CA \(1.3.8\) ensures
that the form babhūva in the phrase puruṣa ā babhūva appears as babhūvā̃3
before a pause.
Whitney’s discussion on this rule is entirely misguided. He seems to
think that the present rule would teach the krama reading babhūveti babhūva,
while CA \(1.3.8\) would have us read babhūveti babhūvā̃3. He, therefore,
says: “It may be, however, that we ought to confess a discordance between the
teachings of our treatise here and in the first chapter.” Whitney is misled to this
conclusion because he gives CA \(4.4.21\) an interpretation which is too wide.
It is not that a pluta vowel is treated as a non-pluta anywhere in the parihāra
repetition, but that it is treated as a non-pluta before iti of the repetition. The
present CA rule applies to the same context, and therefore there is no contra-
diction in our treatise.

Whitney \(4.122\). C, E, F, O: यथाशास्त्रप्र°.
Translation: The combination \[of two successive words into

शौनकीया चतुराध्यायिका627
Note: The words siṣyade and praṇītaye occur at the end of half-verse.
In their krama-parihāra repetition, we are asked to first recite the words as they
are given in the saṃhitā, before reciting the parihāra. Thus we get the se-
quences: siṣyade / sisyada íti sisyade, and práṇītaye / pránītaya íti prá-nītaye.
Whitney says that “this special point is left untouched in all the other krama
treatises.” It is perhaps peculiar to the AV tradition.
The BORI manuscript \(133/1879-80\) of Krama for the 20th Kāṇḍa
shows a slightly different state of affairs. In all the cases of samāpādyas, not
just the ones that occur at the end of half-verses, one finds that the word as
read in the Krama portion is always in its shape as seen in the Saṃhitā, and
only in its parihāra does it show the restoration. For example, the words ह॒र्य॒
पु॒रु॒ष्टु॒त॒ occur at the end of the second Pāda of AV \(20.6.2\). Their Krama in the
manuscript \(folio 3\) reads: ह॒र्य॒ पु॒रु॒ष्टु॒त॒ । पु॒रु॒स्तु॒तेति॑ पुरु°स्तुत. However, the same
treatment is seen in this Krama manuscript for samāpādya words which do not
occur at the end of a half-verse. Compare the Krama \(folio 3\) for the words प्र
णो॑ धि॒तावा॑नं य॒ज्ञं in AV \(20.6.3\) which do not occur at the end of a half verse: प्र
णो॑ । नो॒ धि॒तावा॑नं । धि॒तावा॑नं य॒ज्ञं । धि॒तवा॑न॒मिति॑ धि॒त°वा॑नं. This behavior is differ-
ent from the prescription of the CA and the CAB. The BORI manuscripts
\(128/1879-80; 83/1880-81\) of the Jaṭāpāṭha show the same behavior as seen in
the Krama manuscript. It is not immediately clear how to account for this dif-
ference.

\(source?\)
Note: The phenomenon of āsthāpita takes place only when the trans-
formation which is restored to its original is caused by word-internal causes,
and not by causes in the preceding word. Thus, it applies to the form siṣyade,
because the cerebralization here is caused by the vowel i in the same word. On
the other hand, in the expression anu ṣicyate, the cerebralization is caused by
the preceding u of anu which is treated as a separate word by the Padapāṭha.
Whitney points out: “It might still seem doubtful, after all this lengthy exposi-
tion, whether such a word as sicyate was regarded by the commentator as not
to be separately spoken at all, or as to be separately spoken, only not in saṃhitā
form, as follows: striyām anu : anu ṣicyate : sicyate : sicyata iti sicyate; but the
latter interpretation seems to me the more probable.” The pattern anu ṣicyate :
sicyate : sicyata iti sicyate reconstructed above by Whitney is not met with in
the BORI Krama manuscript. However, we do find different treatment of
word-internal and word-external changes. Contrast the following examples.
After the Krama सु॒षाव॑ हर्यश्व \(AV 20.117.1, folio 78\), we get the parihāra in the
form: सु॒सावेति॑ सु॒साव॑. this instance, the retroflexion is caused by word-
internal conditions. However, we do not get any such parihāra in the example
of AV \(20.113.2, folio 79\): प्र॒थ॒मो नि । नि षी॑दसि । सी॒द॒सि॒ सोम॑कामं. This is not
followed by सीदसीति सीदसि. Since the Padapāṭha treats ni as a separate Pada,
the same treatment is continued in the Kramapāṭha. Once the context of ni is
removed in the Kramapāṭha in a sequence such as सी॒द॒सि॒ सोम॑कामं, the
retroflexion naturally goes away, and there is no need to deliberately go for
another explicit restoration.
The passage निमित्तनैमित्तिकानां भिन्नपदार्थत्वम् in the CAB almost certainly
must be emended to निमित्तनैमित्तिकानां भिन्नपदस्थत्वम्, cf. the CAB on CA 4.4.27.

\(1948, 1964: 286\) refers to this passage and says that the element -kāra
appears to occur for the first with letters of the alphabet in AB \(xxv.7\).
Thus, Kr̥ṣṇadāsa has indeed referred to one of the earliest references to
individual sounds and their combination.

Āraṇyaka \(1.5\) also has a similar passage. For the sources of the Āśva-
lāyanagr̥hyasūtra, see: V.M. Apte \(1940-41\), Vol.III, Nos. 2-7, pp. 5-6.

7It almost looks like the initial Sūtra of the work that Kr̥ṣṇadāsa is commenting
upon. However, no manuscripts of the CA or Kautsa-Vyākaraṇa contain
this as a Sūtra. This is comparable to Mugdhabodha-Vyākaraṇa \(1.1: ॐ नमः
शिवाय\). We may also note that in the region of Maharashtra, the traditional
education of a child began by the words ओनामासीधम्, which is nothing but a
vernacularized form of ॐ नमः सिद्धम्. This practice presumably has its origin
in the Jain tradition. The Marāṭhī Jain work Ādinātha-Purāṇa \(7.95\) says
that the education of a child began with the mantra ॐ नमः सिद्धेभ्यः, and then
the child was introduced to the alphabet \(see: Subhashchandra Akkole, 1968,
p. 209\). The word siddha is associated with the alphabet also in the Kātantra
Vyākaraṇa \(1.1.1: सिद्धो वर्णसमाम्नायः\). The salutation ॐ नमः सिद्धेभ्यः also
occurs at the beginning of the Kātantrarūpamālāvyākaraṇa \(p. 1\). It is not
clear whether it is part of the original text, or something added by the editor.
In any case, the connection with Jain traditions is unmistakable, because the
editor views Śarvavarman, the author of the Kātantra-Vyākaraṇa, to be a
Jain, and Bhāvasena Traividyadeva, the author of the Kātantrarūpamālā, is
indeed a Jain author.
8This statement is interpreted in two opposite ways by different traditions.
Generally, the later grammarians interpret it to mean that the Saṃhitāpāṭha is
the source of the Padapāṭha, in the sense that the words given as separate
items in the Padapāṭha are isolated from the Saṃhitā. This view is found in
the commentary of Puṇyarāja on Vākyapadīya \(2.1-2\). The reverse inter-
pretation is generally found in the Prātiśākhya tradition which believes that
the Saṃhitāpāṭha is produced by applying the rules of sandhi to the isolated
words given in the Padapāṭha, and hence the latter is the source of the
former. This is stated clearly by Uvaṭa in his commentary on RPR \(2.1\):

contrast with the view of Puṇyarāja mentioned above, Cardona \(1991: 129\)
has argued that “Pāṇini fits right in with a long tradition of considering the
padapāṭha the source text by means of which the saṃhitāpāṭha and recitations
such as the kramapāṭha are accounted for.” Kr̥ṣṇadāsa seems to be within
this latter view.
9There is a certain ambiguity about the actual extent of the sections referred to
here as sandhisādhana and svarasādhana, since these terms are not used
again in the text. For instance, does the word sandhisādhana refer to the
preliminaries of the sandhi section, or does it refer to all the sandhi sections
taken together? Similarly, does the word svarasādhana refer to vowel-sandhi
section, later referred to as svarasandhi, or does it refer to accents? The verse
that follows would perhaps support a view that sandhisādhana referred to all
sandhi sections taken together, and that the word svarasādhana was equal to
svarajñāna in the sense of treatment of accents. However, the text as we
have it does not have any systematic treatment of accents.

11The inclusion of all svaras among kaṇṭhya sounds is inexplicable. Contrast:
SK on P.1.1.9 \(p. 4\): अकुहविसर्जनीयानां कण्ठः । However, after PS 4, below,
Kr̥ṣṇadāsa says: तत्र नामिस्वराणां प्रत्येकं स्थानद्वयम्, namely 
that the nāmin
vowels, i.e. vowels other than a and ā each have two points of articulation.
This probably means that he seriously believes that all vowels are minimally
kaṇṭhya, and some may have an additional point of articulation. No other
text on Sanskrit grammar or phonetics entertains such a notion.
12This refers to the notion that the sound h is an aurasya ‘pulmonary’ when it
is combined with nasals and semi-vowels, but it is kaṇṭhya ‘glottal’ when
uncombined. This is conveyed by the Pāṇinīyaśikṣā \(verse 16\): हकारं पञ्चमै-
र्युक्तमन्तःस्थाभिश्च संयुतम् । औरस्यं तं विजानीयात्कण्ठ्यमाहुरसंयुतम् ॥
13This view is imported from the late Pāṇinian commentators
14The text of the CA actually makes no reference to anusvāra. The general
view is that the CA does not have the notion of anusvāra, and that it accepts
only the nasalized vowels.

17Kr̥ṣṇadāsa offers no real interpretation for this rule, unless somehow his
comment is taken to mean that the first and the final members of the series are
called sparśas. Even this does not make any sense. The rule is actually meant
to say that, among all the sparśas, the first and the final members can occur
word-finally \(padya\).
18This interpretation is substantially far off from what the original rule is
supposed to mean. See the other commentaries and notes on CA \(1.1.10\).
Also note that Kr̥ṣṇadāsa has split the original rule into two separate rules:
PS 14 and 17.
19The rule CA \(1.1.9\) is actually an exception to CA \(1.1.8 = PS 13\), and
means that members of the c-series do not occur word-finally. Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s
paraphrase does not bring out this meaning. It seems to say: “It is not the
case that the purpose of the/a varga is everywhere the same.” I am not quite
sure what he intends to say.

23One may perhaps justify the exclusion of r̥, r̥̄, and l̥ from this listing, because
these vowels contain consonantal constituents, but the inclusion of aṃ and aḥ
among vowels makes no sense. The author is misled by the fact that in most
traditional mātr̥kā alphabets, aṃ and aḥ follow the vowels. This is the way
the sounds named anusvāra \(= ṃ\) and visarga \(= ḥ\) are traditionally cited, cf.
VPR \(8.21: अं इत्यनुस्वारः\) and VPR \(8.22: अः इति विसर्जनीयः\). Perhaps, the
author is influenced by the Tāntric view of Sanskrit alphabet, which often in-
cluded these two sounds among vowels. For a detailed exposition of the
Tantrik view, see: Rāmājñā Pandey \(1986: 26, 38, 48\).
24From this citation, it is clear that Kr̥ṣṇadāsa does not interpret PS 22 \(= CA
1.1.31\) to mean that the effort for the spirants is īṣad-vivr̥ta. For further
discussion, see the notes on CA \(1.1.31\).
25The original CA rule \(1.1.34\) was simply एकारौकारयोर्विवृततमम्, but it was
expanded in certain sub-schools to एकारौकारयोर्विवृततरम् ऐकारौकारयोर्विवृत-
तमम्।  See the notes on CA \(1.1.34\)..
26Compare: विवृतमनूद्य संवृतोऽनेन विधीयते । SK on P.8.4.68, p. 5. Kr̥ṣṇadāsa
would have us believe that the CA had open \(vivr̥ta\) short a in the deriva-
tional process, but the present rule, like P.8.4.68 \(अ अ\), reinstates the close
\(saṃvr̥ta\) a in the usable utterance. There is no reason to believe that the CA
had any such notion. The rule here is a straight forward description that
short a is a close sound. Pāṇini needed to make an adjustment of this sort to
have the sounds a and ā become savarṇa ‘homogeneous’ with each other by
P.1.1.9 \(तुल्यास्यप्रयत्नं सवर्णम्\). The original CA does not have any such defini-
tion of the term savarṇa, and hence does not need such an accommodation.

28This is a somewhat cryptic remark. It is not clear what Kr̥ṣṇadāsa finds
common between a diphthong and a particle. It is possible that nipātavat is a
scribal error for nipātanavat. A nipātana is a word which is approved as a
whole, without making any effort to separate its constituents. Thus, a nipā-
tana may be viewed as a word which has seeming parts, but is treated as if it
is partless. Similarly, a diphthong has parts, and yet it is treated as a single
sound \(ekavarṇavat\).
29As far as I can make sense of this comment, Kr̥ṣṇadāsa is proposing that CA
\(1.1.41\) be given two readings a\) na ekāra-okārayoḥ, and b\) na aikāra-
aukārayoḥ. Both the readings, after sandhi, lead to the same text: naikārau-
kārayoḥ. For further discussion, see notes on CA \(1.1.41\).
30Commenting on P.1.1.10 \(नाज्झलौ\), Bhaṭṭojī Dīkṣita splits this rule as na\+ā\+
ac\+halau, instead of what would normally be na\+ac\+halau. The insertion of ā
in the rule here is termed ākārapraśleṣa. See: ‘नाज्झला’विति निषेधो यद्यप्याक्षर-
समाम्नायिकानामेव तथापि हकारस्याऽऽकारो न सवर्णः, तत्राऽऽकारस्यापि प्रश्लिष्टत्वात् ।
तेन विश्वपाभिरित्यत्र ‘हो ढ’ इति ढत्वं न भवति । SK on P.1.1.69, p. 6.
31The rule P.1.3.3 \(हलन्त्यम्\) is traditionally given two interpretations, by repeat-
ing it twice. For details, see: Deshpande \(1975: 41-42\).
32While the SK on P.8.2.1 \(p. 5\) offers an eleven-fold division of the bāhya-
prayatnas, Kr̥ṣṇadāsa here focuses upon only four of them. Perhaps, the
other kinds of bāhyaprayatnas are viewed as being not relevant in the context
of the sandhis he discusses. He does not deal with the interaction of accents
in sandhis.

33These verses are not found in the standard versions of Pāṇinīyaśikṣā, but are
cited in the SK on P.8.2.1 \(p. 5\). The commentary Tattvabodhinī on these
verses says that the external efforts were listed in verses by someone for
easier comprehension: बालबोधनाय बाह्यप्रयत्नाः कैश्चित्सुगमोपायेनोपनिबद्धाः। Tattva-
bodhinī on SK on P.8.2.1 \(p. 5\).
34What follows is quite clearly not a nādalakṣaṇa ‘definition of nāda.’ For
better interpretations, see notes on CA \(1.2.3\).
35Compare: बाह्यप्रयत्नाश्च यद्यपि सवर्णसंज्ञायामनुपयुक्तास्तथाप्यान्तरतम्यपरीक्षायामुपयोक्ष्यन्त

36Compare: इति स्थानप्रयत्नविवेकः । SK on P.8.2.1 \(p. 6\).
37This is an interesting formulation. Wherever Pāṇini refers to the views of
other grammarians by citing their names, he probably intends to refer to
dialectal variation in Sanskrit. On the other hand, Kātyāyana and Patañjali
interpret such references as being no more than indications of options. For a
detailed consideration of this question, see: Deshpande \(1978\).
38Compare Kātyāyana’s Vārttika: वर्णात्कारः on P.3.3.108. The marker sound Ṭ
in the affix kāraṬ is intriguing. It is not clear what it was intended for in the
system from which this statement is cited.

39This is probably a citation of Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa \(1.1, p. 1\). Pāṇini does
not use the term samāna, but the Prātiśākhyas use the term samāna or
samānākṣara to refer to simple vowels.
40This concern as to why the sounds listed as samānas do not undergo sandhi
in the very listing is analogous to the concern expressed by the Pāṇinian
grammarians about the sound-listing in the Śivasūtras. Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s explana-
tion is very similar to the explanation found in the commentary Tattva-
bodhinī on SK \(pp. 1-2\): वर्णानामसंदिग्धत्वेन बोधनाय संहिताया अविवक्षणादेतेष्वसंधिः।
स्वराणां चादिषु पाठात् ‘चादयोऽसत्त्वे’ इति निपातसंज्ञायां ‘निपात एकाजनाङ्’ इति प्रगृह्य-
त्वे प्रकृतिभावान्न संधिरित्यन्ये । The Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa \(p. 1\) also expresses
the same conclusion, though it offers a different reason for it: नैतेषु सूत्रेषु
संधिरनुसंधेयोऽविवक्षितत्वात् । It looks like Kr̥ṣṇadāsa cites the rule from the
Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa, but derives the explanation for the absence of sandhi
from Pāṇinian commentators.
41The term samāna is normally interpreted to mean a simple vowel. Here,
Kr̥ṣṇadāsa takes it in the sense of ‘equal.’ In what sense are the five simple
vowels equal? This question is answered by saying that each of them has
eighteen types of manifestations due to the distinctions of length \(3\), nasality
\(2\), and accents \(3\). This is generally not conceded for l̥, which is
traditionally said to have short and prolated varieties, but no long varieties.
42There is no such rule in CA. However, compare P.8.2.100 \(अनुदात्तं प्रश्नान्ता-
भिपूजितयोः\) and P.8.2.105 \(अनन्त्यस्यापि प्रश्नाख्यानयोः\). It is not clear where
such additional rules in Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s works are coming from.

पाठ इदानीं परिभ्रष्टः, तथापि वृत्तिकारादिव्यवहारबलेन यथाकार्यं प्राक् स्थित इत्यनुमीयत
इति ।
44The CA rule says that consonants also have one-mora duration. Kr̥ṣṇadāsa
tries to change the meaning of this rule to match the citation which says that
consonants have a half-mora duration.
45This seems to be a reference to the commonly cited verse: एकमात्रो भवेद् ह्रस्वो
द्विमात्रो दीर्घ उच्यते । त्रिमात्रस्तु प्लुतो ज्ञेयो व्यञ्जनं चार्धमात्रकम् ॥ This is not
found in any version of the Pāṇinīyaśikṣā. It is cited in the Sārasvata-
Vyākaraṇa \(p. 2\).
46This is a significant comment. While the CA defines the terms laghu and
guru, there is no occasion within the system of CA to purposefully use these
terms. In contrast, Pāṇini’s grammar finds purposeful utilization of this
distinction, e.g. P.8.2.86 \(गुरोरनृतोऽनन्त्यस्याप्येकैकस्य प्राचाम्\) and P.7.2.7 \(अतो
हलादेर्लघोः\). It is not clear why Kr̥ṣṇadāsa feels compelled to include these
rules.
47This verse is also cited with the same reading in Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s Vr̥tti

on CA \(1.2.12\). For a discussion of the different readings of this verse, see
the note on CA \(1.2.12\).
48The phrase ekakālāvacchedena is somewhat strange in this context. It nor-
mally means, ‘within the same time-span.’ In a rooster-call, we here different
lengths of u successively, and normally one would not expect the use of the
above phrase. 
49The notion that Pāṇini chose the vowel u to demonstrate the different dura-
tions of short, long, and prolated vowels, because this is naturally seen in the
call of a rooster \(kukkuṭa\), is explicitly stated in the works of Nāgeśabhaṭta.
The Br̥hacchabdenduśekhara \(vol.I., p. 28\) says: कुक्कुटरुते उकार एव एक-
मात्रत्वद्विमात्रत्वादीनां प्रसिद्धेरकारादयो नोक्ताः सूत्रकारेण । The same comment in
found in Nāgeśabhaṭṭa’s Laghuśabdenduśekhara \(p. 82\).
50Kr̥ṣṇadāsa takes the term yama to be equivalent of vowel-length. The term
actually refers to ‘range of vowel pitch, register.’ For details, see the note on
CA \(1.1.16\).

51If the phrase तत्समानत्वं न is used simply to point to the fact that the
diphthongs have only twelve varieties each, and therefore they are not equal
in regard to the number of varieties with the preceding vowels, this makes
sense. However, Kr̥ṣṇadāsa is simultaneously attempting to explain why
these sounds are not included in the category of samāna vowels. Elsewhere,
he attempts to explain the technical term samāna for simple vowels by
pointing out that they are samāna ‘equal’ in each having 18 varieties. See his
commentary on PS 34: समानत्वं किम् । ह्रस्वदीर्घप्लुतानुनासिकाननुनासिकोदात्तानुदात्त-
स्वरितभेदेन प्रत्येकमेते पञ्च स्वरा अष्टादशधा तुल्यं धर्मं प्राप्नुवन्ति ।
52This is most likely a reference to the notion that e and o are vivr̥tatara, while
ai and au are vivr̥tatama. See PS rules 25, 59 and 60 below. For a detailed
discussion, see the note on CA \(1.1.34\).
53This is an unusual explanation of the term sandhyakṣara and is not supported
by any other text.
54This looks like a direct reflection of the Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa \(1.4, p. 2\): ४
उभये स्वराः । अकारादयः पञ्च, एकारादयश्चत्वारश्चोभये स्वरा उच्यन्ते ।

56The original CA rules 3.3.26-7 appear in the context of a discussion of
whether consonants have accents \(svara\). Kr̥ṣṇadāsa, perhaps under the
influence of the cited Sārasvata-Vyākarana statement, takes the term svara to
refer to vowels, rather than to accents.
57This interpretation of saṃyoga as conjunction with a vowel is not supported
by any text in Sanskrit grammar or phonetics.
58This definition is inaccurate, because it does not exclude ā from the scope of
the term nāmin. The vowel ā is not saṃvr̥ta, and yet it must be excluded from
the scope of the term nāmin.
59The term nāmin has nothing to do with nāman, as alleged by Kr̥ṣṇadāsa. It is
derived from the causative form namayati in the sense of ‘to bring about
change.’ See: K.C. Chatterji \(1948, 1964\).
60This rule is interpreted in the Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa as: अवर्णवर्जाः स्वराः नामिन
उच्यन्ते । This properly excludes both a and ā from the scope of nāmin, since
both of them are covered by the term avarṇa.
61The wording of this rule is indeed intriguing, unless the word karaṇa is used
in the sense of prayatna ‘effort, manner,’ and not in the sense of ‘articulator.’
The possibility that Kr̥ṣṇadāsa means prayatna by the term karaṇa is en-
hanced by his gloss on PS 20 \(= CA 1.1.29\) above, where the term karaṇa is
glossed by prayatna. This would make this definition identical with that
offered by Pāṇini 1.1.9 \(तुल्यास्यप्रयत्नं सवर्णम्\). If the term karaṇa were to mean
‘articulator,’ there are very few parallels in the grammatical literature. One

Also compare the definition given in VPR \(1.13\): समानस्थानकरणास्यप्रयत्नः सवर्णः
which uses the notion of karaṇa besides āsyaprayatna. For a detailed discus-
sion of issues involved, see: Deshpande \(1975: 94ff, 104ff, and 118-119\).
62This is indeed a very unlikely interpretation. It is difficult to see how one can
extract all the listed vowels, i.e. a, i, e, ai, u, o, and au, including all the short,
long, and extra long varieties from the expression naikāraukārayoḥ. Also it
is difficult to see how the rule can be additionally made to say that vowels are
not homogeneous with consonants. Bhārgava-Bhāskara’s commentary also
offers a different, but an equally unlikely explanation. See the notes on CA
\(1.1.41\).
63Identical with Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa \(1.19, p. 4\).
64The Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa does not extend the analogy of mitravat to
pratyayas. This may be Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s innovation. The behavior shared by the
augments and affixes is that they are both add-on elements, and do not re-
place anything.
65Identical with Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa \(1.20, p. 4\). Kshitish Chandra Chatterji

67PS rule 59 and the commentary exclude a from the list of guṇa vowels, cf.
P.1.1.2 \(अदेङ् गुणः\). The featural description vivr̥tatara can apply to e and o
within the system as understood by Kr̥ṣṇadāsa, but not to a, which is a close
\(saṃvr̥ta\) vowel.
68This rule and the commentary presumably try to lump ai, au, and ā together
as vivr̥tatama vowels. The CA \(1.1.34-35\) distinguish between the degree of
openness for ai and au on the one hand, and ā on the other. The vowel ā is
treated by the CA as being even more open than ai and au, which are
described as vivr̥tatama.
69Also compare: ते विभक्तयन्ताः पदम्, न्यायसूत्र, २.२.५१.
70Compare Yāska’s Nirukta \(1.9\): अथ ये प्रवृत्तेऽर्थेऽमिताक्षरेषु ग्रन्थेषु वाक्यपूरणा आग-
च्छन्ति पदपूरणास्ते मिताक्षरेष्वनर्थकाः कमीमिद्विति. The same list is referred to in
Br̥haddevatā \(2.91\) which explicitly refers to these items as nipātas in \(2.89\).
71While the nipātas cited here have one vowel each \(ekasvarāḥ\), it is not exactly
clear why this qualification has been mentioned here. It almost seems like a
reflex of the words nipāta ekāc of P.1.1.14 \(निपात एकाजनाङ्\).
72The wording of Kr̥ṣṇadāsa is confusing at best. The Nirukta \(1.9\) and
Br̥haddevatā \(2.90-91\) say that the nipātas like kam, īm, it, and u are mean-
ingless \(anarthakāḥ\), but that “there are also such particles as have various
senses \(anekārthāḥ\), e.g. iva, na, cid, and nu - these are the four having the
sense of comparison” \(Br̥haddevatā 2.91\).
73Compare Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa \(355, p. 75\): प्रादिरुपसर्गः, and the list of Upa-
sargas begins with pra, parā etc.

75Compare Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa \(26, p. 5\): अन्त्यस्वरादिष्टिः ।
76This rule and the next one, interestingly offer a graphic, rather than a
phonetic, description of the Anusvāra and the Visarga. Compare Sārasvata-
Vyākaraṇa \(32, p. 4\): वर्णशिरोबिन्दुरनुस्वारः । The Pāṇinian grammarians gener-
ally do not offer graphic descriptions of sounds. However, occasionally this
does happen. For jihvāmūlīya and upadhmānīya sounds, the SK on P.8.2.1
\(p. 6\) says: ᳲकᳲपाविति कपाभ्यां प्रागर्धविसर्गसदृशौ जिह्वामूलीयोपध्मानीयौ। Commen-
ting on this line, the Tattvabodhinī says: सादृश्यमुच्चारणे लेखने च बोध्यम् ।
77This looks like an effort to combine Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa \(122: अविभक्ति नाम\)
with the Pāṇinian term prātipadika for the nominal stem, cf. P.1.2.45
\(अर्थवदधातुरप्रत्ययः प्रातिपदिकम्\). The commentary excludes nipātas and upa-
sargas from the scope of this term. This is not the case with Pāṇinian rules.

It appears that this exclusion is to make this rule compatible with the Prāti-
śākhya tradition which distinguishes nominal stems from the categories of
nipāta and upasarga, cf. CA \(1.1.2: चतुर्णां पदजातानां नामाख्यातोपसर्गनिपातानां
सन्ध्यपद्यौ गुणौ प्रातिज्ञम्\). For further details, see: Deshpande \(1992: 10-15\).
78This looks like an incomplete expression, since the plural of sarvādīni does
not match the singular of sarvanāma. Compare P.1.1.27 \(सर्वादीनि सर्वनामानि\).
However, the singular usage is more in accordance with Sārasvata-
Vyākaraṇa \(148: सर्वादेः स्मट्\) and सर्वादिः सर्वनामाख्यः in a verse cited in the
Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa \(p. 23\).

82Compare P.1.1.66 \(तस्मिन्निति निर्दिष्टे पूर्वस्य\).
83Compare P.1.1.46 \(आद्यन्तौ टकितौ\). The rule as stated by Kr̥ṣṇadāsa refers to
ṭa-varga and ka-varga, rather than just the marker consonants ṭ and k.
84The term apratyayaḥ in P.1.1.69 \(अणुदित्सवर्णस्य चाप्रत्ययः\) is interpreted by
Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita in his SK on this rule as being equal to avidhīyamānaḥ. This
is interpreted to mean that an item which is prescribed is not capable of
representing its homogeneous sounds. Historically, such an interpretation
goes back to the MB of Patañjali who derives the maxim भाव्यमानेन सवर्णानां
ग्रहणं न.  For a detailed discussion of this maxim, see: Deshpande \(1975:

71ff\). This notion manifests in different grammars as a distinct rule, and the
rule विधायकस्य न in Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s work is in all likelihood a statement
expressing this notion. Compare Bhoja’s Sarasvatīkaṇṭhābharaṇa, rule 1.2.4
\(अविधीयमानोऽण् ससवर्णः\). 
85Compare: Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa \(p. 6\): वर्णग्रहणे सवर्णग्रहणम् ।
86While the reading here is corrupt, the component asaha may be compared
with the expression kevala in Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa \(p. 6\): कारग्रहणे केवल-
ग्रहणम्. The rule probably means: “A letter appended with the affix -kāra does
not stand for the associated sounds, i.e. stands just for itself.”
87This statement probably belongs to the next section, introducing rule PS 96.
88I am not sure about this section. The text says earlier that there is a section
titled sandhisādhanam between the paribhāṣā section and the svarasandhi or
svarasādhana section. However, it is strange to find just two rules, without
any indication of the beginning or the end of the section.
89Compare the graphic description of repha found in the Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa

90In the stage abh-bh-y \+ āgataḥ, Kr̥ṣṇadāsa argues that one may suspect that y
is followed by a sasthāna ‘homorganic’ vowel ā, and then deny reduplication
to y by PS 103. This argument is based on several assumptions. The first
assumption is that the substitute y can be treated as having the same features
as the original i, cf. sthānivadbhāva in Pāṇini, which, however, contains the
restriction analvidhau in P.1.1.56. Even if y is treated as having the same
features as i, how can it be treated as being sasthāna ‘homorganic’ with ā?
This cannot happen in any other system, except the one set up by Kr̥ṣṇadāsa.
He, on PS 2, argues that all vowels are minimally kaṇṭhya, and that vowels
other than a and ā may have a second point of articulation, cf.
स्वरहकारविसर्जनीयानां कण्ठः and नामिस्वराणां प्रत्येकं स्थानद्वयम्. This allows the
possibility of i and ā being treated as sasthāna. No other system of grammar
known to me would support such a position.

91Contrast the more standard interpretations of CA \(2.1.20\). The rule applies
to a situation where an uttama ‘list-final’ nasal consonant is followed by one
of the first four members \(= non-list-final\) of the stop-series. Under no
circumstances can the rule apply to the sequence b-bh-y-y.
92The rule does not say that the consonant under consideration is deleted
according to Śākaṭāyana, but that it has a reduced articulation. P.8.3.18
\(व्योर्लघुप्रयत्नतरः शाकटायनस्य\) and P.8.3.19 \(लोपः शाकल्यस्य\) clearly distinguish
between these alternatives. The deletion alternative is ascribed to Śākalya.
93Kr̥ṣṇadāsa implies that this rule of Pāṇini also applies to phonology, so that a
sequence of two identical consonants could be reduced to a single consonant.
The original context of the rule does not have anything to do with phonology.
94Compare Cāndravyākaraṇa \(36: स्वरहीनं परेण संयोज्यम्\) and Kātantravyākaraṇa
\(1.1.21: व्यञ्जनमस्वरं परं वर्णं नयेत्\).
95This repeats the view that P.1.2.64 \(सरूपाणामेकशेष एकविभक्तौ\) teaches that a
cluster of two identical consonants can be reduced to a single consonant.
96Compare the SK on P.8.2.23, referring to the sandhi of sudhī\+upāsyaḥ :

98This probably refers to the two possible forms pittrājyam and pitrājyam.
99The etymologies of the words raṇa and rāvaṇa are intriguing. 
100Generally, the word lavanaṃ is derived from the verb lu plus the affix ana,
and not from a combination of l̥\+avana. The Pāṇinian commentators look at
lavaṇa as an irregular formation sanctioned by its inclusion in the nandyādi-
gaṇa, cf. P.3.1.134 \(नन्दिग्रहिपचादिभ्यो ल्युणिन्यचः\), and the SK \(p. 488\) on this
rule: नन्द्यादिगणे निपातनाण्णत्वम्.

101Here the term pratyaya is used in the sense of a substitute \(ādeśa\), and not in
the sense of an affix. K.C. Chatterji \(1948, 1964: 91ff\) surveys the various
meanings of this term in the grammatical literature, but has not found any
usage of the term in the sense of substitute.
102The question of why the y and v at the end of the substitutes ay, av, āy, and
āv are not deleted is of importance even in the Pāṇinian system, cf. SK on
P.6.1.78 \(एचोऽयवायावः\) and P.1.3.9 \(तस्य लोपः\) इति यवयोर्लोपो न । उच्चारण-
सामर्थ्यात् । एवं चेत्संज्ञापीह न भवति ।
103This assumes a derivation from dhau\+aka. Such a possibility occurs even in
the Pāṇinian system which prescribes the substitute dhau for the verb root sr̥,

: गोर्यूतौ छन्दस्युपसङ्ख्यानम् and अध्वपरिमाणे च on P.6.1.79. What distinguishes
Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s statement is that there is some notion of a half and a full a. As
the following discussion shows, he assumes that in the formation gavyam, at
the stage go\+ya, there is a reduced a as an end-augment after go, i.e. goa\+ya.
The reduced a allows the change of go to gav. The reduced a is like the
svarabhakti. This is a distinctive interpretation, and differs significantly from
Pāṇini’s procedure in P.6.1.79 \(वान्तो यि प्रत्यये\), which prescribes the change
of go to gav before a y-initial affix. It may perhaps indicate occasional tri-
syllabic pronunciation of words like gavyam and nāvyam in the AV tradition.
Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik, Vol.I., p. 201ff. discusses the vari-
ation of the suffixal elements -ya and -iya. However, the tradition here may
indicate a different, more a-like pronunciation of the initial vocalic element,
e.g. gavaya rather than gaviya. While the original CA does not have this
view, Kr̥ṣṇadāsa is certainly citing this from some as yet unknown source.
105The manuscript K uses the ligature अ् to indicate the half or reduced a \(akā-
rārdha\).
106The term ardham here again refers to the notion of akārārdham which has
been explained in the notes above.

107Compare P.6.1.85 \(अन्तादिवच्च\).
108This statement is not very clear, but seems to refer to the possible homo-
geneity of r and r̥ on the one hand, and r̥ and l̥ on the other.
109This interpretation strays substantially from the intent of CA \(3.2.15\). PS
126 \(= CA 3.2.19\) specifically says that the combination of two similar
simple vowels results in a long vowel, and there is no reason to suspect that
it could become a prolonged \(pluta\) vowel.

the examples sīmantaḥ, manīṣā, and patañjali indicates a close relationship to
the SK on P.1.1.64 \(p. 21\). Also see Prakriyākaumudī of Rāmacandra \(Vol.
I, p. 64\) on P.6.1.94 for the same examples. The final comment is even more
closely comparable to the Prauḍhamanoramā on SK \(p. 194\): केचित्तु मनःपत-
च्छब्दयोः पृषोदरादित्वादन्त्यलोपेऽकारस्यैव पररूपमाहुः । It is clear that Bhaṭṭoji refers
to this view as a rejected view, and this is made clear by Haridīkṣita in his
commentary Laghuśabdaratna : अत्रारुचिबीजं तु वचनद्वयव्यापारो व्यर्थः, पृषोदरादि-
त्वाट्टिलोपेनैव सिद्धेरिति ।. N.D. Wadegaonkar, in his Marathi translation of
Prauḍhamanoramā and Śabdaratna \(Vol. 3, pp. 132-3\), identifies the view
being rejected as that of Śrīkr̥ṣṇapaṇḍita, the author of the commentary
Prakāśa on Rāmacandra’s Prakriyākaumudī. Śrīkr̥ṣṇapaṇḍita \(Prakāśa on
Prakriyākaumudī, Vol.I., p. 112\) says: सीम्नोऽन्तः नलोपेऽतः पररूपं केशवेश एव ।
... मनस ईषा । असः पररूपं पृषोदरादित्वात्सलोपेऽकारस्य वा । ... पतञ्जलिरिति ...

अन्ये तु पततीति पत इत्यजन्तेन पतशब्देन विग्रह्याकारस्य पररूपमाहुः । The modern
Sanskrit commentary Raśmi on Prakāśa by the editor Muralīdharamiśra
explains \(p. 112\): पतञ्जलिरित्यत्र पृषोदरादित्वादन्त्यलोपे पश्चात्पररूपम् । टेः पररूप-
मितिपक्षेऽच्छब्दस्य । It seems that Kr̥ṣṇadāsa is citing the view of Śrīkr̥ṣṇa-
paṇḍita. The Bhaṭṭoji tradition prefers the derivation of the word patañjali
from patita\+añjali \(= añjaleḥ patitaḥ\), rather than from patan\+anjali. The com-
mentary Sadāśivabhaṭṭīya on Nāgeśa’s Laghuśabdenduśekhara \(p.302-3\)
points out that Nāgeśa prefers the former derivation, and casts aside the latter
which was offered by a grammarian referred to as Ratnākara: एतेन पतन्नञ्जले-
रिति विगृह्णन् रत्नाकरः कटाक्षितो, लडर्थस्य बाधात् । For earlier explanations of the
words manīṣā and manīṣita along the lines of Prakāśa, see Mallinātha’s com-
mentary on Kumārasambhava \(1.28 and 5.4\). I am grateful to Cardona for
providing the reference to Mallinātha.

113The doctrine of the homogeneity of r̥ and l̥ was first proposed by Kātyāyana
in his Vārttika : ऋऌकारयोः सवर्णविधिः, MB \(MLBD edn., Vol.I, Sec.I., p.
158\). For a detailed analysis of this doctrine, see: Deshpande \(1975: 25ff\).
114It is not clear why the example pitr̥bhakta and its variations are offered here.
The example does not involve a combination of a final r̥ with an initial r̥,
resulting into a long vowel.
115I have not found any clear indication like this in the rules of Piṅgala’s
Chandaḥsūtra, except that sūtra \(1.9: gr̥l\) uses the syllable gr̥ as an instance
of a light \(l = laghu\), indicating at the least that r̥ is looked upon as a vowel
and as a light vowel.
116This refers to the graphic behavior of r. It also indicates a phase of the
grammatical tradition when the practitioners could not keep apart the oral
language from the written language. The present description applies to a
word like निर्ऋति. There may be some truth to this argument, in the sense that
those who practiced this form of writing may have been influenced by the
consonant-initial pronunciation of r̥ as ri or ru.
117The words gor ak refer to PS 119 above. It is not clear why this rule is
brought into this discussion of r̥ here.

118This statement draws an interesting contrast between vaidika and sautra. It
says that examples like pitr̥̄ṇam and mātr̥̄tuḥ are not attested in Vedic texts,
but are found only in illustrating rules of grammar. I think the word sautra is
used here not in the sense of ‘occurring in the sūtra,’ but in the broad sense
of ‘illustrating the rules of grammar.’ One may, however, note that this
simultaneously admits that such expressions are not found in the classical
language either. One needs to consider the possibility whether the conso-
nant-initial pronunciation of r̥ as ri or ru makes it resistant to this type of
sandhi in actual usage.
119This also refers to PS 119 above which, among other things, prescribes the
augment aK to the word go before the word indra, i.e. go\+a\+indra >
gav\+a\+indra > gava\+indra > gavendra.
120This statement is deemed necessary because the original CA rules do not
provide for the change of a\+l̥ to al. For similar issues in the Pāṇinian system,
see Deshpande \(1975: 24-25\).

121The argument assumes that the replacement ār for -a\+r̥- can be treated as
occurring at the end of the previous word or at the beginning of the following
word, cf. PS 124-125 above.
122The source of this statement can be ultimately traced to the Vārttikas \(प्रवत्स-
तरकम्बलवसनानां चर्णे\) and \(ऋणदशाभ्यां च\) on P. 6.1.89. While the KV keeps
these two as separate statements, they are combined by the Prakriyākaumudī
on P.6.1.89 into प्रवत्सतरवत्सरकम्बलवसनदशानामृणे and SK on P.6.1.89 into
प्रवत्सतरकम्बलवसनदशानामृणे. Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s rule seems to be a modification of the
SK statement. It does not include the word vatsara which is found in the
formulation of the Prakriyākaumudī. Apparently, it was included in the
Prakriyākaumudī on the basis of its inclusion by Durga in his commentary
on the Kātantravyākaraṇa, cf. Prakāśa on Prakriyākaumudī \(Vol.I., p. 109\).
The word pra is not included in Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s formulation as given by the
manuscript K. However, the citation of the example prārṇam suggests that it
was included in his original formulation.
123Compare: SK on P.6.1.89 \(p. 20\): दशार्णो देशः । नदी च दशार्णा । ऋणशब्दो
दुर्गभूमौ जले च ।
124Compare P.6.1.92 \(वा सुप्यापिशलेः\). It seems like the reference to Āpiśali was
omitted by Kr̥ṣṇadāsa, as it was grammatically deemed to be unnecesary, cf.
SK on P.6.1.92: आपिशलिग्रहणं पूजार्थम् । At the beginning of his Saṃjñā-
prakaraṇa, Kr̥ṣṇadāsa says: आचार्यनाम्नो विभाषा ज्ञेया. Since P.6.1.92 already
contains the word vā, the reference to Āpiśali providing another indication of
option was clearly deemed to be unnecessary. For an extensive treatment of
this general question, see: Deshpande \(1978\). 
125Compare Kātyāyana’s Vārttika \(ऋते च तृतीयासमासे\) on P.6.1.89.

128Compare the Vārttika \(एवे चानियोगे\) on P.6.1.94. Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s commentary
seems to derive its examples from the KV and SK on this Vārttika.
129Compare the Vārttika \(स्वादीरेरिणोः\) on P.6.1.89. Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s commentary
follows the SK on P.6.1.89 \(p. 19\): स्वेनेरितुं शीलमस्येति स्वैरी स्वैरिणी च ।
130Kr̥ṣṇadāsa says that in the combination sva\+īra, the ī of īra first changes to e
and then through the pararūpa sandhi in sva\+era, one gets svaira. None of
this makes any sense. The rule actually says that in the combination sva\+īra
the single substitute for a\+ī is a vr̥ddhi, i.e. ai, rather than the usual e.
131These examples are found in the Prakriyākaumudī and SK on P.6.1.88.

132The source for this rule is the Vārttika \(अक्षादूहिन्याम्\) on P.6.1.89, which
Patañjali expands as: अक्षादूहिन्यां वृद्धिर्वक्तव्या. While the Prakriyākaumudī offers
the example simply as akṣauhiṇī, Bhaṭṭoji’s SK on P.6.1.89 \(p. 19\) reads:
akṣauhiṇī senā.
133This goes back to the Vārttika \(प्रादूहोढोढ्येषैष्येषु\) on P.6.1.89. Kr̥ṣṇadāsa
seems to have excised the forms īṣa and īṣya, because they are separately
considered earlier.
134This is not covered by PS 146, but relates to the element ūṭh mentioned in
P.6.1.89 \(एत्येधत्यूठ्सु\), and the example praṣṭhauhaḥ is the standard example
in the KV and the SK. In praṣṭha\+ūha, the element ūha is derived from the
causative of the root vah, by the replacement of the initial va with ū \(= ūṬH\)
by P.6.4.132 \(वाह ऊठ्\).
135The passage beginning with guṇe seems to be based on SK on P.6.1.94 \(p.
20\): एङि पररूपम् । आदुपसर्गादेङादौ धातौ परे पररूपमेकादेशः स्यात् । ... उपोषति ।
इह वा सुपीत्यनुवर्त्य वाक्यभेदेन व्याख्येयम् । तेन एङादौ सुब्धातौ वा । ... प्रोघीयति ।
प्रौघीयति ।
136This is identical with the Vārttika \(ओत्वोष्ठयोः समासे वा\) on P.6.1.94. The
examples sthūlautuḥ and bimbauṣṭhī are found in the MB on this Vārttika.
The example of a non-compounded sequence tavauṣṭhaḥ is found in the com-
mentary Prakāśa on Prakriyākaumudī \(Vol.I., p. 111\), as well as in the SK on
P.1.1.64 \(p. 21\). All three are found in the Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa \(64, p. 11\).
137This is identical with P.6.1.95.
138The SK and the Prakriyākaumudī on P.6.1.95 offer the example śivāyoṃ
namaḥ. The example adyom seems to have come from the Sārasvata-
Vyākaraṇa \(54, p. 10\).
139In this case, the SK and the Prakriyāprakāśa on P.6.1.95, and the Sārasvata-

Vyākaraṇa \(54, p. 10\) offer the example śiva\+ā\+ihi > śivehi. Perhaps, as a
devout Vaiṣṇava, Kr̥ṣṇadāsa changed it to rāmehi.

the SK on P.6.1.109 \(एङः पदान्तादति\).

गोअग्रम् । गोऽग्रम् ।
142It is not clear whether Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s rule प्रकृत्या वा was meant to cover the
additional example te atra. The example te\+atra changing to te ’tra is offered
by the Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa \(51, p. 9\). The example te atra as an example of
prakr̥tibhāva could possibly come under प्रकृत्या वा to make up the syllables of
a metrical line in Vedic, cf. P.6.1.115 \(प्रकृत्यान्तःपादमव्यपरे\). The other possi-
blity is that the example te atra is misplaced here and actually is supposed to
go with PS 151 below as an example of an uncombinable dual form \(pra-
gr̥hya\).

143This formulation offers perhaps the best explanation why CA \(1.3.12\) uses
the expression saptamyarthe, rather than considering forms like gaurī below
as irregular locatives. There was apparently a tradition of viewing these as
being non-locative forms with locative meaning. For additional discussion,
see notes on CA \(1.3.12\). Bhaṭṭoji has a different view of these examples,
cf. SK on P.1.1.19 \(p. 26\): ‘सुपां सुलुक्’ इति सप्तम्या लुक्.
144The expression pratiyoge is parallel to adhiyoge in PS 155. However, the
example cited, i.e. मामकी तनू, is not an example of prati, but of adhi. The full
citations from Paippalāda \(6.6.8\) reads: अध्यस्यां मामकी तनू.  The word āviśeti
in Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s commentary makes one wonder if he thought of the citation
as मामकी तनू आविश. However, I have not been able to trace such a passage.
145Both the examples and the counter-example are found in the KV and the SK
on P.1.1.19.

171This is a misreading for पदान्तानामनुत्तमानाम्. The misreading must go back to
the text as it was received by Kr̥ṣṇadāsa. It has led him to come up with an
uncommon interpretation of the term uttama under PS 198 and 199 below.
172The rule actually means to say that among the members of the five stop
series, the firsts \(prathama\) and the lasts \(uttama\) in each series can occur at
the end of words \(padya\). Kr̥ṣṇadāsa thinks that the rule says that the first
members \(prathama\) of the series are also called uttama. This is clearly
inaccurate. However, he is forced to launch into this unlikely meaning for
the word uttama, because of the wrong reading he inherited for his rule PS
197 \(= CA 2.1.2\). The correct CA reading for this rule is पदान्तानामनुत्तमानाम्,
while Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s received reading is पदान्तानामुत्तमानाम्. On rule PS 201
below, Kr̥ṣṇadāsa acknowledges that such an interpretation of the term
uttama is quite uncommon: इतरथा तु पञ्चमवर्णस्यैवोत्तमत्वं दृश्यते ।
173For a more accurate interpretation of this rule, see the notes on CA \(1.1.10\).

174The examples offered here show voicing of voiceless stops before voiced
consonants and vowels, e.g. vāk\+yajñaḥ > vāgyajñaḥ. These can be treated
as examples of CA \(2.1.2 = PS 197-8\) above. The expression jalayantram is
not an example, but looks like an explanation of the meaning of the example
abyantram.
175This example does not fit the description एवं द्वितीयवर्णेषु.
176This example also does not fit the description एवं द्वितीयवर्णेषु.
177The original CA rule \(2.1.5\) is not an optional rule. Kr̥ṣṇadāsa offers the
optional interpretation most probably under the influence of the optional rule
in Pāṇini, cf. P.8.4.45 \(यरोऽनुनासिकेऽनुनासिको वा\). See the notes on CA \(2.1.
5\).
178The yavādigaṇa is referred to in P.8.2.9 \(मादुपधायाश्च मतोर्वोऽयवादिभ्यः\).
Kr̥ṣṇadāsa makes an interesting observation that the word kakud is listed in
this gaṇa with a final d, and hence this d is preserved in the formation
kakudmān and not changed to kakunmān. One may note that the word kakud
is listed in the yavādigaṇa as listed in the SK \(p.728\). The argument of
Kr̥ṣṇadāsa is based directly on Bhaṭṭoji’s SK on P.8.4.45 \(pp. 28-29\): कथं

तर्हि ‘मदोदग्राः ककुद्मन्त’ इति । यवादिगणे दकारनिपातनात्. The exact significance
of this comment in the SK is debated by the commentaries on the SK.
Nāgeśabhaṭṭa argues that this statement of Bhaṭṭoji is based on the view that
the yavādigaṇa lists not just the word kakud, but the whole expression
kakudmān, cf. Laghuśabdenduśekhara \(p. 356\): यवादिगणे ककुद्मानिति प्रकृति-
प्रत्ययसमुदायः पठ्यते इति मतेनेदम्. The Prauḍhamanoramā on P.8.4.45 seems
to back away from the interpretation offered in the SK and offers another
alternative.
179While the CAB on this rule restricts this rule to non-nasal stops, तेभ्यः
पदान्तेभ्यः अनुत्तमेभ्यः, Kr̥ṣṇadāsa extends it to cover the nasals. Also see the
example nyaṅ\+hāsaḥ > nyaṅghāsaḥ below. P.8.4.62 \(झयो होऽन्यतरस्याम्\)
excludes the nasals.
180Some of these examples as given by the manuscript K seem to be impos-
sible: godhugh-ghariḥ, ajh-jhīnam, ṣaḍh-ḍhastaḥ, and kakubh-bhāraḥ. The
retention of the voiced aspirate stop before a voiced aspirate stop goes against
all rules, cf. CA \(1.4.3: सोष्मणि पूर्वस्यानूष्मा\). For further discussion, see the
notes on CA \(1.4.3\).

181The optionality of this statement is derived probably from the fact that this
view is historically ascribed to the grammarian Pauṣkarasādi in Kātyāyana’s
Vārttika cited below.
182Cf. चयो द्वितीयाः शरि पौष्करसादेः, Vārttika 3 on P.8.4.48 \(नादिन्याक्रोशे पुत्रस्य\).
This Vārttika is cited in the SK under P.8.3.28 \(p. 30\).
183Many of the forms as cited in the manuscript here are impossible forms, e.g.
ākaṅkkhṣaṣṭhaḥ. It is perhaps possible that this is a shortform method of
referring to a pair of forms such as ākaṅkṣaṣṭhaḥ / ākaṅkhṣaṣṭhaḥ.
184The examples involving the word hasta as the second member seem to
indicate a certain confusion. The rules given above do not speak of the inser-
tion of k, ṭ, t etc. before h. CA \(2.1.9\) explicitly says śaṣaseṣu, which is
identical in its scope to śari in P.8.3.28 \(ङ्णोः कुक्टुक् शरि\) and in the Vārttika
: चयो द्वितीयाः शरि पौष्करसादेः on P.8.4.48. In contrast with this, PS 210
\(ङणनेभ्य ऊष्मसु प्रथमानां द्वितीया वा\) uses the term ūṣman which is inclusive of
h. Kr̥ṣṇadāsa makes this clear by rendering the word ūṣmasu by śaṣasaheṣu.
This extension to h is not supported by any traditions of grammar or pho-
netics. Also note that the change of h to a voiced aspirate stop is prescribed
only before non-nasals. In P.8.4.62 \(झयो होऽन्यतरस्याम्\), the shortform jhaY
excludes the nasals. Also CA \(2.1.7: तेभ्यः पूर्वचतुर्थो हकारस्य\) is interpreted by
the CAB in a way that excludes the nasals, i.e. तेभ्यः पदान्तेभ्यः अनुत्तमेभ्यः पूर्व-
चतुर्थो हकारस्य. On the other hand, Kr̥ṣṇadāsa on PS 207 \(= CA 2.1.7\)
clearly extends this rule to include the nasals: तेभ्यो वर्गाक्षरेभ्यः \(including
nasals\). He offers the example nyaṅ\+hāsaḥ > nyaṅghāsaḥ. This is also not
supported by any other traditions. It looks like an analogical extension.

186There is no way of deriving such a form either in the CA system, or in the
Pāṇinian system. However, a form ut-th-thānam is derivable within the Pāṇi-
nian system. P.8.4.61 \(उदः स्थास्तम्भोः पूर्वस्य\) does not prescribe the deletion
of the initial s of the roots sthā and stambh, but the change of s to a sound
homogeneous with the preceding, i.e. th. There is an option of deleting this
th, but if one chooses not to delete it, then we are told that it must remain a th,
and cannot be deaspirated, cf. SK on P.8.4.61, \(p. 29\): अत्राघोषस्य महाप्राणस्य
सस्य तादृश एव थकारः । तस्य ‘झरो झरि’ इति पाक्षिको लोपः । लोपाभावपक्षे तु
थकारस्यैव श्रवणं न तु ‘खरि च’ इति चर्त्वम् । चर्त्वं प्रति थकारस्यासिद्धत्वात् ।
However, this gives us the form ut-th-thānam, and not the form uth-thānam
as it appears in the manuscript.
187The CAB does not have the condition ह्रस्वानुनासिकस्वरात् परं चेत्, and there is

no basis for it either in the CA rules, or in Pāṇini.
188Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s commentary on PS 222 does not explicitly use the qualification
padāntāḥ for ṅaṇanāḥ as is used by the CAB on CA \(3.2.2\). However, it is
clear from the counter-example vr̥trahaṇau that Kr̥ṣṇadāsa intends such a
qualification.
189This reading is supported by several manuscripts, while others support the
reading छकारश्च.
190This interpretation cannot be correct, since it does not apply to the word
pippalī itself. For further discussion, see the notes on CA \(3.2.5\). It is clear
that Kr̥ṣṇadāsa is looking for a way to get rules parallel to P.6.1.75 \(दीर्घात्\)
and P.6.1.76 \(पदान्ताद्वा\). However, such a meaning cannot be extracted from
PS 224 = CA \(3.2.5\).
191Compare P.8.3.23 \(मोऽनुस्वारः\). However, there is a difference in the way
Kr̥ṣṇadāsa interprets this rule. He takes it as an unconditional rule, while the
Pāṇinian commentators say that a word-final m changes to an anusvāra
before a consonant, cf. SK on P.8.3.23 \(p. 29\): मान्तस्य पदस्यानुस्वारः स्याद्धलि ।
However, Kr̥ṣṇadāsa may have derived his notion of unconditionality of the
word-final m from some non-Pāṇinian systems. The Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa
\(94: अवसाने वा\) prescribes optional anusvāra for a prepausal m, and it \(p. 15\)
further says: कौमारास्त्ववसानेऽप्यनुस्वारमिच्छन्ति । I do not find a rule like this in
the Bibliotheca Indica edition of the Kātantra-Vyākaraṇa, though the
Kātantrarūpamālāvyākaraṇa of Bhāvasena Traividyadeva has the rule \(92, p.
16\) विरामे वा. Finally, we should note that the CA does not use the term anu-
svāra, and does not seem to recognize anusvāra as a nasal element added after
a non-nasal vowel.

192There is no such rule either in CA or in Pāṇini. However, compare
Sārasvata-vyākaraṇa \(101: मः स्वरे\).
193The forms such as kĩyhyaḥ are difficult to justify. Kr̥ṣṇadāsa says that after
the deletion of m in kim\+hyaḥ, the vowel preceding the m is nasalized, and
then the initial consonant of the cluster is doubled yielding kĩyhyaḥ. Clearly,
the initial consonant of the cluster is h, and not y. Thus, it seems obvious
that Kr̥ṣṇadāsa is misled by the late Indo-Aryan metathesized pronunciation
of all old h-initial clusters. Thus, Kr̥ṣṇadāsa is implicitly thinking of the
forms pronounced as kĩyyhaḥ, kĩvvhalayati, kĩllhādayati, and kĩnnhute.
According to Pāṇini 8.3.26-27 \(हे मपरे वा, नपरे नः\), the word-final m can be
retained as m before hm, and can b e changed to n before hn. A Vārttika of
Kātyāyana on P.8.3.26 reads यवलपरे यवला वा. This is taken to mean that a
word-final m can be changed to ỹ, ṽ, and l̃, before hy, hv, and hl, respective-
ly. However, this would provide the forms to be officially viewed as
kiỹhyaḥ, kiṽhvalayati, kil̃hlādayati, and kinhute. Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s error points to
the fact as to how the changes occurring in the phonology of Sanskrit under
the influence of MIA and NIA languages were beginning to confuse the
grammarians. For the causation of these changes, see: Deshpande, \(1983\).

194This is the sound called nāsikya or raṅga in the various texts. This sound is
described as a pure nasal sound, with the complete blockage of the oral track.
It involves the same sort of velar closure as involved in g, but then without
releasing this closure and letting the air pass through the oral track, the air is
expelled forcefully through the nasal passage. Neither Pāṇini, nor the CA
provide for this sound. However, Kr̥ṣṇadāsa provides for it, probably under
the influence of the Sārasvatavyākaraṇa \(102, p. 16\): ँ् छन्दसि । अनुस्वारश्

195This is an intriguing comment. In the original CA system, CA \(2.1.33\)
applies to m, and CA \(2.1.34\) applies to n. Kr̥ṣṇadāsa seems to assume that
both the rules basically apply to n, and are extended to m, on the basis of the
word ca in CA 2.1.34. Such an interpretation may have been prompted by
the analogy of P.8.4.24 \(नश्चापदान्तस्य झलि\). The SK on this rule \(p. 29\)
reads: नस्य मस्य चापदान्तस्य झल्यनुस्वारः स्यात् । यशांसि । आक्रंस्यते ।  Kr̥ṣṇadāsa
in fact seems to have borrowed the same examples.

196The significance of this comment is not clear. None of the Śikṣās or
Prātiśākhyas explain how and why the notion of sphoṭana is particularly
useful in the Kramapāṭha and at the end of each metrical line \(pādānta\). It is
possible that the word pādānta here is simply an error for padānta.
197The reference to dvitva or doubling is not immediately explicable. The CA
rule \(2.1.25\) itself has no such context. It seems most probable that Kr̥ṣṇa-
dāsa is referring to doubling of the kind discussed by Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita in the
context of the form saṃskartā, cf. SK on P. 8.3.34 \(p. 31\).
198The word puṃkṣīra is excluded from the scope of PS 237 \(= CA 2.1.25\) by
the condition anūṣmapare, since the voiceless stop k is followed here by the
spirant \(ūṣman\) ṣ. The example puṃkhyānam is an interesting case. To fit
this case in the exclusion anūṣmapare in CA \(2.1.25\), Kr̥ṣṇadāsa would like
to claim that the voiceless aspirate stops also come under the term ūṣman, and
are therefore excluded. This blurs the distinction between ūṣman and
soṣman, and also fudges the interpretation of anūṣmapare. That phrase in its
own context refers to ‘before a voiceless stop which is not followed by an
ūṣman.’ Thus, it will not apply to the case of kh in any case. To exclude the
case of puṃkhyānam, Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita cites an apocryphal Vārttika : khyāñ-
ādeśe na, cf. SK on P.8.3.6 \(p. 32\). This Vārttika is not found in the MB or
the KV. It probably goes back to the comment ख्याधातौ नेति केचित् in the
Prakriyākaumudī on P.8.3.4 \(Vol.I., p. 155\). Referring to this phrase,
Śrīkr̥ṣṇa remarks in his Prakāśa \(ibid, p. 158\): केचिदिति । भाष्यकारादन्य इति
व्याचक्षते । ... तस्मात्परमताभिप्रायेणैवेदमुक्तं न सिद्धार्थ इत्येवं युक्तमालोचयामः । For
further discussion on these examples, see the notes on CA \(2.1.25\).

optional rule. There are good grounds for doing it. For example, note
Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita’s comment in his SK on P.6.1.138 \(p. 414\): संपूर्वस्य क्वचिद-
भूषणेऽपि सुट् । ‘संस्कृतं भक्षाः’ इति ज्ञापकात् । Another point to note is that the
KV reading for P.6.1.137 is सम्परिभ्यां करोतौ भूषणे, and could be a probable
source for Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s reading. The KV also notes: संपूर्वस्य क्वचिदभूषणेऽपि
सुडिष्यते संस्कृतमन्नमिति । The word kvacit is used by both the KV and the SK.
200Kr̥ṣṇadāsa seems to derive the word saṃkara from sam\+karoti, and
accounts for it by saying that there is absence of the insertion of s because of
the provision of kvacit. Other grammarians preferred to derive this word
from sam\+kirati and derived words like saṃkr̥ti on another basis, cf.
Cāndravyākaraṇa \(on rule 5.1.136, Vol.II., p. 155\): संकृतिरिति गर्गादिपाठात्
सिद्धम् । सङ्कारः सङ्कर इति किरतेर्घञपौ बहुलाधिकारात् ।
201The CAB on CA \(2.1.34\) interprets it in such a way that it applies only
word-internally \(अन्तःपदे\). If that interpretation is valid, then the rule will not
apply to the cases of external sandhi cited by Kr̥ṣṇadāsa.
202The two final examples are probably taken from the SK on P.8.3.7 \(p. 32\)
203The two initial examples are probably taken from the SK on P.8.3.7 \(p. 32\):

Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita juxtaposes these two rules and offers the example nr̥̄̃ᳲpāhi.
205Compare P.8.3.11 \(स्वतवान्पायौ\).
206The CAB offers a somewhat different interpretation of rule CA \(2.2.3: नाम्यु-
पधस्य रेफः\): नाम्युपधस्य विसर्जनीयस्य स्वरे परतः रेफो भवति । This rule is given in
Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s work as PS 268.  However, the identical looking rule given
here is not CA \(2.2.3\), but the initial portion of CA \(2.1.29\) नाम्युपधस्य रेफ
ऋतूँत्सृजते वशीत्येवमादीनाम्. As noted under CA \(2.1.29\), a significant number
of manuscripts place a daṇḍa after rephaḥ in this rule, suggesting that this is a
separate rule. Thus, this may not be a new initiative on the part of Kr̥ṣṇa-
dāsa.
207This is just an expanded version of CA \(2.2.2: स्वरे यकारः\).
208It should be noted that while the CA and the CAB do not betray any famili-
arity with the 19th and the 20th Kāṇḍa of the ŚAV, Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s example
occurs in the 20th Kāṇḍa. However, it is also found in RV \(1.12.3a\).

209This is just an expansion of CA \(2.2.16: आकारोपधस्य लोपः\).
210This may not be an independent rule, but a part of the explanation of PS
256. Compare घोषवति परतः in the CAB on CA \(2.2.16\).
211This probably refers to PS 229 = CA 1.3.5: नकारमकारयोर्लोपे पूर्वस्यानुनासिकः.
212The CA system does not provide such an option. However, Kr̥ṣṇadāsa is
probably referring to the option of having either vr̥kṣān or vr̥kṣā̃. before
vimr̥śa. The CA is far more specific. See the notes on CA \(2.1.28\).
213This shows an effort to patch two different points of articulation for k, i.e.
kaṇṭha vs jihvāmūla. It looks like Kr̥ṣṇadāsa feels some concern as to how
the visarga could change to a jihvāmūlīya before a kaṇṭhya k.
214This refers to the pronunciation of jihvāmūlīya. The sounds upadhmānīya
and jihvāmūlīya are referred to as ardhavisargasadr̥śa in the SK on P.8.2.1
\(p. 6\): ᳲकᳲपाविति कपाभ्यां प्रागर्धविसर्गसदृशौ जिह्वामूलीयोपध्मानीयौ । Bhaṭṭoji’s
own commentary Prauḍhamanoramā \(p. 50\) explains that this halfway simi-
larity between the visarga and these two sounds is based both on their pro-

Kr̥ṣṇadāsa’s notion that there is an option may have been derived from the
Pāṇinian system. P.8.3.45 \(नित्यं समासेऽनुत्तरपदस्थस्य\) prescribes obligatory
cerebralization in compounds, while P.8.3.44 \(इसुसोः सामर्थ्ये\) is traditionally
interpreted in such a way that even when there is no compounding, there can
be optional cerebralization, if there is semantic-syntactic connection between
the constituents of an expression. See the SK on P.8.3.44 \(p. 34\): एतयोर्विस-
र्जनीयस्य षः स्याद्वा कुप्वोः । ... सामर्थ्यमिह व्यपेक्षा ।. It should also be noted that
Kr̥ṣṇadāsa has offered only the examples of compounded expressions. The
condition असमासेऽपि demands that one offer examples of uncompounded
expressions as well. See the notes on CA \(2.3.4\).
230This refers to CA \(2.4.1: अत्र नाम्युपधस्य षकारः\).
231Compare P.8.3.38 \(सोऽपदादौ\).
232The manuscript K smears this segment with yellow color, indicating that this
is a rule. It may either be a corrupt repetition of the preceding, or perhaps an
example of the preceding rule. See the CAB on CA \(2.3.7\) for the example
tatas pari.
233This cannot be an example of CA \(2.3.10\), unless it is taken out of its origi-
nal context. See the CAB on CA \(2.3.10\).
234The rule PS 294 \(= CA 2.3.11\) has something to do with the expression yas
patiḥ, and nothing to do with the forms goṣpade and goṣpatiḥ. Kr̥ṣṇadāsa has
evidently misunderstood the rule. See the notes on CA \(2.3.11\).

235This expression cannot be an example of PS 297 \(= CA 2.3.14\). The
kaskādigaṇa lists the expression bhrātuṣputraḥ. The example pituḥputraḥ as
an aluk-compound, in the sense of पितुरन्तेवासी, is cited under P.6.3.23 \(ऋतो
विद्यायोनिसम्बन्धेभ्यः\) in the KV.
236The examples हरिर्गच्छति and भानुरायातु cannot be treated as examples of a
rephaprakr̥ti type.
237This looks like an unrelated intrusion.
238This example is cited in the SK \(p. 37\) under P.8.2.69 \(रोऽसुपि\) to illustrate
the Vārttika \(अहरादीनां पत्यादिषु वा रेफः\).
239Compare the Vārttika \(अहरादीनां पत्यादिषु वा रेफः\) cited by the SK on
P.8.2.69. It originates in the MB statement अहरादीनां पत्यादिषूपसंख्यानं कर्तव्यम्
on P.8.2.70, which is not given as a Vārttika by Kielhorn, but is treated as
such by the KV and the SK. The examples aharpatiḥ and gīrpatiḥ go back to
the MB on P.8.2.70, and are found in the later commentaries. The example
dhūḥsu / dhūrṣu is not related to this rule.
240This reading for CA \(2.2.7\) is found in a number of manuscripts, though the
example ajarghāḥ has nothing to do with this rule. See the notes on CA
\(2.2.7\).

242All these verses, beginning with सैष दाशरथी ... etc. are cited from the
Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa. They occur in the commentary on Sārasvata-
Vyākaraṇa \(1.118-9, pp. 17-8\). I have corrected the text as given in the
manuscript K by using the Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa. Especially, note the corrupt
reading सेंमा भूम्पाददे which is now corrected to सेमां भूम्याददे. The expression
semām refers to the irregular sandhi of saḥ\+imām. The expression bhūmy-
ādade refers to the irregular sandhi of bhūmiḥ\+ādade. The expression soṣām

243This is significant in that it indicates that Kr̥ṣṇadāsa had probably composed
further sections of this work. However, I was not able to find any manu-
scripts of these portions.

The manuscript was received by the Vaidika Saṃśodhana Maṇḍala, Pune,
from the Gore family of Sangli in southern Maharashtra. However, it
appears that the manuscript was copied most probably in Gujarat by a person
named Ātmārāma Tivāḍi.
