      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/12/26/on-the-vedic-anusvara/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The shaunaka, mAnDukya, pANini and other authorities have declared that&#xA;the anusvAra ‘M’ in its original state is a voiced sound involving only&#xA;the nAsika and no other oral articulation (e.g. anusvAra yamAnAM cha&#xA;nAsikA sthAnaM uchyate |). This differentiates it from the other&#xA;anunAsikas such as ‘ma’, ‘na’ Na, ‘~na’, ‘~Na’ which are sounds with&#xA;specific oral articulations that are tinged with passage of air through&#xA;the nasal cavity. In the pure anusvAra the mouth is kept naturally&#xA;closed without forming any particular articulation and the air is&#xA;allowed to pass, superficially contacting the oral cavity into the nasal&#xA;cavity. However, it does not pass into the oral cavity to resonate&#xA;within it. In English this approximated by the sound value of ‘n’ in&#xA;saint. In practical vedic recitation there are certain complexities in&#xA;the actual sound values taken.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Regarding the 1st, I know some people have special views &amp;amp; get hot like wood being drilled on hearing this; so don&amp;rsquo;t @ me. However, posting my view here since more than one person asked in the past few days. Yes, there are regional peculiarities of recitations &amp;amp; substratal effects (particularly strong in some kali~Nga traditions). However, I don&amp;rsquo;t think these are serious differences. Looking at the totality of the surviving traditions it may be said, broadly there was one ancestral recitational mode that has 2 variants:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
