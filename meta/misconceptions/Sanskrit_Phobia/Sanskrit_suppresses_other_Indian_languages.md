title = "Sanskrit suppresses other (Indian) languages"

+++
- Some languages have an oppressor - oppressed relationship. Eg: Arabic vs Egyptian. English vs Iniut. Though Sanskrit was a link language across Asia,this was not the case with Sanskrit and other languages. Rather, their relationship was of the nourisher-nourished type.

## Enrichment of other languages
- Sanskrit enriched local languages - with its special ability to coin new words.
  - A grateful acknowledgement of influence on Thai - [YTTh2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWp-xyBxWQg).
  - Sanskrit enrichment of telugu - [IF15](http://indiafacts.co.in/samskrutandhramulu-a-symphony-down-the-ages/).
- Works were composed for the study of Prakrits and apabhraMsha-s in Sanskrit (of course, with an intention of \*preserving\* the prAkrits and their treasures). Examples: Hemachandra's 8th chapter, kAshmIra-shabdAnushAsanam, etc..
- Ancient local language poets acknowledged their debt to sanskrit and sanskrit literature.
  - Reasons why southern poets used sanskrit included - gravity, amplification, resonance, clarity, brevity, intertextual reference (depth), phono-aesthetics (   [DS_YT](https://youtu.be/qXfkDk4fGeY?t=2778)  )
  - Again and again, the Tamil shaiva saints speak of how shiva revealed truth in Aariyam and Tamil. [1](http://www.thevaaram.org/thirumurai_1/songview_en.php?thiru=10&Song_idField=10103&padhi=%20&startLimit=8&limitPerPage=1&sortBy=&sortOrder=DESC), [2](http://thevaaram.org/thirumurai_1/songview.php?Song_idField=50180&limitPerPage=1&padhi=018&sortBy=&sortOrder=DESC&startLimit=3&thiru=5), [3](http://thevaaram.org/en/thirumurai_1/songview.php?thiru=11&Song_idField=11033&padhi=040&startLimit=72&limitPerPage=1&sortBy=&sortOrder=DESC&Submit=Please+go)
- It is not the case that the substratum of India when Vedic Indo Aryans arrived was draviDian ( [DS_YT](https://youtu.be/qXfkDk4fGeY?t=2778) ).

### Grammar impact
Tolkappiyar, the author of Tolkappiyam Tamil grammar, says he is well versed in Aindram, ie, Aindram School of sanskrit grammar.
 
> Oldest malayalam grammar book is called lilatilakam and belongs to 14th century. It calls the language itself as manipravalam. So no one can say that it is unaffected by sanskrit.


## Sanskrit also borrows
- Linguists say that Sanskrit \*borrowed\* from as well as lent words to other languages (a hallmark of living languages).
- Sanskritization is often involved in the process of borrowing.
  - This involves coining newer more Sanskrit words that sound similar to the alien word.
    - Eg. sultan → सुरत्राणः chocolate→ चाकलेहः mughal → मौद्गल। (Hammira-kaavya)
  - Inspiration is drawn from the nirukta and the uNAdi sUtra-s of grammar tolegitimizethe use of these new words.
- In classical sanskrit aesthetic works (eg: rAjashekhara) the poet is esteemed by his ability to compose in Sanskrit as well as prakrits; and aesthetic quality is considered to be not-very language-dependent. Most examples of very high-quality poetry (dvani-kAvya) in Sanskrit works came from Prakrit, even if the author chose Sanskrit examples for mediocre and poor poetry!!
- In south India there works composed in a mixture of Sanskrit and the local language (eg: maNipravaLa).

### Examples
- Borrowed words from farsi - कलम। दीनार। (both used by kShemendra)
- Borrowed from prAkRta-s .
  - भर्ता (Sanskrit) → भट्टा (Prakrit) → भट्ट (Later sanskrit - kShemendra). Similarly, (gRha, geha) and (mUDha, mugdha).
  - kumarIla bhaTTa seems to have argued how words like pika come from prAkRtas.
