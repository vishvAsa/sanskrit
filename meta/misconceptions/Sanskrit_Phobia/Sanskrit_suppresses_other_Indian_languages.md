title = "Sanskrit suppresses other (Indian) languages"

+++
- Some languages have an oppressor - oppressed relationship. Eg: Arabic vs Egyptian. English vs Iniut.Though Sanskrit was a link languageacrossAsia,this was not the case with Sanskrit and other languages. Rather, their relationship was of the nourisher-nourished type.
- Ancient local language poets acknowledged their debt to sanskrit and sanskrit literature.
    - Again and again, the Tamil shaiva saints speak of how shiva revealed truth in Aariyam and Tamil.

- Linguists say that Sanskrit \*borrowed\* from as well as lentwordsto other languages (a hallmark of living languages).
    - Sanskritization is often involved in the process of borrowing.
        - This involves coining newer more Sanskrit words that sound similar to the alien word.
            - Eg. sultan → सुरत्राणः chocolate→ चाकलेहः mughal → मौद्गल। (Hammira-kaavya)
        - Inspiration is drawn from the nirukta and the uNAdi sUtra-s of grammar tolegitimizethe use of these new words.
    - Examples
        - Borrowed words from farsi - कलम। दीनार। (both used by kShemendra)
        - Borrowed from prAkRta-s .
            - भर्ता (Sanskrit) → भट्टा (Prakrit) → भट्ट (Later sanskrit - kShemendra). Similarly, (gRha, geha) and (mUDha, mugdha).
            - kumarIla bhaTTa seems to have argued how words like pika come from prAkRtas.

- In classical sanskrit aesthetic works (eg: rAjashekhara) the poet is esteemed by his ability to compose in Sanskrit as well as prakrits; and aesthetic quality is considered to be not-very language-dependent. Most examples of very high-quality poetry (dvani-kAvya) in Sanskrit works came from Prakrit, even if the author chose Sanskrit examples for mediocre and poor poetry!!
- In south India there works composed in a mixture of Sanskrit and the local language (eg: maNipravaLa).
- Sanskrit enriched local languages - with its special ability to coin new words.
    - A grateful acknowledgement of influence on Thai - [YTTh2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWp-xyBxWQg).
    - Sanskrit enrichment of telugu - [IF15](http://indiafacts.co.in/samskrutandhramulu-a-symphony-down-the-ages/).
- Works were composed for the study of Prakrits and apabhraMsha-s in Sanskrit (of course, with an intention of \*preserving\* the prAkrits and their treasures). Examples: Hemachandra's 8th chapter, kAshmIra-shabdAnushAsanam, etc..
