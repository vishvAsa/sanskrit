## Some limited decline
- [Q15](https://www.quora.com/Why-isnt-sanskrit-used-anymore).

## Lay use
- Despite contrary socio-economic forces, it is vitally alive. For numbers, see[this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21msg/bvparishat/QFqoGrD-KrA/R8NvUSDoWwsJ).
- Just search Youtube for Sanskrit videos - even omitting ancient hymns, you will find a lot.
- "Sanskrit villages" -
    - mattUru [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0I8h5oCbrQ).
- Interesting account of sanskrit use from the perspective of western academics, with references: [NLL](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=23412).

## Thriving literary scene and scholarship
- 200-300 Mahakavyas composed in Sanskrit since independence. Total literary output is much more.
- I myself am in regular contact - in person and electronically - with a quite a few sanskrit scholars of the very high caliber - even more if you consider second degree contacts.



## Immortality by standardization
- Immortality due to early and respected standardization by the grammarians.
    
As suhAsa says [here](http://swarajyamag.com/columns/verses-which-produce-magic-when-re-read/): 

> "The Rāmāyaṇa is atleast 2500 years old. The hanumannāṭaka came more than 1500 years after it. And more than a millennium later came Rāma Śāstrī. And half a century later came Bacchu Subbarāyagupta. This literary chain may not seem unusual at first glance, yet it is an extraordinary thing to happen in a language. Languages come with lifetimes of less than a millennium.

> Old English is as intelligible to me as Hebrew. Reading Geoffrey Chaucer is like wading through quicksand. Time will ensure libraries move Shakespeare from the literature section to history section. 
> 
> But frozen in time by the spell of Pāṇini, only Classical Sanskrit will remain untouched. A few hundred years from now, a young boy (or girl), having taught himself Sanskrit, may decide to write a work to top Rāma Śāstrī. The poet to top Kālidasa may well be born a thousand years from now. My own descendants may spend a sunday afternoon, sipping soylent, and laughing at their ancestor’s metrical misadventures. How absurd it is to label such a language dead! Immortal is more like it."
