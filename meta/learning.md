> "The best way to learn Sanskrit is by immersing in its poetic literature after some basic grammar (for me, Karnataka State Board 8th std - 10th std first language Sanskrit grammar 1989-1992 was more than enough to easily understand Shriharsha's Naishadheeya)." - Dr R Shankar, Poet and avadhAnin

- Read 50 issues of https://sambhashanasandesha.in/ cover to cover. Take up SB correspondence course. Also read vAlmIki's rAmAyaNa cover to cover.

- A friend use lessons from chitrapur maTha to learn the basics, and then started reading shAstra-s, stotras and kAvya-s that interested him.
