**PREFACE.**

**देवशब्दाम्बुधिं ये हि गन्तुमिच्छन्ति बालकाः।  
तेषां भवत्वयं ग्रन्थः सदैव मार्गदर्शकः॥**

 In compiling the following lessons for, the Fourth and Third Classes of High English Schools, I have proceeded on the principle that students should know the main fundamental rules of the Sanskrit Grammar and need not trouble about the number of pages to be finished in the two academic years. I venture to hope that, if this principle of teaching Sanskrit be adhered to, students will learn the idiom of the language, and their minds will be fully prepared for the study of the Sanskrit Entrance Course in the next two years. Moreover, having once grasped the fundamental rules, all they then read will prove of real value in exercising their intelligence, and their curiosity may be awakened, during the plastic years of youth, for the study of the most ancient and sacred language of their motherland.

**ADVICE TO THE STUDENT.**

 The student should carefully read, along with this book, chapters on **सन्धि, शब्दरुप,** and **धातुरूप** from a Sanskrit Grammar and consult a Sanskrit-English Dictionary as often as necessity may arise. He should also use a



fresh note-book to take down what his teacher may dictate in the class-room. The grammatical rules at the beginning of each lesson may be omitted at the first reading. Lesson 43 must be learnt as soon as he is acquainted with the **देवानागरी** characters. He must learn to read and spell correctly and, when sufficiently advanced, he should note all grammatical rules that each word of a sentence may serve to illustrate.

**NOTICE.**

 1. Any correction or suggestion for improvement of the work will be most thankfully received.

 2. No copy of this book will be considered genuine unless it be issued by the author under his own seal and signature.
