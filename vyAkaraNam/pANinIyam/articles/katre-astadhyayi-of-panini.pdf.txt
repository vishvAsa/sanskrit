Typographical Conventions 
Accentuation 
Un-marked vowels represent anudatta vowels. The acute accent marks the udatta and the grave accent marks the svarita vowel. Capital letters indicate the IT markers. Vowels underlined by a single line indicate that they are used for pronunciation of morphemes of which they are not in- tegral parts, e.g., nuM stands for an infixed nasal /n/ only. An expres- sion in small capitals indicates that it is an artificial technical term. 
1Syllabics of the Nagari script omitted in the transliteration, e.g., k (for syllabic ka). 
Compounds 
Division of compound expressions into their component units is generally indicated by a hyphen, separating them when no samdhi operation is in- volved, but by the double hyphen otherwise. 
Cross references 
When three Arabic numerals are given, they stand respectively for adhy-ay-a, pad-a and su-tra numbers in that order, e.g., 3.1.1. When two alone are given they stand for the pad-a and su-tra numbers within the adhy-ay-a which is referred to in the immediately preceding three- figure reference. Similarly, the single number refers to the su-tra within the pad-a, and adhy-ay-a referred to in the previous two-figure reference. 
Markers 
The so-called 'IT-markers' are indicated by capital letters. The excep- tions are [ch], [ih], [th] and [dh] which (though forming part of the IT-class when they occur at the head of affixes) have not been indicated by capital letters since they are not subject to 1.3.9 (being replaced not by as in all other instances but by special morphemes by 7.1.2-7 and 7.3.50-51). Otherwise, by definition they are definitely IT-markers.

Preface 
Although there have been three renderings of Panini's Aṣṭādhyayī in modern European languages, they have been particularly addressed to those whose primary interest is in Sanskrit language and literature. The first of these was in German, published during 1839-40 under the title Panini's acht Bücher grammatischer Regeln in two volumes by Otto Böhtlingk, consisting of sütra-s and scholia, German comments on the sutra-s and various indexes. A new edition in 1887 entitled Panini's Grammatik with a German translation and various indexes became the standard reference work on Panini, and was reissued in 1964. Two English translations appeared in 1882, Panini's Eight Books of Gram- matical Sutra-s by W. Goonatileke and The Asṭadhyayī of Panini, edited and translated into English by Srisa Chandra Vasu in 1891. Louis Renou's La grammaire de Panini traduite du sanskrit avec des extraits des commentaires indigènes in French appeared in three fascicles during 1948-54 from Paris, and a revised edition in two volumes, with the Sanskrit text of the sutras, appeared in 1966. In all these translations, the sutra-text is given in Devanagarī characters. Renou used Roman transliteration for the illustrative examples in his French commentary, The need for an edition which gives the text of the sutras as well as il- lustrative material in transliteration appears necessary in the interest of those who are not primarily interested in Sanskrit language and litera- ture, but mainly concerned with it in relation to their work in linguistics. 
It was the discovery of Sanskrit grammar in the last quarter of the 18th century and the pronouncement of Sir William Jones, at the in- auguration of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, positing a relationship be- tween Sanskrit and the classical languages of Europe, that led in the early 19th century to the development of Comparative Philology and its ultimate transformation into modern Linguistics. The influence of Panini and the Indian schools of grammarians can be gained from the number of scholars who have expressed their appreciation as well as criticism of this tradition, a selection of whose contributions have been presented by J.F. Staal in A Reader on the Sanskrit Grammarians (MIT Press, 1972). Recently a great number of studies on this subject. have appeared both in India and abroad in the shape of monographs, 
research papers and doctoral dissertations. A very comprehensive survey of research on Panini has been published by George Cardona (Mouton: 1976). In view of the importance which Panini's work has for the development of modern Comparative Philology and Linguistics a new edition using Roman Transliteration both for the sutra-s and the ex- amples used in illustrating them is not out of place. Indeed it has the further advantage that the roman typography with its several faces and upper and lower case letters representing individual phonemes obviates the cumbrous use of Devanagari writing which is syllabic. Moreover, the metalinguistic features of Panini's rule-formation can be clearly per- ceived visually by metalinguistic use of roman, italic, small capitals and capitals and even indicate the use of vowels which Panini sometimes uses for ease of enunciation in presenting morphemes where those vowels are not integral parts of the morphemes themselves. 
While no attempt has been made in this presentation at giving a critical edition of the accompanying Dhatupatha and Ganapatha, care has been taken to compare the items as included in several editions and contributory studies. A comparative study of Dhatupatha-s as well as Ganapatha-s formed themes for doctoral dissertations presented to the Poona University, the first having been published by that University in 1957. The text of Ast. itself has come down with very few alterations since Patanjali's time, and while Kasika presents a slightly inflated text, Siddhanta-kaumudi in general preserves the text as given in Mahābhāṣya. The oral transmission of the text from time immemorial has preserved much of the original Vedic and post-Vedic literature, par- ticularly the sutra-literature. Patanjali indicates in his work that during his time people learned the Vedic texts without prior study of grammar (MBh. I 5, 8-10) and considered the study of grammar as not purposeful, which probably led to the gradual loss of much of Mahabhāṣya itself which was later subsumed by the efforts of savants like Bhartṛhari. We have on the other hand such significant remarks in the Kasikā [a kumara-m yasah panine-h 'Panini's fame has reached the young'] which are supported by the observations of the Chinese pilgrim I Tsing (691-92) such as: "Children begin to learn the Su-tra when they are eight years old, and can repeat it in eight months' time" (Staal, p. 12), while "Boys of fifteen begin to study this commentary (i.e., Vrt-ti-sutra or Kasikā) and understand it after five years" (ibid., p. 14) and with reference to MBh (referred to as Curni of Patanjali) "Advanced scholars learn this in three years" (ibid., p. 15). Probably the lost tradition which Patanjali mentions was revived after Bhartṛhari's restoration of the MBh. 
xvi 
The advantages of presenting the Sanskrit text in roman translitera- tion are obvious. Instead of the syllabic orthography we have the single phoneme character of the individual roman alphabet (except for the aspirate consonants kh, ch, th, th and ph) and the process of deriving the surface forms from underlying deep structures appears more elegant. Secondly for those not interested in pursuing special studies in Sanskrit literature, it has the advantage of a universal script which is commonly used in all modern linguistic studies. 
Many of the metalinguistic features of Ast. have found their place in modern linguistics, such as the concept of 0, the markers with specific functions, etc. The influence of Panini can also be seen in the founding. of several systems of grammar following Ast. in India, and similar sys- tems developed for Pali, fully influenced by Panini's model, such as Kaccayana-vy-a-kar-ana and those of Moggallana and Aggavamsa. For other Middle Indo-Aryan languages there are similar treatises composed in Sanskrit. The chief feature of these works is the tacit assumption that Sanskrit is the basis from which the Prakrit languages have sprung, and taking Maharastrī as the most favored Prakrit, since it was the medium of poetic compositions, a set of correspondences has been set up to explain the phonology and morphology of these MIA dialects. Indeed, long before comparative philology developed during the 19th century, the concept of a family of languages, derived from a common parent, ap- parently formed the bedrock on which these grammars were based, though no reconstructions appear to have been attempted. Indeed the tradition of Ast. was so strong that even grammars of some of the Dravidian languages were composed on its pattern, such as Tolkappiam for Tamil, Lilätilakam for Malayalam, Andhra-sabda-cintamani for Telugu and Karnataka-bhāṣā-bhūṣaṇa and Sabda-mani-darpana for Kannada. The latest work in this tradition is the Kerala-Paniniyam of Rajarajavarman (1863-1918) in the recent past. 
This work was undertaken while I was Director of Deccan College Postgraduate and Research Institute in Poona as part of Paninian Studies, included in its Building Centenary Series. However, the actual work was carried out during my stay in Austin at the University of Texas where I had been invited first as a Visiting Professor in 1966 in the Department of Linguistics and then in 1970 at the recently created Department of Oriental Languages and Literatures. My thanks are due to Professors W.P. Lehmann and Edgar C. Polomé for inviting me to Austin, and for their constant encouragement. The present work has 
xvii 
been made possible by a grant-in-aid by the American Council of Learned Societies for the year 1978-79 (ACLS NEH GIA '79) while I was serving as a Distinguished Visiting Lecturer in the Department of Lin- guistics at California State University, Fullerton. My thanks are also due to Professor V.I. Subramoniam, Vice-Chancellor of Tamil University, Tanjore, and the guiding spirit of the Dravidian Linguistic Association in Trivandrum, for inviting me to visit India under their joint auspices during 1982 to enable me to revise this work and make it ready for pub- lication. I must also express my thanks to Professors M.B. Emeneau and George Cardona for sponsoring my work to ACLS for a grant. In con- clusion, I also express my grateful thanks to Douglas L. Fix and the staff of the Linguistics Research Center for formatting the complicated text so carefully and to the University of Texas Press for including this work in its Linguistic Series.

Introduction 
The Astadhyay of Pánini is the earliest extant descriptive grammar of Sanskrit as currently spoken during his time (c. 6th cent. B.C.) and oc- casionally referred to by him as [Bhaṣa], in the north-west region of In- dia (now Pakistan). His extraordinary perception of linguistic facts covered, however, a wider region, since he not only refers to the earlier stage of the language as occurring in Vedic literature, but also spreads. over the northern and eastern parts of India whose regional variants he also notices in his majestic sweep. However, it is certainly not the first grammar composed about Sanskrit. Panini mentions ten predecessors [Apisali, Kasyapa, Gargya, Galava, Cakravarmana, Bharadvaja, Sakaṭayana, Šakalya, Senaka and Sphotayana], none of whose works have survived to our days. Of these earlier grammarians two are specifi- cally referred to in Patanjali's Mahabhāṣya. Apisali is mentioned by Katyayana in his varttika 2 on 4.1.14 [purva-sutra-nir-deso-va-apisala- m adh-T-te 'studies the grammar of Apisali'] while Patanjali refers to grammars promulgated by Panini, Apisali and Kasakṛtsna [panini-nā pr-o-k-ta-m panin-iya-m, apisalá-m kasakṛtsná-m MBh. I 12,5-6] and cites a verse line [nama ca dha-tu-ja-m ah-a nir-uk-t-e vy-a-kar-an-e sakata-sya ca toka-m MBh. II 138,14-16] in which Sakaṭāyana is men- tioned as holding the view that all nominal stems are derived from verbal stems. It is thus probable that during the times of both Katyayana and Patañjali their grammars were still available for study and were not overwhelmed by Panini's own work. A few traces of their work are to be found in commentarial literature on the systems of Sanskrit grammar.

The title of Panini's grammar as Aṣṭadhyayī occurs initially in the Mahabhaṣya (e.g., on 6.3.109). It is derived from the underlying string ast-au adhy-ay-aḥ sam-a-hr-t-ah/asṭa-nam adhy-ay-a-n-am sam-a-har- a-h = aṣṭan+adhy-ay-a+NiP (2.1.52; 4.1.21) =asta+adhy-ay-0+1 (8.2.7; 6.4.148) and denotes a collection of eight chapters'. By Panini's rule 5.1.58 (sam-khya-y-ah 'sam-jña-sam-gha-3sutra-*adhy-ay-ane-su) the expression ásta-ka-m (= ast-au adhy-ay-ah pari-ma-na-m a-sya = astan+kaN ástal-ka-m) also denotes, among other things, a work con- sisting of eight chapters. Panini evidently refers here to already existing. 
= 
works of that nature, but commentators have cited ásta-ka-m panin-fya-m as an illustration of this rule, and consequently it is also known alternatively by this title. It is possible that Panini might have Apisali's grammar in view when formulating this rule, since according to later tradition Apisali is said to have composed his grammar also in eight chapters.

If 
The name Panini itself is a patronymic derived from Panin-a (6.4.165; 4.1.95: panina-sya apatya-m = panina+iN pánino+i) in- dicating a son of Panin-a. However, Kasika has both paniny-upa-jña-m (2.4.21)/panin-o-pa-jña-m (6.2.114) a-kal-ak-am vy-a-kar-ana-m. both names apply to Panini, then Panin-a as applied to him indicates a yuvan (4.1.163-4) descendant of Pan-in. This makes him a grandson of Pan-in, but he has sometimes been called Pani-put-ra also. Among other synonyms we have Dakṣi-put-rá and Salaturiya which latter name presupposes that Salatura was his ancestral abode (4.3.94). 
stems 
The text of the Astadhyayī is preceded by a repertory or catalogue of phonemes divided into 14 strings or sutra-s, commonly designated Praty-a-har-a-sut-ra- (PS), Śiva-süt-ra (SS) or Mähesvara-sut-ra (MS) and followed by two lexicons enumerating the verbal (Dha-tu-path-a) and groups of nominal stems which undergo particular grammatical operations (Gana-path-a). While the text of Ast. has remained almost unchanged since Patanjali's time, the same cannot be said of the Dhatupatha or Ganapatha. 
In view of the su-tra style of the work, which, within a little less than 4000 algebraic statements, gives a complete description of the language, the work became the central piece of exegetical works, and in the history of linguistic texts, it occupies the premier position in that nearly a thousand treatises have been produced during the two millennia since it was composed by Panini. The earliest are the vartt-ika-s, chiefly of Katyayana (c. 4th c. B.C.) who supplements the rules of Panini, often criticizing them. His vartt-ika-s have been further commented upon, along with the su-tra-s by Patanjali in his Mahabhāṣya 'Great Commentary' with great finesse. These three sages, forming a formid- able triumvirate, represent the high mark of Paninian tradition. Unfor- tunately neither of these two works covers the whole text of Ast. Almost a thousand years later we have the full text commented upon. in the Kasi-ka of Vamana and Jayaditya (c. 7th cent. A.D.) with ample illustra- tions under each rule and a full citation of the gana-s under particular rules dealing with them. Käsika itself became the focal point of two 
XX 
other early commentaries by Jinendrabiddhi (Nyasa or Kasika-vi-var- ana-pañj-ik-a) and Haradatta (Padamañjar-1). Since the Ast. was meant to be transmitted verbally, the su-tra style imposed severe restrictions on the structure of the work, where even the saving of a mora was con- sidered meritorious. In order to preserve the mathematic structure of aphoristic rules topical arrangement had to be sacrificed to effect economy, resulting in a very recondite work, necessitating a lot of ex- egesis and running from section to section to generate the surface forms from the strings of underlying deep structure. So in course of time a rearrangement was effected by such works as Pra-kri-ya-kau-mud-T and Siddh-anta-Kau-mud-I which later became extremely popular at the ex- pense of Käsika as a standard text in both traditional and university schools. 
The eight chapters of Ast. are subdivided into quarter chapters (pada-s) each of which contains a certain number of su-tra-s. The first sutra of the first quarter of the first chapter begins with the definition of the technical term výd-dhi [vfd-dhi-r aT-aiC] wherein the technical term precedes the definition against the general pattern seen in the following sutra [aT-eN guna-h] and Patanjali explains this as Panini's wish for auspiciousness that he uses this word first. According to tradition, in- dicated by Patanjali, such auspicious expressions should be used at the beginning, middle and end of a work so that those studying the text may be successful in their endeavors. Here Panini uses this auspicious word at the beginning of his text. This is just another proof that the reper- tory of phonemes in. SS is not an integral part of Panini's text, but is based on it, since all the sigla he uses for explaining the grammatical operations are based on it. Patanjali's Mahabhasya begins with atha sabda-anu-sas-ana-m which he tries to explain himself. According to Kaiyața this expression is Patanjali's own which he comments on. Most original sutra works generally begin with the word atha followed by a word which describes the text which ensues. The word therefore cannot 
have been the title of Panini's own work. 
Panini's description of Sanskrit as it was spoken during his time is based on three fundamental units: (1) nominal stems (prati-pad-ika-), (2) verbal stems (dha-tu-) and (3) affixes (praty-ay-a-) introduced after the first two to generate additional stems as well as finished words [pada-s], with a set of rules to generate the surface forms from their deep struc- tures, and a set of rules on government to generate sentences as units of communication. The Dhatu-path-a catalogues all available verbal stems 
xxi 
divided into ten specific classes, while the Gana-path-a records groups of nominal stems which undergo specific grammatical operations given in the rules. There is, thus, no lexicon of nominal stems, since their num- ber is without any limit and depends upon actual usage. Since the ob- ject of grammar, according to the statements of Katyayana and Patanjali, is specified as explaining the usage current among the speakers of the language and is not prescriptive, such a listing of nominal stems appears to be incapable of completion. Patanjali cites here the case of the divine Brhas-pati and Indra, who, through continuous recitation of individual lexemes, could not come to an end, even in a thousand divine years! To achieve, therefore, a possible manner in which one can at- tempt a description which can cover the whole range of the language, Panini has attempted to arrange his sūtra-s under two major headings: [ut-sarg-a-] a general rule which encompasses the largest number of lin- guistic items, and [apa-vad-a-] an exception which covers a smaller group not subject to the general rule. 
In order to effect economy of expressions in the su-tra style Panini has devised a special metalinguistic language. In the first place, on the basis of the Praty-a-har-a Su-tra-s a number of sigla have been used to denote the group of phonemes which are subject to a specific grammati- cal operation. The model provided by these introductory su-tra-s has been followed in the Ast. by having a number of markers with specific indications. These markers are either phonemes occurring at the end or beginning of a morpheme or accent markers [udatta, anudatta or svarital or a nasalized vowel (anu-nas-ika). Next in order come the technical terms which are two-fold: current words, but with technical definitions, as in the case of urd-dhi, guna, or artificial ones like TI, GHU, 
BHA. 
In the formulation of rules special use is made of three declensional groups of affixes: ablative for indicating the right context, locative for the left context and genitive for the substituendum. Special use of the locative is made to indicate (a) the subordinate word [upa-pada-] in a compound expression derived from a verbal stem and (b) also to indicate the meaning of an expression, particularly with reference to those of verbal stems. This is followed regularly in the meanings assigned to verbal stems in the Dhatu-patha which, as originally compiled, did not contain the meanings. 
Since the structure of Ast. is primarily intended to be a text which is to be transmitted orally, the maximum brevity has been aimed at in for- 
xxii1 
mulating the su-tra-s. No verbal finite forms are employed. The inter- pretation of the su-tra by a proper sentence demands the filling of ellip- sis in the su-tra. So a process of anu-vrt-ti is required to fill in these gaps and the rules are arranged in such a way that this becomes possible from preceding rules. A consequence of this is that topical arrangement has been sacrificed to ensure maximum economy. A collection of rules. which are governed by a single rule is indicated by the forming of these governing rules with a svarita accent. Their extent depends upon par- ticular contexts. For instance the governing rule in 3.1.1 covers the whole of chapters 3 to 5. Within such extended governing rules there could be other smaller governing rules. Individual expressions from one rule. which should be carried on the following rule or rules are also expected to be enunciated with this accent. This was proper as long as the texts were transmitted orally from teacher to pupil in an unbroken line of de- scent. But this seems to have been broken at some time, since by the time Kasikā came to be composed, this accentual system was no longer current. Hence the general maxim prati-jña-svar-it-aḥ panin-Ty-aḥ whereby the commentaries alone are our source of where this accent would have been in the original text. Patanjali has already indicated in his MBh. that when there is doubt about the interpretation of a su-tra, recourse has to be had to an explication: vy-a-khya-na-to vi-ses-a-prati-pat-ti-h, na hi sam-deh-at-a-laks-ana-m. This is par- ticularly necessary in distinguishing between the ablative and genitive singular forms ending in -as [NasI/Nas] when the context does not in- dicate which is intended. Thus to a large extent the interpretation of each su-tra depends largely on the great commentaries beginning with. MBh. 
Panini has the largest section dealing with all classes of affixes in the three chapters 3-5. They may be classified as follows: (1) Those which generate verbal stems from simplicia (3.1.5-30). (2) Those which generate verbal themes: class-markers (3.1.67ff.) and markers of the Fu- ture (Sigmatic and non-Sigmatic), Aorist, Perfect. With reference to the class markers, the verbal system is divided into two major groups: sarva-dhātu-ka- (Present System) where the theme is generated with these markers before the 1-substitutes, and ardha-dhatu-ka where the theme is generated without the class-markers. The 1-substitutes are in- troduced after verbal themes (3.4.78). (3) Declensional affixes which are introduced after nominal stems (4.1.2), masculine, feminine or neuter. (4) Feminine affixes generating feminine nominal stems from other 
xxiii 
nominal stems (4.1.3-81). (5) Primary nominal affixes [krt 3.1.93-3.4.117] and secondary nominal affixes [taddhita 4.1.76-5.4.160]. Since a nominal stem includes not only one which is not subject to derivation but also those ending in primary and secondary nominal stems as well as the class of compounds generated by a combination of the preceding, there is a section which deals with such composition (2.1.3-3.38). Governing rules. in the generation of sentences are contained in 1.4.23-55, while the use of the declensional affixes in this connection is covered in 2.3.1-71. 
Since a sentence is generated by the three sets of primary units enumerated by Panini as nominal stems, verbal stems and a system of affixes which interact at the deep structure level, the morpho-phonemic rules which bring out the surface forms are dealt with under the general governing rule (sam-hi-ta-y-am 6.1.72-157; 3.114-139) and consonantal samdhi is dealt with in chapter 8. These changes involve (1) the replace- ment of the first phoneme before another phoneme, (2) the replacement of both phonemes by either the first or the second one or of the second phoneme after the first. In some cases there is replacement by zero in the pada-final position. Several morphemic changes which occur in ei- ther nominal or verbal stems before affixes involve either a zero- replacement of a phoneme in the original stem or the addition of a phoneme. This addition may be at the stem-final or stem-initial position or may take place prior to the last syllable beginning with a vowel. Panini uses the markers T for initial augment, K of final augment and M for an augment which is inserted before the final syllable beginning with a vowel. For zero-replacement he has four technical terms: lopa as a general term and luK, Ślu and luP for such replacement of an affix. 
The metalinguistic use of accents has particular relevance to the in- dication of the voice of a verbal stem. In the Dhatupatha they are given with one of these accents to indicate the voice associated with each stem: the [anudatta] accent indicates the Atmanepada or middle voice, while the [svarita] accent indicates both voices, the Atmanepada being used when the result of the action is intended for the subject; similarly the marker N indicates Atmanepada while Ñ indicates both voices as in the case of the svarita accent. Panini's language is characterized by accents which are suprasegmental phonemes. In later days this seems to have been lost, even at the time of Patanjali. Later grammatical systems have little to say about accents. Panini's rule 6.1.158 definitely shows that each pada or finished word had its own accent which he tries to describe in chapter 6. In the illustrations given in this work due care has been 
xxiv 
taken to show the pada accent even when sentences are given as illustra- tions, and sentence accent is indicated only in the section which deals with sentences specifically in the Ast. 
The general rule for accentuation of affixes is stated under 3.1.3; however, in many polysyllabic affixes it may fall on the penultimate syl- lable, and this is indicated by the marker R (6.1.217); if it falls on the final syllable of the affix, marker C is employed (6.1.163). On the other hand, if the affix generates an accent on the syllable preceding it, marker L is used (6.1.193). Similarly, if the affix does not bear any accent, marker P is used (3.1.4). In the case of secondary nominal forms ending in an affix marked with N or N the accent falls on the initial syllable of the secondary nominal stem, while it falls on the final syllable if the affix contains marker K (6.1.197,165). 
Morpho-phonemic changes in the surface forms of stems generated by secondary affixes are indicated by use of markers N or N, to indicate that the initial syllable of the surface nominal form is replaced by a vrddhi vowel (7.2.117-8). By a general rule the guna replacement of stem-final vowels iK (= i, u, F, !) is ruled in for verbal stems before sarvadhatuka and ardhadhatuka affixes (7.3.84) or stems ending in the final increment puK or having a penultimate light vowel (7.3.86) with modifications mentioned in 1.1.5 and 1.2.1-26. So by such metalinguistic usage Panini generates the surface forms with a minimum use of state- 
ments. 
Panini's methodology may be illustrated by his generalization of the declensional and verbal inflexional affixes. By 4.1.2 he has the following archetypal affixes for the nominal declension: 
Nominative 
Vocative 
1 SU 
2 
3 
au 
Jas 
Accusative 
am 
auT 
Śas 
Instrumental 
Та

bhyas 
Ablative 
Nasl 
bhyam 
bhyas 
Genitive 
Locative 
Nas Ni 
OS 
ām 
OS 
sup 
These are introduced without any change after all nominal stems ending in consonants for masculine and feminine classes. When neuter stems are involved he has three rules indicating that nom.-acc. singular forms replace both sU and am by [0/am] while nom.-acc. dual affixes are replaced by (Si] and the plural affixes Jas and Śas are replaced by [si]. These three allomorphs then cover the whole range of neuter stems. Ex- 
XXV 
cept for normal samdhi rules there is no change in the basic nominal stem forms. Next in order come both masc., fem. and neut. stems end- ing in semi-vowels. In the case of masc. forms, the stem undergoes a guna replacement of its final vowel before the affix Jas and those with marker Ń (except[Ni]), while the instr. sing. [Ta] is replaced by [na]. In the case of neut. stems an infixed increment [n] is inserted in the stems. before affixes with initial vowels. Similarly in the case of neut. stems. ending in [a] the infixed element is inserted before strong affixes begin- ning with a vowel [si]. For all stems, masc., fem., and neut. the genitive plural [am] gets an initial increment [nuT] before which the preceding vowel is replaced by the long one. Thus there is an allomorph for the stem as well as the affix. 
These archetypical affixes are introduced without any change after nominal stems ending in consonants, whether masculine or feminine. In the case of neuter stems allomorphs of some affixes are introduced: [SI] for nom.-acc. dual and [Si] for nom.-acc. plural. The only changes are due to normal samdhi rules: kr-t- m./n. 'doer', mrd- f. 'earth': m. 
krt+0 krt+sU = krt +0 (6.1.68)= kr-t; mrd+8U mrd+0= mrd; kr-t+bhyas kr=d=bhyas (8.4.53); mrd+sUP mrt-sU (8.4.55); n. kr-t+au

= 
= 
kr-t+ST 
kr-t-1; kr-t+si, kr-n-t-+i (7.1.72) where both the nominal stem as well as the affix have alloforms. Elsewhere, in all cases, whether stems end in vowels or consonants, neuters follow the same pattern as the masculines. Thus kr-t-a, kr-t-e, mrd-a, mrd-e from instrumental onwards for masc., fem. as well as neut. stems. 
A more complicated situation occurs in the case of nominal stems ending in short [i, u] which form a special class designated by Panini with the technical term GHI (1.4.7). Changes occur both in the stem as well as the affix in specific cases: for the masc. and fem. stems, guna re- placement of final vowel takes place before nom. plural affix and those affixes with marker N (except Ni) [cf. 7.3.108; 7.3.111]: hari+Jas = haray-ah (6.1.78); hari+Ne = harete = haray-e (6.1.78), hare+Nas(1) = har-e+as har-e-s (6.1.110); dhenu+Jas dheno+as = dhenav-ah; dhenu+Ne/Nas (1) dheno+e/Nas (1) dhenav-e, dhen-o-8. Before [Ni] of the loc. sing. the stem-final is replaced by short [a] (7.3.119) and [Ni] is replaced by [auT 7.3.118]: hari+Ni har-a+au = har-au (6.1.88), dhenu+Ni dhen-a+au = dhen-au. In the case of 
hare+as

== 
stems ending in short sonant vowel [r], there is first a replacement of the stem-final by [anaN 7.1.94] before the nominative sing. affix [sU], and by guna before the loc. sing. affix [Ni] and before strong affixes (7.3.110):

kar-tr+sU kar-tan+sU kar-tan +0 (6.1.68)= kar-ta (8.2.7)= kar-tā, kar-tr+au(T) kar+tar+au(T) kar-tar-au (6.4.11), kar-tar-as, kar-tar-am, kar-tr+Ni kar-tar-i. In all these three types the following allomorphs of affixes are introduced: for [Ta] the allomorph [na] and for gen. plural [am] an initial increment [nuT = nam], before which the short vowel final is replaced by the corresponding long one (6.4.3). In the case of neuter nouns ending in vowels the substitute morpheme Sĩ generates an infixed increment in the stem and also before affixes beginning with a vowel (7.1.73): vari+Si = vari+nuM+i = vārī-n-i (6.4.8); vari+Ta vari+nā (7.3.120), vari+Ne/Nas(1)/Ni vari-n-e/as/i, vari+am vāri+n-ām = vārī+n-am. The nom.-acc. sing. affixes sU and am are both replaced by Ø (7.1.23): vari+sU/am vari+= vāri.

Next in order are feminine stems ending in long [1, u] for which Panini has the technical term [strī 1.4.3] in which class feminine stems ending in short [i, u] are also included when affixes with marker N are introduced after them (1.4.6). In the case of stems ending in long [a] the nominative and accusative dual affixes are replaced by [ST 7.1.18]: rama+au(T) = ramā+Śi = rama+ī = ram-e (6.1.87). Stem-final [a] is replaced by [e] before affixes [Ta, os 7.3.105]: rama+Ta rame+a = ram-ay-a; rama+os ram-e+os ram-ay-oh. This same phoneme also replaces stem-final [a] before the vocative singular 
vocative singular affix SU: rama+sU(voc.) = rame+0 (6.1.69) where replaces the voc. sing. affix. This operates also on stems ending in short vowels [a, i, and u]: hari+sU = hare+0; dhenu+sU dheno+0; deva+sU deva+0. Affixes marked with N as IT receive an initial increment [yaT] after such stems (7.3.113): mālā+Ne/Nas(1) = mālā+ya-e/mālā+ya-as mālā-yai (6.1.88)/ mālā-yās (6.1.101). The affix [Ni] is replaced by [am]: mala+ya-Ni = mālā+yā-am = mālā-yām.

In the case of stems ending in long [i, u], by 7.3.107 the vocative sing. affix operates a replacement of the long by the short vowel: nadi+sU = nadi+0 (6.1.68)= nadi; vadhu+8U vadhu +0= vadhu. Affixes with marker N acquire an initial increment [aT] after these stems: nadi+Ne nadi+aT-e nadi+ai (6.1.89-90)= nady-ai; nadi+Nas(1) = nadi+a-as = nady-as; nadi+Ni nadi+a+am (7.3.116). Since before these affixes. feminine stems ending in short [i, u] are also designated by the technical term [nadi], we have the alternative surface forms: dhenu+Ne dhenav- e/dhenv-ai; dhenu+Nas(I) dhen-o-s/dhenv-as; dhenu+Ni 
dhen-au/dhenu-ām; mat-au/maty-am.

Among the most complicated system, involving the maximum num- ber of allomorphic changes come nominal stems ending in short [a], despite the fact that this class constitutes the largest number of lexemes in the Sanskrit language, and most studies start with the declension of this class, even in the rearranged works like Prakriya-kaumudi and Siddhanta-kaumudi. Allormorphs of the stem as well as of the affixes are more in evidence here. These nominal stems comprise substantives and adjectives as one class and pronominal stems as another class. In the case of nominal stems we have, first, a replacement of stem-final vowel by [e] before plural affixes beginning with non-nasal consonants (7.3.103): deva+bhyas = deve-bhyas; deva+sUP = deve-su (8.3.79); second, a replacement by the long vowel [a] before affixes beginning with [yaÑ: y, bh 7.3.102]: deva+Ne deva+ya (7.1.13)= deva-ya; deva+bhyam =deva-bhyam; thirdly, replacement by [e] before affix [os]: deva+os deve+os devay-os. The allomorphs for affixes are: [ina] for [Ta], [at] for [Nasl], [sya] for [Nas] by 7.1.12: deva+Ta = devatina dev-e-na; deva+Nasl deva+at dev-a-t; deva+Nas 
= = stems ending in short vowels, [a] is also replaced by the long vowel be- fore the affix [-n-am]: deva+am deva+nuT-am (7.1.14) deva-nām. The allomorph for the instr. plur. affix [bhis] is [ais]: deva+bhis = deva+ais dev-ai-s.

deva-sya. Like other 
Pronominal stems ending in [a] differ to some extent from the above. The nominative plural affix [Jas] is replaced by [ST 7.1.17]: sarva+Jas = sarvati sarv-e; with the preceding class of nominal stems ending in short vowels, the final phoneme of [Sas], after the stem-final and affix in- itial are replaced by the long vowel corresponding to the first (6.1.102-3), is replaced by [n]: deva+Śas dev-a-(s-n) dev-a-n; similarly for the masculine stems in short vowels: har-T-n, sun-u-n, pit--n, sarv-a-n. [Ne] is replaced by [smai]: sarva+Ne sarva+smai; [Nasl] and [Ni] are replaced respectively by [smat, smin]: sarva+NasI = sarva-smat; sarva+Ni sarva+smin. [am] gets an initial increment [suT]: sarva +ām sarva+suT-am sarve-sam (7.3.103, 8.3.59). In like man- ner pronominal stems ending in long [a] differ from the corresponding nominal stems by having allomorphs for some of the declensional affixes: those marked with N as IT get an initial increment [syaT] while the stem-final is replaced by short [a]: sarva+Ne = sarvatsya-e = sarva- syai; sarva+Nas (1) sarva+sya-as sarva-syās; sarva-Ni sarva+sya+am; sarvātām sarva+s-am (7.3.103). In the case of the first and second personal pronouns there are the largest number of al-

lomorphs before the declensional affixes, some of which also undergo re- placement. [asm-ad-] has the following allomorphs: sing. [aha-] before nom. sing. (7.2.94), [mahya-] before dative sing., [mama] before genitive sing., [ma] before sing. affixes, [ava] before dual affixes, [vaya] before nom. plur. (7.3.92-97). The affixes replaced are: [Ne] and nom-acc. af- fixes by [am 7.1.28]. Before the acc. affixes stem-final vowel is replaced by the long one (7.2.87). The acc. plur. [Sas] is replaced by [n]: asm-ad+sas asm-aa+Sas (7.2.102)= asm-a+n (6.1.97)= asm-a-n. Da tive plur. [bhyas] is replaced by [abhyam 7.1.30] while the corresponding ablative plural is replaced by [at 7.1.31]: asm-ad+bhyas = asm-a- a+bhyam asm-a-bhyam (6.1.97), asm-ad+bhyas asm-a-a+at = asm- a+at asm-a-t (6.1.97). [Nasl] is replaced by [at] also: asm-ad+NasI = ma-ad+Nasl ma-aa+at m-a-t. The pronominal substitute genitive plur. [s-am] is replaced by [akam]: asm-ad+sam asm-aa+ākam = asm-a+ākam asm-akam.

While the archetypal affixes remain constant after stems ending in consonants, we have morpho-phonemic changes in the stems themselves in the case of some special types such as those ending in [-n] where be- fore strong affixes, the penultimate vowel is replaced by the correspond- ing long one (6.4.8): raj-an+sU raj-an+0 (6.1.668)= raj-a0 (8.2.7); raj-an-au, rāj-an-aḥ, raj-an-am. Before affixes beginning with a vowel, stems ending in [-an-] replace the penultimate vowel by 0 (6.4.134): rāj-an+Śas/Ta raj-ñ-as/-a, raj-an+bhyam/bhis raj-all-bhyam/ -bhis (8.2.7), giving three sets of allomorphs: raj-an-, raj-an, rāj-Øn-. Stems generated by affixes containing a marker indicated by the siglum uK (U, R, L) receive an infixed increment [nuM] before strong affixes [suT, Si 1.1.42-43]: mah+atU mah-at+sU/au/Jas/am = mah-ant+0 (6.1.68) mahan (8.2.23), mah-ant-au. mah-ant-ah/mah-ant-am (6.4.10); dhi+matUP = dhi-mat+sU/au/Jas = dhi-mant +0 = dhi-mang = dhi-man, dhi-mant-au, dhi-mant-ah, dhi-mant-am; gam+SatR gam+SaP+at- 
gacch-a-at- (7.3.77)= gacch-a-t (6.1.97)+sU gacch-ant+0 (6.1.68)= gacch-an (8.2.23) gacch-ant-au. 
In the case of stems generated by affixes [trC, trN], the penultimate vowel is replaced by the long one before strong affixes [Si, SUT 1.1.42-43, 6.4.11]: kr+trC/trN (7.1.94) kar-tan +0 = kar-ta0 = kar-ta; kar-tar+au/Jas, am (7.3.110)= kar-tär-au, kar-tar-as, kar-tär-am.. Stems ending in [in-] have the penultimate vowel replaced by the long one before nom. sing. affix [sU]: dand-in+sU dand-in-0 (6.1.68), dand-0 (8.2.7) contra dand-in-au, 
dand-in-a.

Stems ending in [-s] exhibit a similar change before strong affixes (6.4.10): pr-e-yas (UN)+sU/au/Jas/am =pr-e-ya-n-8+8U = pre-yans+0 (6.1.68)= pr-e-yang (8.2.23), pr-eyams-au, etc. sarp-is+Si sarpi-n-s-i sarpims-i (8.3.24,58; 6.4.8). A more complicated situation is to be seen in the case of perfect participles ending in the affix [KvasU (3.2.107)]: vid+KvasU = vid-vas- which has three allomorphs: vid-va-n-s (= vid-vams- 8.3.24) before strong affixes, vid-vas- before affixes beginning with consonants and vid-us- before initial vowel of affixes: vid-van, 
vid-vams-au, 
vid-us-ah, vid-us-a; vidvad-bhyam, 
vid-vāms-as; 
vid-vad-bhih (8.2.72). 
Separate rules indicate the allomorphs of some pronominal stems like [id-am-, ad-as, et-ad-, tad-, tyad-] etc., cf. 7.2.102ff. 
It is particularly with reference to the declensional affixes as set down by Panini as archetypal which minimizes the set of rules for deriving the allomorphs from them with the least effort. The table below shows the basic forms with their allomorphs:

Since Panini deals with both nominal and verbal stems and the af- fixes introduced after them to generate the surface forms a great deal of attention has been paid to the nature of these pre-affixal stems in order to minimize the statements necessary for morpho-phonemic changes. The pre-affixal stem is designated by the technical term [anga- 1.4.13]. A very large part of the Ast. is devoted to this section, the governing rule 6.4.1 carrying over to the end of the seventh chapter (7.4.97). Morpho-phonemic changes in the pre-affixal stem are all dealt with fully in this section. While the technical term [pada] denotes a finished word ending in either the [SUP] or [tiN] triplets (1.4.14) its role is extended to an [anga] before affixes beginning with Kya- [ KyaN, KyaC, Kyas] (1.4.15) or before an affix with marker S as IT (1.4.16) and also before affixes beginning with [Sas] (4.1.2) and ending with kaP (5.4.1.151). Changes occurring to a [pada] are covered by the governing rule 8.1.16 extending up to 8.3.54. Similarly changes occurring to the right of a [pada] are covered by governing rule 8.1.17 extending up to 8.1.68. A 
xxxiithird situation arises as an exception to the [pada] status defined by 1.4.17 when the affix introduced after it begins with a vowel or semi- vowel [y] and is covered by the technical term [BHA 1.4.18]. It also covers the affixes with initial [t] or [s] having the sense of affix [matUP 1.4.19]. Governing rule 6.4.129 extending up to the end of the chapter covers the changes occurring in this type of stem. By distinguishing the stem in this three-fold manner Panini minimizes the application of some of his replacement rules which would otherwise generate unacceptable forms. Thus from marut- 'wind' we have [pada-s] such as marut +Ta/ Ne/Nas(I)/Ni marut-a/-e/-as/-i where 8.2.39 is inapplicable because here the stem in not a [pada] but [BHA]. On the other hand such excep- tional forms which occur in the Veda like ayas-maya- (1.4.20) contra classical ayo-maya- (6.1.114) are exceptions to this classification. In the case of rk-vat-a derived from 
from the underlying deep structure rc+vatUP+Ta, by its status as a [pada] the palatal stop [c] is replaced by the velar stop [k 8.2.30], but by its status as a [BHA] it is not replaced by the corresponding voiced phoneme (by 8.2.39). The [pada] status of raj-an- before affixes beginning with a consonant other than [y-] makes 8.2.7 applicable to generate the surface form from raj-an+bhyam/bhis/ bhyas raj-ab-bhyam/bhis/bhyas. By the ordering of rules in such a manner that rules stated after 8.2.1 are considered not to have taken ef- fect if the situation generated by its application becomes subject to the operation of any rule in the earlier section of the Ast: thus in raj-al+bhyam/bhyas the rules [SUP-i ca 7.3.102] and [bahu-vac-an-e jhaly eT 7.3.103] cannot operate, as at the time of their operation 8.2.7 is considered invalid, and the condition that the stem should end in short [a] is not satisfied. 
Panini's treatment of the conjugation of verbal stems also indicates the insights which he combines with the need for brevity. He classifies the system into ten main categories of tenses and moods and has the technical term [1] to designate them. In order to indicate each of these ten he has the following t.tt.: LAT for Present Indicative, IIT for Perfect, IUT for non-sigmatic Future, IRT for sigmatic Future, IET for (Vedic) Subjunctive forming one group with marker [T] as IT, and IAN Imper- fect, IIN Optative, IUN Aorist and IRN the Conditional, forming a second group with marker [N] as IT. The verbal stems have three con- structions: active [kar-tar-i], passive [kar-man-i] and impersonal [bhav-e] but two voices: active [para-smai-pada] and middle [at-man-e-pada]. The passive and impersonal constructions are effected by introducing the

Atmanepada affixes after a special theme with the marker [yaK 3.1.67]. Verbal stems, in their active construction, can have either Parasmaipada or Atmanepada affixes introduced after them. Some take exclusively Parasmaipada while others take Atmanepada affixes. The group of stems which take the latter are marked with an anudatta or [N] as an IT in the Dhatupatha. A number of stems take optionally one of them, the first being used when the fruit of the action is intended for other than the subject, while the second is used when it is intended for the subject and they are indicated in the Dhp. by svarita accent or [N] as IT. Those which take the Parasmaipada are remaining stems in the active construc- tion: cf. 1.3.12,72,78. 
When an 1-member is introduced after a verbal stem one of two things may happen: if the construction is active, the verbal stem receives its class-marker before the 1-substitutes replace the 1-member; if the con- struction is either passive or impersonal, the corresponding marker [yaK] is introduced before the l-substitutes. In the active construction there are nine classes of verbal stems, each having its particular marker [vi-kar-ana-]: These are according to their classificatory number [SaP] for [bhu-] class, 01 [Sap-luK] for [ad-] class, 02 [Ślu] for [hu-] class, [SyaN] for [div-] class, [Snu] for [su-] class, (Sa] for [tud-] class, [SnaM] for [rudh-] class, [u] for [tan-] class and [Śna] for [krī-] class as given in the Dhp. The so-called tenth class is but a new generation of verbal stems, which also includes causatives generated from primary verbs, with marker [NIC] and take the marker [SaP] before l-substitutes. 3.1.5-30 introduce a class of affixes, including [NiC] which generate new verbal stems defined by the t.t. [dha-tu- 3.1.32], but these affixes are optional when the stems are followed by ardha-dhatuka affixes. This classifica- tion of sarva-dhatuka and ardha-dhatuka has its explanation in the fact that the first are introduced after the whole verbal stem + its class marker which, to distinguish it from the stem, may here be designated "theme", while the second group of affixes are introduced after the primitive stem which may be considered as [ardha-dhatu-]. Thus sarvadhātuka affixes are introduced after verbal themes while the other 
class is introduced after the basic verbal stems. The word theme will also designate the final [anga] which appears before the particular 1- substitute of an l-member. 
There are three persons and three numbers. Thus each of the voices contains nine affixes. Their archetypal forms as given by Pánini are:

By 1.1.71 two sigla are generated: tiN for the whole group of 1- substitutes, and taN for the Atmanepada substitutes. The siglum tiN also represents a [pada] ending in these affixes, just as [suP] represents not only the twenty-one declensional affixes but also a [pada] ending in 
them. 
One may also note that while the Parasmaipada affixes belong primarily to the Present system, the Atmane-pada affixes indicate a secondary system. Panini's classifying the 1-members in two groups respectively marked by [T] and [N] shares many common features requir- ing minimum rules of replacement, as we shall see. The Parasmaipada affixes in their canonical forms hold good without any change (except for the replacement of initial [jh] by [ant] for the Present Indicative), the two Futures (except for the third person in the case of IUT or non- sigmatic Future), and the Conditional. For IUT there is a replacement of the third person affixes by [Da, rau, ras 2.4.87]. For the Perfect all the nine affixes are replaced by the following scheme: (3.4.82).

For the Imperative the following substitutions are indicated: 3.4.85: it shares the same affixes as LAN or Imperfect, viz. [tas, thas, tha, miP] are respectively replaced by [tam, tam, ta, am 3.4.101]. In addition the fol- lowing substitute rules yield the new allomorphs: (1) affix final [i] replaced by [u]: [tu] sing, [antu] plur; (2) [siP] replaced by [hi] which is not marked by P as IT (3.4.87) and [miP] is replaced by [ni 3.4.83]. By 3.4.99 affix final [s] is replaced by 0. Thus there is an interlinking in this of both the groups of l-members with marker [T, N], yielding the following scheme:

In addition the affixes of the first person get an initial increment [aT] which is marked with P as IT (6.4.92) for both sets of affixes. 
For the Atmanepada affixes the following set of rules indicates the substitute allomorphs: by 3.4.79 1-substitutes of l-members with marker [T] are generated by replacing the last syllable beginning with a vowel (TI) by [e]: thus [ta] becomes [te], [a(n)ta] becomes [ante] and so on; [thas] is replaced by [se 3.4.80], and we get the following scheme:

By 7.1.4-5 the element [jb] of the 3rd pers. plur. is replaced by [at] when introduced after reduplicated themes or themes which do not end in short [a]. 
For the Imperative [IOT] the following additional rules apply: 3.4.91 provides for replacement of affix final of [se, dhve] respectively by [va, am] yielding [sva, dhvam]; 3.4.93 provides the replacement of the first person affix-final [e] by [ai]. Elsewhere [e] is replaced by [am] by 3.4.90.

Vedic Subjunctive [IET] like the Imperative [1OT] shares the features of both the [T] and [N] groups of l-members, cf. 3.4.94 whereby the af- fixes receive an initial increment [aT] or [aT]: e.g., [pat-a+a-ti = pat-a-ti]. The long [a] of affixes is replaced by [ai]: [mantr-ay-aite]; this is an optional rule, and similarly [i] of affixes is optionally replaced by 0 (3.4.97). 
The archetypal affixes for [taN] given by Panini constitute the basic secondary affixes, introduced without any change as substitutes for [IAN, IUN, IRN], respectively the Imperfect, Aorist and Conditional. With ref- erence to Optative [IN] and its sub-variety Precative or Benedictive which functions as ardha-dhatu-ka (3.4.116) we have the following al- lomorphs: first, there is an initial increment [yasuT] for Parasmaipada affixes and [siyuT] for Atmanepada affixes (3.4.102-3), and an additional 
xxxvi 
increment [suT] preceding phonemes [t, th] of affixes, which, in the case of sarva-dhātu-ka Optative are replaced by (7.2.79). The 3rd pers. plur. [jha] is replaced by [ran], and the 1st pers. sing. [i] is replaced by [a]. The scheme of affixes for Optative Atmanepada is, therefore:

Panini distinguishes between a verbal stem and a verbal theme. By including the affixes beginning with [saN: 3.1.5] and ending with [NIN 3.1.30] as those building up derived verbal stems (3.1.32) he provides for generating themes from them by introducing the general active class marker SaP (3.1.68) before sarva-dhātu-ka affixes. There are other markers which generate themes before l-substitutes. The marker [sya] characterizes the verbal theme before l-substitutes of the sigmatic Future [IRT] and the Conditional [IRN] (3.1.33). Likewise before l-substitutes of [IET] Subjunctive there is an optional marker [siP] (3.1.34). Before [IT] substitutes, a derived verbal stem has the marker [am], and similarly the verbal stem [kas-] (3.1.35) and those which begin with a vowel other than [a], which is heavy (3.1.36), and a few others (3.1.37-39). Before [IUN] substitutes the theme is generated by several markers: [Cli] replaced by [sic 3.1.44], [Ksa 3.1.45], [CaN 3.1.48], [aN 3.1.52], [CIN 3.1.60ff.], [ 2.4.77] yielding a number of themes giving seven types: (1) 
xxxvii 
Root Aorist (Ø replacement of si C), (2) a-Aorist (aN), (3) reduplicated Aorist (CaN), and 4 sub-types of sigmatic Aorists: (4) s-Aorist [si C], (5) sa-Aorist [Ksa], (6) i-s-Aorist (= iT+SiC) and (7) s-i-s-Aorist [saK 7.2.73+it+siC]. Themes are generated before [IT] substitutes by a process of reduplication for which simple rules are given in 6.1.1-3,8, and 7.4.59-62,66. Reduplication rules pertaining to the formation of inten- sive stems are contained in 7.4.82ff.

= 
One of the original concepts in the Ast. is that of the zero affix. The zero replacement of any item is generally indicated by the technical term [lop-a- 1.1.60] and of affixes by the special terms [luK, Ślu, luP 1.1.61]. The need for this distinction is with reference to the general rule 1.1.63 which stipulates that when an affix is replaced by 0, its presence is still felt in effecting the morpho-phonemic change due to it. Thus agni-m ci-tavan agni+ci+KviP (3.2.91) agni-ci-t- (6.1.71)+sU agni-ci-t-0 (6.1.68) agni-ci-t 'who had lit the sacrificial fire' is considered a [pada] despite the non-appearance of the SUP triplet. On the other hand a re- placement of an affix by employing one of the three t.tt. containing [lu-] is an exception to this rule: vid+(SaP→ luK 2.4.72)+tas = vit-0+tas; since this affix is deemed to be marked by [N] as IT (1.2.4), there is no guna replacement of the theme-final vowel, and does not bar the operation of 1.1.5. 
Each of these three zero affixes 01, 02 and 3 (respectively denoting [luK], [Ślu], and [luP]) has its own special field. Ślu alone is restricted as substitute for SaP (2.4.75). 03 [luP] preserves the number and gender of the stem after which it is introduced (1.2.51). 
The general rule which bars replacement by guna vowels (1.1.5) has two markers [K, NJ and by later interpretation also [*G]. Why was it necessary to have more than one marker? The Ast. has K-IT as well as NIT l-substitutes: among such K-IT affixes are l-substitutes of [IT]which are not marked as P-IT when introduced after verbal stems which do not terminate in a conjunct nexus (1.2.6) and other affixes indicated in 1.2.7-17, with exceptions shown in 1.2.18ff. On the other hand all sarva-dhātu-ka affixes which are not marked by P as IT are regarded as N-IT (1.2.4) as well as l-substitutes not marked by [N] or [N] as IT (1.2.1) and initial increment [IT] introduced after the verbal stem [vij- 1.2.2], but optionally after [urnu-] 1.2.3; similarly the initial increment [yasuT] of Parasmaipada 1-substitutes of [IN], but which is K-IT when intro- duced as 1-substitutes of Precative. Since both markers prevent the 
xxxviii 
operation of (7.3.84,86) by the meta-rule 1.1.5, the reason for differentia- tion is with reference to vocalization (sam-pra-sar-ana) of semi-vowels: 6.1.15 applies this vocalization to the verbal stems [vac-, svap-] and the group beginning with [yaj] before K-IT affixes, while the following rule. 16 applies to stems beginning with [grah-] before both K-IT and N-IT af- fixes. This provides the justification for the use of both markers in 1.1.5. By interpretation later critics of Ast. have included *G also as such a marker since the nexus [G-K-N] results by samdhi into [*K-K-N = K-N] and this justifies the surface form stha-snu- (3.2.139) where the af- fix is given as [Ksnu]. If it is K-IT then 6.4.66 would operate to yield an unacceptable form sthi-snu-. 
The necessity of the Dhatu-patha will be seen time and again when Panini refers to verbal stems marked specifically with an accent or a phoneme as an IT. When he defines Atmanepada stems as designated with an anudatta marker or by [N], it is the Dhp. which supplies such a list. References such as [anudatta-upadesa- 6.4.37] refer one to the Dhp.

Verbal stems marked by [NI] as IT, for instance, generate participles ending in [Ktá] to denote the present (3.2.180). Verbal stems with [DU] as marker generate a nominal stem with affix [Ktrí] 3.3.88 and those with [TU] generate nominal stems with [athúC] 3.3.89. Similarly a stem characterized by [a] as IT does not operate the initial augment [IT] of an ardhadhātuka affix (7.2.16): NI-mid-A+Ktá = mid+tá min-ná- (8.2.42). Stems with marker [O] are also subject to the operation of 8.2.48: O-vij-I+Ktá vij+tá = vij+ná vig-ná (8.2.30). Stems with marker [I] as IT do not also operate the initial augment [iT] on affixes denoted by t.t. [nistha: Ktá, KtávatU 1.1.26]: cf. vig-na-. Stems with [I] as marker insert an infixed increment after the last vowel of the stem (7.1.58). Stems with marker [U] optionally operate the initial increment [IT] on affix Ktva (7.2.56). Those marked with long [U] as IT optionally operate the initial increment [iT] before ardha-dhatuka affixes (7.2.44). The operation of 7.4.1 is barred from stems with marker [R] (7.4.2). Stems with marker [L] have the Aorist marker [aN] before Parasmaipada 1-substitutes (3.1.55). The operation of 7.2.1 is not applicable to stems with marker [E] as IT (7.2.5). Stems ending in [S] as IT generate feminine nominal stems with affix [áN] (3.3.104): jrS+áN+TaP (4.1.4)= jar-á (7.4.16). Lastly those with [IR] as marker optionally have the Aorist marker [aN] for the [Cli] substitute [sic] (3.1.57). All these rules are indications that for understanding the operation of these rules the Dhp. lexicon is a prime necessity.

= 
One of the most complicated topics involved is that of the governing rule 7.2.35 which indicates that before an ardha-dhatuka affix with an initial consonant other than semi-vowel [y vaL] an initial increment is added defined by [iT]. This operation is not only governed by the con- ditions stated in this rule, but is subject also to the nature of the verbal stem after which such affixes are introduced. Beginning with 7.2.8, ex- ceptions to this rule are stated. Rule 10 indicates that stems marked with anudatta accent when first introduced (i.e., in the Dhp.) and are monosyllabic, do not bring about this increment. Here again an appeal has to be made to the Dhp. lexicon. The section dealing with details of this augment ends with 7.2.75, and goes forward to extend the scope of this augment for some sarva-dhatu-ka affixes also (76-78). In a number of cases, while specifying the larger inclusive classes such as [bhu-] the word [adi-] is used to denote them; similarly for shorter groups we have a similar use, as in [pū-ādīn-n-am 7.3.80], or the word [pra-bhr-ti-] as in the case of (adi-pra-bhr-ti-bhyah SaPaḥ 2.4.72) or the plural of the first stem to denote the group concerned (with or without a number): [kir-as-ca pañca-bhyah 7.2.75] or [dyud-bhyo IUN-i 1.3.91]. The need for referring to the Dhp. arises in all such cases. 
In a similar manner the Ganapatha is an essential accompaniment to the Ast. The section dealing with taddhita formation (4.1.76 to the end of chapter 5) shows all such instances where one has to go to the Ganapatha for the full operation of the rules stated in this section. 
One special feature of affixes remains to be stated. While primary [krt] and secondary [taddhita] affixes generate primary and secondary nominal stems, there is one area of a [prati-pad-ika-] which deals specifi- cally with the generation of compounds. But in the generation of a number of them, we have a section of the taddhita affixes which are primarily concerned, not with the individual nominal stems which go into composition, but with the compound as a whole, after which these affixes are introduced. They go under the governing rule of [sam-asa-ant-aḥ 5.4.68 to the end of the chapter]. Of the many such af- fixes we may note three here; DáC 5.4.73; áC 5.4.75ff.; TÁC 5.4.01ff.]; while these three in fact represent an accented [á] as the affix, the markers used to distinguish them have a special significance. [DaC], by 6.4.143 replaces the syllable beginning with the final vowel of the nominal stem by 0: dv-au va tray-o vā dvi+tri+DáC (5.4.73)= dvi-tr+0á+Jas dvi-tr-á-h 'consisting of two or three'. Affix [TaC] generates a feminine stem with affix [NIP 4.1.15]. The marker [T] 
xl 
= 
specifically generates this type of feminine stems. 
Panini's system of markers is so complicated that many times interpretation is necessary. As an example we may cite: pac+LAT = pac+SaP+SanaC (3.2.124)+TaP (4.1.4)= pac-a+m-an-a; since the affix is a replacement for [AT] by 1.1.56, it has the same function as [LAT] and by 4.1.15 fem. affix [NP] is required; but interpretation comes in here to explain that since [AT] has two markers, the function of [T] is to separate [LAT] along with other 1- members with that marker from those which are marked by [N]. Again this marker [N] as applied to l-members does not come under the opera- tion of the metalinguistic rule 1.1.5. Its function is to separate the two sets of l-members which come under two different sets of l-substitutes, primary and secondary. Another illustration of such multiple markers is the affix [CphaN] where [N] does not operate under 6.1.197 for accent but only for 7.2.117 for replacement of the vowel of the initial syllable by vrddhi, while [C] operates under 6.4.163. 
One of the unique features of Ast. is the role of accent. Later gram- matical systems are not at all concerned with this topic. A remodeling of Ast. in Candra-vy-a-kar-ana omits the section on accent. It is possible. that the phonemic role of accent which is so vital to Panini's description of his native speech did not play a role during the period of Katyāyana and Patanjali. While Patanjali does discuss the role of accent in so far. as sacrificers are involved, its role in common speech has not generated any special comments. In fact Patanjali himself interprets the rule 1.1.70 by analyzing the rule [ta-para-s tat-kala-sya 1.1.70] as [ta-ḥ par-o ya-smat so'yam ta-para-h; tat-api para-h ta-para-h]. The first is a bahuvrihi compound and is accented on the first member, while the second is a tatpurusa and accented on the final syllable of the compound expression. Such an analysis can only be possible if accent was not phonemic in the common speech. The liturgical language alone seems to have kept the role of accent at all times in carrying out the functions as- signed to particular ceremonies. Patanjali refers to the sages who used to say [yar-va nas tar va-nas] in their normal speech but spoke correctly as (yad va nas tad va nah] while performing Vedic rituals. 
According to Panini each [pada] or finished word has all its syllables as anudatta except for one which bears either the udatta or svarita ac- cent. By a general rule 3.1.3 an affix normally bears the accent on its initial syllable. Any departure from this governing rule is indicated by special rules. For instance all affixes with marker [P] as well as the declensional affixes denoted by the siglum SUP are anudatta (3.1.4). 
xli 
That accent is phonemic can be seen from a few examples. While inter- preting the rule [tulya-as-ya-pra-yat-na-m sa-varna-m 1.1.9] Patanjali explains the word [as-yà-] as derived from the stem [asU IV 100] with af- fix [NyàT] which by 6.1.185 bears the svarita accent on the affix, but in the context of the sutra, he derives it further as [as-y-è bhav-a-m = as-ya+yaT 5.1.6] which by 6.1.213 bears the udatta accent on the first syllable, and refers to a point of articulation within the buccal region. A difference in the accent accounts for the difference of meaning. Similarly 5.2.49 provides for the formation of ordinals prior to 'eleventh' by ruling in an initial increment [maT] to the affix [DáT 5.2.48], and we have. forms like pañca-m-á-, sapta-má-, asta-m-á- from the numerals pañcan-, saptan-, astan- respectively, the marker [D] effecting replacement of the syllable beginning with the final vowel (6.4.143). By 5.3.49 affix [aN] is introduced after these ordinals to denote a fraction: the resulting forms are homophonous, but the accent moves to the initial syllable (6.1.197). Thus accent is phonemic and must have been perceptible during Panini's time since he is so careful in recording facts. 
Since the [pada] is the unit which bears an accent on one of its syl- lables, the question arises as to what happens to the constituent parts of a [pada] each of which may have its own individual accent. In fact the Dhatupatha gives the list of verbal stems indicating their accents which indicates that verbal stems may have their own individual accents. Ex- cept in a few cases the Ganapatha does not mark the accents of nominal stems. Their accent is to be deduced from the underlying deep structure which generates the surface forms. Since a [pada] is defined as either a nom. stem + SUP or a verbal stem + tiN, one has to derive the position of the [pada] accent from the process of derivation. The accent proper to the last element which is introduced in the deep structure generally marks the [pada] accent. As an illustration we may take the case of the third person singular of the Present Indicative of the verbal stem bhú which bears the udatta accent: bhú+1AT = bhú+SaP+tiP = bhó+a+ti. Since the class marker [SaP] and the l-substitute [tiP] are P-IT-s they are both anudatta. So the resulting form is bháv-a-ti. Similarly in the case of suN which is anudatta, su+IAT su+nú+tiP su-nó-ti since by 1.2.4 the class marker [Snu] of the su-class is a N-IT and prevents a guna replacement of stem final [u] while that of the class marker is so replaced. When we come to consider the situation in the deep structures bhú+SaP+tás, su+śnú+tás: bhó+a+tás bhav-a-tas, su-nu-tas, the place of the accent has to be determined, since in both illustrations there 
xlii 
= 
= 
= 
== 
are two of the three elements bearing their own accents. The normal position is that of the last accented member so that we have su-nu-tás, with the udatta on the last syllable of the surface form. In the normal course the same thing should have happened in the case of bháv-a-tas. But a special rule prevents the accent falling on accented l-substitutes, cf. 6.1.186, which indicates that accented 1-substitutes lose their accent when introduced, so that themes ending in short [a] retain their original accent. A stem having an accented syllable loses its accent if the theme. marker is accented: láN+Sná lu-ná-tiP; this accent of the theme is lost if the affix has an accent: lu-ni-tás. 5.4.11 introduces the affix [ám] after the comparative and superlative affixes: when it is introduced after this we have lu-ni-tas-tar-á-m. Though all sUP affixes are defined as anudatta (3.1.4), there are situations when they acquire the udatta ac- Thus 6.1.168 teaches that beginning with the instrumental sin- gular, all sUP affixes bear the udatta accent when introduced after nominal stems which are monosyllabic before the locative plural affix [sup]: 
vāk-sú (8.2.30; 3.59); vac-á/é/ás; väg-bhíḥ/bhyam/bhyas. When these stems enter into composition as final members, this rule is optional (6.1.169). 
vāc+ṣú

The accentual system as occurring in the Vedic texts and as described in the Ast. sometimes shows differences between the Vedic system and that current during Panini's time in the speech of the educated com- munity. For instance the pronominal stem sárva- bears the udatta ac- cent on the first syllable in Rg Veda, but Panini's rule [sarva-sya SUP-i 6.1.191] indicates that this is so only before sUP triplets; the inference is, therefore, that the word normally bears the accent on the second syl- lable. Again by [hrasva-nuT-bhyam matUP 6.1.176] the affix matUP is accented when introduced after a nominal stem which ends in a short ac- cented vowel. In the case of himá- 'snow' which is accented on the final syllable Panini's rule gives hima-vát- with the accent shifted to the affix, contra Vedic himá-vat bearing the accent on the final syllable preceding the affix. That accent did have a vital role in actual speech during Panini's time is also indicated by his rule 6.1.181: [vi-bhāṣ-a bhāṣā-y-am] very clearly. 
There are many homophonous elements having different functions. For instance [áC] stands for all vowels, as the siglum derived from SS 1-4 and it also stands for krt affix, with feminine in long [a] (3.1.134; 4.1.4) and also a taddhita affix (5.2.127), the marker [C] indicating the accent falling on the affix itself (6.1.163). There are two affixes [KtiN] and 
xliii 
[KtiC], the first deriving feminine stems with accent on the initial syl- lable (6.1.197) while the second generates stems with a precative sense (3.3.174). Affix [KtíC] also is not subject to the operation of 6.4.15 and 37. There are two affixes [tr] with markers [C] or [N], differing in the accentuation of the surface forms; affix [trN] is introduced after all verbal stems to denote the significances enumerated in 3.2.129: habitual disposition, age or capacity, (3.2.135) but [trC] to denote that the agent is worthy of the action (3.3.169) and can also occur after all verbal 
stems. 
Occasionally a doubt may arise regarding the function of an element. As an instance we may note the general replacement rule 7.1.1 whereby [yu, vu] are replaced respectively by [ana, aka]. By 6.4.88 the element [vuK] is introduced after the verbal stem [bhú-] before l-substitutes of [IUN and IIT]. There are a number of affixes containing the element [vu] such as [DvuN, NvuC, NvuL, vuk, vuC, vuÑ, vuN, SvuN]. To ar- rive at the proper interpretation of [vuK] introduced after the verbal stem [bhú-] interpretation is necessary that it is a final increment of the verbal stem and is not an affix. The interpretation of 7.1.1 draws on 7.1.2 which has the specification [praty-aya-adi-nam] and by a process known as [apa-kars-a-] introduces this term from the following sutra, contra the normal system of [anu-vrt-ti-] where one derives the word from a preceding sutra to fill in the ellipsis. 
The technical term [praty-ay-a-] implies that it is that element which gives the full meaning of the finished expression. In the case of [vuK] which is introduced after the verbal stem [bhú-] it is not a [praty-aya-] but a stem-final augment. The substituend is always in the sixth triplet, and one has to distinguish between a replacement and an augment. To some extent the markers [K, T and M] decide the case for an augment. 
Marker [N] of an element indicates that it is the substitute for the final phoneme of the substituend even when it is polyphonic (1.1.53). It is also a marker of the affix or element which when introduced after a nominal or verbal stem bars the operation of 1.1.5 (i.e., guna replacement). That is why in the case of nominal stems which are desig- nated by the t.t. GHI (i.e., those ending in short i or u) undergo that transformation despite marker [N]. The same is true of the aorist marker [aN] when introduced after verbal stems ending in [r] and the stem [drs-] (7.4.16). Similarly the siglum [aN] and affix [aN] are easily indentifiable from the contexts. Where this is not possible, the metarule mentioned by Patanjali that in case of doubt one must have recourse to 
xliv 
interpretation operates. This system of interpretation must have arisen at the very time of the oral transmission of the Ast. and the genesis of such interpretation must be the basis of much critical work that followed its composition. The works of Katyayana and Patanjali are continua- tions of that tendency to make clear what is not so easily discernible on account of the style of Ast. The additional rules which are appended in these later works are an example of noting the changes in the language which must have taken place after Panini's time, though in some cases, they have been lapses in the original text. 
In a work of such magnitude which covers every aspect of the author's speech community, systematized on the basis of mnemonic rules, there is indeed much scope to find some overstatements as well as understatements. But none of this takes away from the credit which is due to Panini who, in this astounding work, has set up a model which is fully adequate to cover every aspect of the language described. Because of its importance, all earlier works in this field gradually disappeared. Ast. in its turn became the focal point of much critical and explicatory work over the last two millennia. That is a universe by itself, but its ap- peal is to the specialist. However, Katyayana and Patanjali, along with Panini are the three great teachers accepted by all subsequent au- thorities, and the whole Paninian system is designated sometimes as tri-muni vy-a-kar-ana-m. Regarding the authority of this triumvirate, later tradition lays down the law: yath-o-t-taram muni-n-am pra-man-ya-m 'according to the greater authority of the succeeding sages'. 
Since interpretation is the ultimate source for the explication of the original su-tra-s of Panini, several metalinguistic principles were developed, some of which are due to Panini himself. A majority of these, technically known as [pari-bhasa-s], are due to Katyayana and Patanjali. A collection of these was assembled and commented upon by Nagojibhatta and they help one in understanding the intricacies of Panini's grammar. 
The broad principles of interpretation have been laid down by Patanjali in his Mahābhāṣya. In his passage discussing the nature of grammar as presented by Panini he has the following passage: na hi su-tra-ta eva sabd-a-n prati-pad-y-a-nte; kim tarhi? vy-a-khya-na-tas ca; nanu tad eva su-tra-m vi-grh-i-ta-m vy-a-khya-na-m bhav-a-ti? na keval-a-n-i carca-pad-a-n-i vy-a-khya-na-m "urddhi-h+aT + aiC"-iti. Kim tarhi? ud-a-har-ana-m, praty-ud-a-har-ana-m, vak-ya-adhy- 
xlv 
a-har-a ity etat sam-ud-i-ta-m vy-a-khya-na-m bhav-a-ti (MBh. I 11,20-23). 'One does not derive words by referring only to the su-tra-s. What then? By interpretation also. But is not that the same sutra broken into its several constituent elements which constitutes interpreta- tion? No, the separation of the constituent elements does not constitute interpretation (such as separating the words [vrddhi-ḥ, aT, aiC] of the first su-tra). What then? Examples, counter-examples, filling in the ellip- sis, these together constitute interpretation.' It is out of this type of in- terpretation that one brings out the full implication of each su-tra. To understand fully the nature of this interpretation we may illustrate it with an example. Panini 1.2.4 reads as follows: sarva-dha-tu-ka-m (3.4.113) a-P-IT. Interpretation of this sutra then is as follows: a-P-IT sarva-dha-tu-ka-m [N-IT 1.2.1]-N-IT-vat bhav-a-ti: kr +1AT = kr+ú+tás (3.1.79, 4.78) kar-u+tás (7.3.84)- kur-u-tás (6.4.110); a-P-IT-iti kim? kr+u+tip kar-ó-ti (7.3.84). First the ellipsis is filled in by the expres- sion [N-IT] of 1.2.1 recurring in this rule by the process of [anu-vrt-ti] and supplying the copula. Then follows the illustration of this rule, with an affix which is clearly not marked by [P] as IT. Lastly the question regarding the restraint [a-P-IT] is illustrated by the surface form generated with the affix [tiP]. This in short is how the sutra is to be in- terpreted. Beyond this normal style of interpretation, both the Varttika-s and Mahābhāṣya go deeper into the construction of the su-tra-s and question the validity of each expression therein in relation to the situations indicated in other related su-tra-s. Modifications are sug- gested and then denied, maintaining the original status of the su-tra. In a few cases the modifications suggested have been accepted as the basic text in the Käsikā. But these are few as compared to the large number of them which occur without such modifications. The theoretical development of linguistic philosophy dates precisely from Patanjali's Mahabhāṣya and finds its apex in Bhartṛhari's Vakya-pad-iya. These are the standard original works in the field of Sanskrit grammar, form- ing the basis of later expository treatises. But at the very back of all these lies Panini's great work which must be studied first by means of his own metalinguistic techniques.

Aṣṭādhyāyī of Panini 
atha sabdanusāsanam 
Now begins instruction (anusásanam) pertaining to articulatory speech (sabda-°). 
As preliminary to the main corpus of Astädhyayŕ there is a repertory of phonemes divided into fourteen strings (sütra-s) forming a distinct part popularly known as Siva-sutras (SS) or Maheśvara-sutras (MS) and commonly referred to as Pratyahāra-sütras (PS), because of their capacity to generate pratyaharás or sigla representing groups of phonemes which enter into any par- ticular grammatical operation, in order to produce an economy of statement. The whole object of Astadhyayf is to effect an economy of statement and thus dispense with the normal arrangement of given topics. These SS are not a part of the Astädhyayf, but are traditionally associated with its corpus. Tradition- ally the authorship of SS, as the name implies, is ascribed to the divine Śiva or Mahesvara. Even the introductory statement which precedes them is part of the great commentary, the Mahabhaṣyá of Patanjali.

The sigla listed above are derived by applying 1.3.2-3 along with 1.1.71 (q.vv.). The capital letters at the end of each sutra are IT markers (1.3.3) while the un- derlined vowels are used for ease of pronunciation to denote the consonantal phonemes. It may be noted that this repertory of phonemes (akṣara-samamnäyá) does not include long and prolated or extra long (cf. 1.2.27 below) vowels or the anusvärá, visargá (or visarjaniya), jihva-mülfya and upadhmaniya or the supra-segmental phonemes of accent. The vowels represent phoneme classes, rather, involving features of length, +nasality and three ac- 
cents. 
Though the number of sigla can run into three figures, those actually needed for grammatical operations in the corpus of Astadhyayf are 41 (or 42 if rA is in- cluded according to later Paniniyas). These sigla, in their alphabetical order

S1.1.1 vid-dhir aT=aiC 
(The technical term = t.t.) vŕd-dhi denotes the vowel phonemes long ã (= aT) and the diphthongs ai, au (= aiC). 
= 
1. aT long vowel class a (by 1.1.70 below) with supra-segmental features of three accents and Inasality. Unmarked vowels by marker T stand for their class, as- sociated with the supra-segmental features of length (-3): short (hrasvá), long (=dirghá) and extra-long or prolated (plutá) (1.2.27), and accent (=3): udátta 'high-pitched', ánudatta low-pitched' and svaritá rising and falling tone or circumflex' (1.2.29-31), nasality. The short vowels have a duration of one mora, the long of two and the prolated of three mora, while consonants have half a mora each. By 1.1.70 aiC following the marker T of aT represents the diphthongs ai, au, having a duration of two moras only. 
2. as a non-technical term vfd-dhi denotes 'increase, growth, interest (on principal), 
etc. Cf. 5.1.47. 
3. as a t.t. vfd-dhi occurs in 1.1.3-6,73; 6.1.88-92; 2.105; 7.2.1-7,114-18; 3.1-35, 
89-90. 
1.1.2 aT=eŃ gunáh 
(The t.t.) guna denotes the vowel phonemes short a (aT) and the diphthongs e, o (eŇ). 
1. aT represents the short phoneme-class a, having a duration of one mora while eN following marker T of aT represents phoneme-class e, o of two mora duration. 
2. as a non-t.t. guná signifies 'quality, attribute, characteristic' 2.2.11; 3.23, and in the compounds guná-kartsnyá 'whole or entire quality' 6.2.93; guná-pratisedhá- 'denial or negation of a quality' 6.2.155, guná-vácana- 'attributive, adjective' 2.1.30; 4.1.44; 3.58; 5.1.124; 6.2.24, 8.1.12; it also denotes 'fold, times' 5.4.29. 3. as a t.t. guná occurs in 1.1.3-6; 6.1.87,97; 4.126,146,156; 7.3.82-88,91; 
4.10-11,16,21,29,30,57,75,82. 
1.1.3 iKo guná-vrd-dhí 
When the t.t. guná (2) and vfd-dhi (1) are introduced as replacements (and the substituendum is not specified), they replace only the vowels denoted by the siglum iK (= i, u, r and !). 
The expression iKah, ending in the sixth triplet (=genitive) is expected to recur when it is not specified, with the use of the t.tt. guná and vfd-dhi. For example 7.3.84 sarvadhatuka-ardhadhātukáyoh (gunáh 82) and 86 puK-anta-laghu= upadhásya ca (gunáh 82) specify only the pre-affixal base (-anga 6.4.1) in the genitive (1.1.49) as the substituendum; by this meta-rule the expression iKah recurs here, denoting the actual substituendum. Thus bhú+SaP: bho+a: bháv-a 
7 
(6.1.77) before l-substitutes of the Present System (3.4.78). Similarly by 7.2.1. siCi vfd-dhih parasmaipadéṣu we have the expression iKah recurring with vfd-dhi to denote the specific substituendum: krN+sio+1-substitutes of Parasmaipadá: á-kr+s+t: a-kar-s-IT-t (6.4.71; 7.3.96) á-kär-8-1-t (8.3.59). 
1.1.4 ná dhatulopé-árdhadhātuke 
[Guná and Vfd-dhi replacements 3] do not (ná) operate before an árdhadhatuka affix which conditions a zero replacement (lópa) of a verbal base (dhátu-°). 
árdhadhätuka is defined by 3.4.114 as affixes other than those of the Present System (3.4.113). Thus luN+yaŃ (3.1.22) lo-la-yá (6.1.9 for reduplication and 7.4.82 for guná replacement of the vowel of the reduplicated syllable) is a derived verbal base (3.1.32) from which an agent noun is derived by introducing the affix áC (3.1.134): lo-la-yá+áC; by 2.4.74 the marker yáN is replaced by zero (0) be- fore a vowel: lo-lü-yá+ác: lo-lu-0-áC and the guná replacement ruled in by 7.3.84 does not take place so that the expected form lo-luv-á- is realized by 
6.4.77. 
1.1.5 K-N-ITi ca 
And (ca) [guná and vfd-dhi replacements 3 are not 4 conditioned] before affixes marked with K or N as an IT. 
According to Paniniyas the expression K-N-ITi stands for *G-K-N-ITi for reasons 
which will be indicated below. 
1. Before l-substitutes of the Present System (sárvadhätuka 3.4.113) the class of verbal stems beginning with tudÀ vyathane (DhP VI 1) 'torment, inflict pain' has the class marker Sá (3.1.77) which, by 1.2.4 is deemed as marked with N as IT; thus tud+Sá+tiP (3.4.78) = tud-á-ti and consequently 7.3.86 does not operate here. Similarly kr+Ktá-: kr-tá- 'done, accomplished'. 
2. The only exception is with regard to taddhita affix marker K as IT which con- ditions vid-dhi replacement in the initial syllable of a nominal stem (7.2.118). 3. G as an IT-marker which does not condition guná or vfd-dhi replacement is in- troduced to explain forms like stha-snú- as derived from stha+"Genú- (3.2.138 gla-ji-sthas ca *G-Ksnúh) which is rendered Ksnú- by 8.4.55; if the marker had been K instead of *G the final phoneme of [stha-] would have been replaced by i according to 6.4.66. *G is also considered as an IT-marker in 3.2.138. 
8 
1.1.6 'dīdhi-vevī=3iTām 
[Guná and Vfd-dhi replacements 3 are not conditioned 4 with reference to the following substituenda]: the verbal bases dīdhi- 'shine', vevi- 'be agitated' and the initial increment iT. 
= 
1. a+didhi+NeuL (3.1.133): d+didhi+aka (7.1.1) a-didhy-áka- 'shining', despite marker N which should condition vfd-dhi by 7.2.115. Similarly a+vevI+Noul = a-vevy-áka- 'trembling'. 
2. bhu+UT: bhu+tás+miP: bhu+it+tás-mi (3.1.33 for tas and 3.4.78 for miP and 7.2.35 for iT) bho+i-tás+mi bhav-i-tás-mi but 7.3.84 does not operate on iT. 
= 
1.1.7 haLah-ánantaraḥ samyogáḥ 
(The t.t.) samyoga 'conjunction' denotes an uninterrupted (ánantaraḥ) sequence of consonants (haLah): 
1. "uninterrupted" by vowels defines a conjunct; up to five consonants is normal: ánna-(2) food', stri-(3) 'woman; feminine gender'; kárenya-(4) 'blackness, darkness'; kártsnya-(5) 'totality, whole'. 
2. as a t.t. occurs in 1.2.5; 4.11; 6.1.3; 4.10,62,68,82,106,166; 7.2.43; 4.10,29; 
8.2.23,43. 
1.1.8 mukha-nasika-vácanaḥ=ánunāsikaḥ 
(The t.t.) ánunasika- 'nasal' denotes a phoneme articulated simul- taneously through the oral and nasal cavities (mukha-nasika-vácana-). 
1. nasal vowels: ã, ã, 1, 1, etc. 2. nasal stops: ñ, m, n, п, n. 
3. nasal semi-vowels: y, 1, v. 
1.1.9 túlya-asya-prayatnam sávarnam 
(The t.t.) sávarna homogeneous' designates phonemes which produced by the same articulatory effort (túlya-prayatná-) at the same point of articulation in the oral cavity (ásya-). 
1. túlya 'same, similar, equivalent'. 
= 
2. asyà 'oral cavity but ásya-2 asyèl bhava- asyà1+yàT 5.1.6 'point of ar- ticulation in the oral cavity'. Five points of articulation are recognized: velum (kanthá-), soft palate (tálu-), hard palate (mürdhán-), teeth ridge (dánta-) and lips (óstha-). Our corpus has ósthya- (7.1.102) 'labial', dántya- (7.3.73) 'dental' and murdhanyà (8.3.55) but not kánthya- 'velar' or talavyà- 'palatal'; on the 
9 
other hand 4.3.62 derives the word jivha-mulfya- formed at the root of the tongue'. 
3. prayatná 'articulatory effort or process' is two-fold: abhyantará- 'intra-buccal' and báhya- 'extra-buccal'; the first again is four-fold: sprstá- 'close contact' for stops, Isát-sprsta slight contact' for semi-vowels or resonants, Tsád-vivṛta- 'slight openness' for fricatives, and vivrtá- fully open' for vowels. The principal extra-buccal efforts are associated with voice (glottal), aspiration (pulmonic), and nasality (nasal). Openness and constriction of the glottis, relating to voicelessness and voice respectively, are designated vivärá- and samvärá-, and the three accents: udátta- 'high-pitched or rising tone', ánudätta- 'low-pitched or falling tone' and svaritá- 'rising and falling tone, circumflex', a combination of the preceding two, associated with vowels constitute eleven aspects of this ar- ticulatory process. Though not involved in the definition of sávarnya- or homogeneity, they are taken into consideration when replacement takes place ac- cording to 1.1.50. 
4. as a t.t. occurs in 1.1.58,69; 6.1.101,102-6,127; 4.78; 7.1.39; 8.4.58. 
1.1.10 ná=aC=haLau 
A vowel (aC) and a consonant (haL) [which satisfy the above condition 9] are (nevertheless) not (ná) (homogeneous 9). 
In consequence of this, in the expression dadhi+sitam 'cold curds' samdhi or eu- phonic combination does not take place as taught in 6.1.101 between -i+s-", though both are homogeneous by 9 above. 
1.1.11 TT=uT-eT-dvivacanam pragghyam 
(The t.t.) pragfhya denotes [final 1.1.52]-1, -u or -e of dual endings (dvi-vacanám). 
1. By 6.1.125 pragghya vowels are not subject to replacement before other vowels as conditioned by sámhita (6.1.72) or euphonic combinatory rules; thus we have ex- pressions like agni iti, väyú iti, phále iti, pácete iti, where the first three expres- sions ending in the dual cases and the fourth ending in the dual personal verbal affix are pragfhya vowels. 
2. As a t.t. occurs in 6.1.125; 8.2.107; 4.57, and recurs by anuvftti in the rules 12-19 
below. 
1.1.12 adáso māt 
[(The t.t.) pragghya denotes vowels -1, u and -e 11] occurring after the phoneme [m] which is part of the nominal base adás- 'that'. 
10 
Thus no samdhí replacement takes place in the expressions amí ásáte, amú äsáte 
they two (respectively m. and f.) sit down'. 
1.1.13 Se 
[(The t.t.) pragghya 11] denotes the ending Se (7.1.39). 
This affix is a replacement for SUP triplets (3.4.78) in Vedic. The Vedic examples are: tvé iti, asmé indra-bfhaspatí. 
1.1.14 nipatá éka-aC-án-aŃ 
[(The t.t.) pragghya 11 denotes] a particle (nipatá-) consisting of a single. vowel (éka+aC) with the exception of áN. 
1. i indram pasya, u úttistha 'look at Indra', 'get up'. 
2. The particle á with marker N denotes the senses of (1) a little (Tsad-arthá), (2) connection with activity (kriya-yogé), (3-4) exclusive limit (maryáda) and in- clusive limit (abhividhí); but without the marker it signifies (5) emphasis of a sentence as an expletive (vakyà) and (6) reminiscence (smárana): á evám nu mányase (5); á evám kila tát (6) 'thou dost certainly consider thus'; 'such indeed. was then the cause'. 
1.1.15 oT 
[(The t.t.) pragfhya denotes 11 a particle 14] (ending in 1.1.72) the diphthong [o]. 
aho Tsah 'lo, the Lord'; this rule applies to particles consisting of more than one 
syllable, since monosyllabic particles are already covered by the preceding rule.. 
1.1.16 sambúddhau śákalyasya itau-án-arṣe 
[(The t.t.) pragghya denotes 11] a vocative-(final 1.1.72) before the ex- pression iti which is not a part of the Vedic text (án-ars-e) according to (the grammarian) Śákalya. 
By quoting the name of the teacher Sákalya this rule is considered as optional. Panini (P.) uses this device in two ways: (a) either as a mark of respect (pujarthé) or (b) to indicate the optional nature of the rule (vibhāṣarthé), váyo iti/váyau iti (6.1.78). 
1.1.17 uÑaḥ 
[According to the grammarian Śákalya 16 (the t.t.) pragfhya 11 denotes the particle 14] uN (= u followed by the marker Ñ) [before non-Vedic iti 16]. 
11 
uiti/v-iti (6.1.77 according to other grammarians). 
1.1.18 ū 
[According to the grammarian Śákalya 16 (the t.t.) pragŕhya 11 denotes the particle 14] u [which replaces uN 17 (1.1.49)]. 
Originally sutras 17-18 constituted a single sutra which Katyayana proposed to 
divide into two by a process known as yoga-vibhagá 'splitting of one rule into parts'. According to Sákalya this a is optionally substituted for uN and is pragfhya: u iti, a iti/v-iti. 
1.1.19 IT-T-au ca saptamy-arthé 
[(The t.t.) pragfhya denotes 11] expressions (ending in 1.1.72) long -1 or -u which have the meaning of the seventh triplet of nominal endings (SUP 4.1.2). 
By 7.1.39 1(=luk) replaces SUP triplets in Vedic: sómo gaurí ádhi śritáḥ 'Soma has come to rest on the she-buffalo (skin)'; ádhy asyám mamakí tanú in this, my body'. 
1.1.20 1da-2dha GHU-á-daP 
(The t.t.) GHU denotes (verbal stems of the form) dã or dhã except those. which have the shape of da and are marked with P (as IT). 
GHU bases are: DU-daÑ dáne III 9, DU-dhaN dhárana-pósanayoh III 10, do 
avakhandane IV 40, daN dáne I 977, deŇ ráksane I 1011 and dheT páne I 951.. daP represents daP lávane II 50, daiP sódhane I 971. 
As a t.t. occurs in 1.2.17; 2.4.77; 3.3.92; 6.4.66,67,113,119; 7.3.70; 4.46-7,54; 8.4.17. 
1.1.21 ady-antavát-ékasmin 
When a grammatical operation applies to a single phoneme unit (ékasmin), it is treated as though it were the initial (adi) or final (anta) (of a similar polyphonic expression). 
3.1.3 [ady-udattas cal provides that the initial syllable of an affix bears the udátta accent: e.g., -távya- (kar-távya-); similarly the affix áN as a patronymic affix consisting of a single vowel phoneme is, by this rule, regarded as the initial: upagu+áNaupagav-á- 'descendant of Upagu'. 7.3.102 (sUPi ca) provides that nominal stem final -a is replaced by a before nominal endings beginning with y-, bh-; under the governing rule 6.4.1 (ángasya) this rule applies to the 
12 
ánga-final vowel, but in the case of a+bhyam a-bhyam the substitute stem (for idám 7.2.113) consists of a single phoneme al which, by this rule is now regarded as ánga-final. 
1.1.22 taraP-tamaPau GHAḥ 
(The t.t.) GHA denotes the affixes taraP and tamaP. 
These represent the general comparative (5.3.57) and superlative (5.3.55) affixes. As a t.t. occurs in 5.4.11; 6.3.17,43; 8.2.17. 
1.1.23 'bahú-'ganá-vatU-Dáti samkhyá 
(The t.t.) samkhyá denotes (the nominal bases) bahú- 'many', ganá- 'group' and expressions (ending in 1.1.72) affixes vatU(P) [5.2.39] and Dáti [5.2.41]. 
1. This t.t. covers a sub-class of nominal stems consisting of number words or 
numerals. 
2. As a t.t. occurs in 2.1.10,19,50; 3.2.21; 4.1.26,135; 5.1.19,22,39,58; 2.42,47; 3.42; 
4.1.17,43,85,89.140; 6.2.35,163; 3.47,110; 7.3.15. 
1.1.24 s-ná-antā SAT 
(The t.t.) SAT denotes [a sub-class of samkhya 23] (ending in 1.1.72) -s or -n (when first encountered). 
0 
1. These are: sás (6), páñcan (5), saptán (7), astán (8), návan (9), dásan (10), 
2. As a t.t. occurs in 4.1.10; 6.1.175; 7.1.22,55. 
1.1.25 Dáti ca 
(The t.t. SAT 24 denotes samkhya 23 expressions) [ending in 1.1.72] the affix Dáti also (ca). 
7.1.22 [sadbhyo luK] provides for the replacement of nominative and accusative. 
plural sUP affixes introduced after this sub-class of numerals. 
1.1.26 Ktá-KtávatŪ nisthá 
(The t.t.) nisthá denotes the affixes Ktá (3.4.70) and KtávatU. 
1. These affixes generate the past passive and active participles respectively. 
2. As a t.t. occurs in 2.2.36-7,69; 3.2.102; 6.1.22-28;205; 2.2.110,169; 4.52,60,95; 
7.2.14-34,47,50; 8.2.42. 
13 
1.1.27 sarvá-ādīni sarvanāmáni 
(The t.t.) sarvanāmán 'pronominal stem' denotes the class of nominal bases whose first member is sarvá- 'all'. 
1. Such a list is called a ganá and a repertory of such ganás constitutes a supple- ment to this corpus under the title Gana-patha, corresponding to a similar list of verbal stems designated Dhätu-pätha. 
2. As a t.t. occurs in 2.3.37; 5.3.2,7,8,10,23,71; 6.3.91; 7.1.14-17,52; 3.114. 
1.1.28 vibhāṣā dik-samāsé bahuvrīhaú 
[(The t.t.) sarvanamán 27] optionally (vibhāṣa) denotes a bahuvrīhí com- pound (2.2.23ff.) formed with direction words (dik-samāsá). 
Thus in the bahuvrihí compound úttara-purva 'north-eastern', the dative singular can either be úttara-pürvayai (as a substantive) or úttara-purvasyai (as a pronominal). 
1.1.29 ná bahuvrīhaú 
[(The t.t.) sarvanamán 27] does not (ná) denote [the class of words whose first member is sarvá- 27] occurring (at the end of 1.1.72) a bahuvrīhí (compound). 
Example (Ex.): priyá-visva- 'beloved of all' has the dative singular form 
priya-viévaya as against -visvasmai. 
1.1.30 tṛtīya-samāse 
[(The t.t.) sarvanamán 27 does not denote 29 the class of words whose first member is sarvá- 27] occurring (at the end of 1.1.72) a tatpurusá 2.1.22 (compound) the prior member of which ends in the (1.1.72) third SUP triplet (i.e., the instrumental case 2.1.30). 
másena púrvasmai = mása-pūrvaya (2.1.31) 'prior by a month'. 
1.1.31 dvaṁdvé ca 
(The t.t.) sarvanamán 27 does not denote 29 a member of the class of words whose first member is sarvá- 27] co-occurring (at the end 1.1.72) of a Dvamdvá (compound 2.2.29). 
purvesam ca páresam ca purva-paránam 'of the former and the latter'; instead of 
= 
14 
the normal genitive plural in -sam (7.1.52) the regular n-am (7.1.54) as- sociated with nominal stems is introduced after the dvamdvá compound. 
1.1.32 vibhāṣa Jasi 
[(The t.t.) sarvanamán 27] optionally (vibhāṣa) denotes [the class of words whose first member is sarvá- 27, (occurring at the end of 1.1.72) a dvaṁdvá compound 31] before (the nominative plural SUP ending) Jas. 
7.1.17 [Jasah Si] provides for a replacement of Jas by ST when introduced after. pronominals ending in short -a; so we have dakṣinottare/dakṣinottaráh 'southern and northern'. 
1.1.33 'prathamá-'caramá-taya='álpa="ardhá-"katipayá- 7némāś ca 
[(The t.t.) sarvanamán 27 optionally denotes 32] the words prathamá- 'first', caramá- 'last', expressions (ending in 1.1.72) the affix-taya(P 5.2.42), álpa 'small', ardhá- 'half', katipayá- 'some', and néma- 'half' [before affix Jas 32]. 
Thus we have the following examples: prathame/prathamáh; caramé/caramah; 
dvítaye/dvítayah; álpe/álpah; ardhe/ardhah; katipayé/katipayah; néme/némah. 
1.1.34 púrva-pára-ávara-dákṣina-úttara-ápara-ádharāni vyavastháyam á-samjñāyām 
[(The t.t.) sarvanamán 27 optionally denotes 32] the words púrva- 'front, eastern', pára- 'subsequent', ávara- 'lower, more recent', dákṣina- 'right, southern', úttara- 'upper, northern', ápara- 'behind, western', ádhara- 'lower' [before affix Jas 32] provided they are employed in the sense of relative situation (vyavastha) and not used as proper names (ásaṁjñāyām). 
Though they are already pronominals by their inclusion in the class of words begin- ning with sarvá- [27], they function optionally so before affix Jas: púrve/púrvah; páre/párah; ávare/ávarah; dáksine/dáksinah; úttare/úttarah; ápare/áparah; ádhare/ádharah; but dákṣine imé gáthakaḥ 'these singers are expert'; similarly úttaráh kúravah 'n.pr. of a country'. 
15 
1.1.35 svám a-'jñāti-'dhana=ākhyāyām 
[(The t.t.) sarvanāmán 27 optionally denotes 32] (the pronominal base) svá- when not signifying jñáti 'kin' or dhána- 'wealth' [as a proper name 34 before the affix Jas 32]. 
In this particular situation svá- signifies 'own': sve/svah putráh 'one's own sons', 
but svah 'kinsfolk', prabhutáḥ sváh 'extensive possessions, assets or wealth'. 
1.1.36 ántaram bahiryogá=upasaṁvyáayoh 
[(The t.t.) sarvanamán 27 optionally denotes 32] (the pronominal stem) ántara- [before affix Jas 32] when it signifies connection with the exterior (bahir-yogá-) or under-clothing (upasamyána). 
1. ántara- is a regular member of this class, but optionally so before the affix Jas in these two meanings, but in its normal meaning of 'between' it is necessarily a pronominal stem 
2. ánrare/ántaráh-gráh 'houses situated at the extremity (of the village)"; similarly 
ántare/ántarah sáṭakaḥ 'under-garments'. 
1.1.37 svàr-ādi-nipatam ávyayam 
[(The t.t.)] ávyaya- 'indeclinable' denotes members of the class headed by svår- 'sun' as well as particles (nipātá). 
1. Nipatás 'particles' are listed in 1.4.57-96 below. 
2. As a t.t. occurs in 1.1.38-41; 4.67; 2.1.6; 2.11,20,25; 3.69; 4.82; 3.4.59; 4.1.16; 
2.104; 3.23; 5.3.71; 4.11,86; 6.2.2,168; 3.66; 8.3.46. 
1.1.38 taddhitás ca á-sarva-vibhaktiḥ 
[(The t.t.) ávyaya 37] denotes derivatives (ending in 1.1.72) a taddhitá (4.1.78ff.) 'secondary nominal affix' after which not all [SUP triplets 1.4.103] (vibhakti 1.4.104) endings are introduced. 
tad +feminine affix+ sing./du./pl. ablative endings tá-tas where the vibhakti af- 
fix tasil is introduced by 5.3.7 as a replacement for the fifth sUP triplets. 
1.1.39 kŕt=m=éC=antaḥ 
[(The t.t.) ávyaya denotes 37] expressions derived with kft [3.1.93] affixes (ending in 1.1.72) -m or -eC (= e, o, ai, au). 
D 
161. Kft affixes are primary affixes deriving nominal stems from verbal bases; those ending in -m are: tumuN, (kár-tum 'to do'), NamuL (svadum-káram 'having sweeteness'). 
2. Kft affixes ending in -eC are: -áse, -aseN and -tavai/tave as indicated by the examples jivase/jívase 'to live' kar-táve 'to do', apabhas-i-tavaí, mlecch- i-tavaí 'to speak indistinctly' [3.4.9,14]. 
1.1.40 Ktvá-tosuN-KasuNaḥ 
[(The t.t.) ávyaya 37 denotes] expressions (ending in 1.1.72) the affixes Ktvá, tosuN and KasuN. 
Ktvá is a kft affix introduced by 3.4.18ff. to generate absolutives: kr-tvá 'having done'; similarly for the other affixes: kár-tos (3.4.16) 'doing', a-tfd-as (3.4.17) 'piercing'. 
1.1.41 avayībhāvás=ca 
And [(the t.t.) avyaya denotes 37] 'the adverbial compound' avyayibhāvá (2.1.5-21). 
By including this type of compound as a member of the indeclinable (ávyaya) class, feminine and declensional affixes [aP and SUP 2.4.82] are replaced by 01 (luk) when introduced after it. 
1.1.42 Śi sarvanāma-sthānám 
(The t.t.) sarvanama-sthaná 'strong case ending' denotes (the replace- ment affix) Si (for Jas and Śas 7.1.20). 
1. The expression sarvanama-sthaná indicates a situation in which the operation ap- 
plies to the whole nominal stem and implies the 'strong case ending'. 
2. As a t.t. occurs in 1.4.17; 6.1.170,199; 7.1.70,86; 3,110. 
= 
3. exx.: dádhi+Jas/Śas = dádhi+Si (7.1.20) dádhi-n+Si (7.1.72) 
(6.4.8). 
1.1.43 SUT á-napumsakasya 
= dádhi-n-i 
[(The t.t.) sarvanama-sthaná denotes 42] (the SUP triplets comprised by the siglum) SUT (= SU, au. Jas, am, auT) introduced after a nominal stem other than a neuter one (i.e., masculine and feminine only). 
rájan+sU = rájan+sU (6.4.8) = rajan +0 (6.1.68)= rája-+0 (8.2.7).

153 
S 
1.1.44 ná va=iti vibhāṣā 
(The t.t.) vibhāṣā denotes the meaning of the combined particles ná và 'or not' (literally 'not or') and signifies optionality. 
1. There are three types of optional rules: (a) á-prapte vibhāṣā provides optionally what would not obtain otherwise; (b) präpté vibhāṣā makes optional what has been provided by another rule; (c) ubhayátra vibhasa is a combination of the first two. (a) is illustrated by 32 above. 
2. As a t.t. occurs in 1.1.28,32; 2.3,16,36; 3.50,77,85; 4.12,16,25,50,78 etc. 
1.1.45 iK-yaNah samprasaranam 
(The t.t.) samprasarana 'vocalization' denotes the vowel phonemes (comprised by the siglum) iK (= i,u,r, 1) (replacing the semi-vowels com- prised by the siglum) yaN (= y,v,r,1) (respectively 1.3.10). 
1. yaj+Ktá 
= 
iaj+Ktá (6.1.15) 
= 
= 
iaj+Ktá (6.1.15) ij+Ktá (6.1.108) is+Ktá is-tá- 'spoken, uttered'. Similarly vac+Ktá uk-tá 'spoken, uttered'. 
2. As a t.t. occurs in 3.3.72; 5.2.55; 6.1.13-20,22-26, 30-32,34,37-44,108; 3.139; 4.131; 
7.4.67, 
1.1.46 ady-antau Ta-K-ITau 
(An increment) marked with T as IT constitutes the initial (adí) of the unit to which it is added, and one marked with K as IT constitutes the final (ánta). 
1. The phonological changes which take place in morphology are of two kinds: re- placement of phonemes or addition of phonemes to the base when affixes are in- troduced. Deletion of phonemes is regarded as replacement by 0. The sub- stituendum is always accompanied by the sixth sUP triplet (in the genitive case: 49 below). 
2. The increment iT associated with árdhadhatuka affixes beginning with val (7.2.35) is an initial increment: bhú+tum bhú+iT-tum bháv+i-tum becomes the initial of the affix tumuN. 
=== 
3. Before the affix of the present participle middle-ana- verbal themes ending in short-a get an increment muK (7.3.82) where m constitutes the final of the verbal theme: edh+SaP+ana- édha-m+ana- 'growing'; if this increment were considered as a part of the affix -ana (= mana-) the theme-final short a of édh-a- would be replaced by the corresponding long vowel by 7.3.102 and result in an unacceptable form. 
18 
1.1.47 M-IT=aCaḥ-ántyat páraḥ 
(An increment) marked with M as IT is inserted after the last (ántya) vowel (aC) of the expression to which it is added. 
1. rudh+ŚnáM (3.1.78) -ru-ná-dh-ru-ná-dh (8.4.2) 'obstruct, hinder'.. 
2. Increments with marker T are: aT, aT, IT, IT, hamuT tuT, dhuT, nuT, yaT, yasuT, yiT, yuT, ruT, siyuT, suT, syaT; increments with marker K are: aduK, asuk, anuk, ithuK, kuK, juK, tuK, tithuK, tuK, thuK, duK, nik, nuk, puK, muk, yak, yuk, riK, riK, ruK, luK, vuK, suK, saK; increments with marker M are: aM, iM, uM, nuM, puM, raM, ŚnáM. 
1.1.48 eCa iK-hrasva-ādese 
When (the t.t.) hrasvá (1.2.27) is used to denote a short vowel (hrasvá 1.2.28) of vowel phonemes (designated by the siglum) eC (= e, o, ai, au) (and the substitute is not specified) it is one of the vowel phonemes denoted by the siglum iK (= i, u). 
1. Though the siglum iK contains the additional vowels and Į, they are not re- quired for the statement of this rule; a new siglum iN1 would have been more appropriate, but would have caused confusion, since with one exception (1.1.69) aN represents an1 while iN and other sigla ending in marker N operate with N2. 2. A bahuvrihí compound is an attributive word capable of taking all three genders; thus áti+rai 'which has surpassed riches', when taking the neuter gender, by 1.2.47 replaces the final long vowel ai by i yielding the form áti-ri-. Similarly by 1.2.48 in the bahuvrihí compound citrá+go the final -o is replaced by u, yielding the form citrá-gu- 'possessor of brindled cows'. 
1.1.49 sasthí sthāné-yoga 
The sixth (sasthí) SUP triplet is used to indicate that the expression after which it is introduced is the substituendum (sthāné-yoga). 
This is a metalinguistic rule governing the use of the genitive case in the corpus of Ast. This corpus makes use of three building blocks: the nominal stem (prátipadika 1.2.45), the verbal stem (dhátu 1.3.1; 3.1.32) and a set of affixes (praty-ayá 3.1.1-5.4.160) and a body of replacement rules which are context- sensitive. The genitive or sixth case, in its metalinguistic use, stands for the sub- stituendum on which the rule operates. Thus in the rule [áster bhúh 2.4.52] bhú- replaces as before árdhadhatuka affixes. On the other hand in 6.4.89 [aT=upadhaya góhah], though there are two genitives, the substituendum is the [upadhá] which is qualified by [góhah,] and the governing expression (ángasya 6.4.1] which recurs there gives the full expression as [góhah-áñgasya-upadhayah] makes it clear that the last genitive alone is the substituendum. 
19 
1.1.50 stháne-ántara-tamah 
(Where a choice has to be made) among possible replacements (sthane) that one is chosen which is most proximate (ántara-tama) to the sub- stituend. 
6.1.87 [at-gunáh] states that guná is the single substitute for the phoneme class [a] and the following vowel [aCi 6.1.71). By 1.1.2 the t.t. guná denotes the vowel phoneme-classes [a, e, o]; in the compound expression deva+indra-, -a+i- is to be replaced by one of these three members; the choice by this rule falls on e which is palato-velar and therefore most proximate to both a and i, but not on a 
which is velar or on o which is labio-velar. 
1.1.51 ur aN1 rÃ-paraḥ 
(A vowel represented by the siglum) aN (= a, i, u) [substituted in the place of 50] of vowel r (and !) is automatically followed by the phoneme r (and I respectively 1.3.10). 
1. 7.1.100 [Ta iT-dhátoh] provides for the replacement of vowel f of a verbal stem 
by short i(T): kr+sa+tiP - kir-á-ti 'scatters'.

2. hf+SaP+tip where is replaced by guná by 7.3.84 (sarva-dhatuka= ardhadhätukayoh (gunáh 82)], and since there is now a choice to be made from the three members of this class (1.1.2), by 50 above the closest is a which is of the same duration as that of the substituend and differs from it only in one fea- ture of articulation, while e, o differ from it in two features, and so we realize the expected form hár-a-ti 'removes'. Similarly 7.2.114 [mrjer vfd-dhih] provides for a víddhi (= a, ai, au by 1 above) replacement of the vowel (3 above) of the verbal stem mrj- 'wipe, clean' before sárvadhatuka affixes: mfj+01+tip= märj+tip since a like a above is the obvious choice for the reasons stated there, and we realize the expected form márs-ti (8.2.36; 4.41). 
3. The siglum rÃ, as indicated earlier, denotes the two lateral semi-vowels r and 1; consequently the guná substitute for I is al, and the vfddhi substitute is al: kĺp+SaP+te = kálp-a-te 'is able'. 
1.1.52 aLaḥ-ántyasya 
(A substitute replaces) the final (ántyasya) phoneme (of the substituend). 
7.2.102 [tyádādīnām ah] provides for the replacement of the sub-class of 
pronominals whose first member is tyád- 'that' before vibhákti (7.2.84 triplets); tyád+SU = tyáa+sUtyá+8U (6.1.97) sya+8 (7.2.106). 
= SUP 
20 
1.1.53 N-ITca 
[A polyphonic 55] substitute marked with N as IT [replaces the final phoneme of the substituend 52]. 
1. Sutra 55 below is an exception to 52 above and provides for the replacement of the whole substituend instead of its final phoneme; the present rule is a prior exception to that exception, so that by a reversal of the normal process of recur- rence (anuvŕtti) the expression polyphonous (áneka-aL) is anticipated here. 2. Substitutes with marker N are: anaN, ayaN, avaN, asuN, anaN, inaŃ, iyaN, 
uvaN, niŇ, nyaŃ, riN, гIN, SyaN. 
1.1.54 adéḥ párasya 
(When a substitute replaces a following substituend) it replaces its (párasya) initial phoneme (adéḥ). 
7.2.83 IT asah (anásya 82)] provides for the replacement of -äná-, the marker of the present participle middle by 1(T) when it is introduced after the verbal stem as- 'sit': as+0+aná-= de+iná- 'sitting'. 
1.1.55 áneka-aL SIT sárvasya 
A polyphonic (áneka-aL) substitute or (a monophonic one) with marker 
as IT replaces the whole of the substituend. 
Ś 
1. Substitutes which are not polyphonic but replace the whole of the substituend have to be monophonic which, contra 52 above do not replace the final phoneme when marked with S as IT. This is, therefore, an exception to 52 above. Such substitutes are as, iś, IS, eś, Si, Si, Se. 
2. 2.4.53 [bruvo vaciḥ] provides for the replacement of brü 'speak' by vac- before árdhadhätuka affixes, and being polyphonic, replaces the whole substituend: brū+tf = vac+tf-vak-tf- (8.2.30). 
1.1.56 sthanivád ädesáḥ-án-al-vidhau 
= 
1 
A replacement (adesá X) for a substituend (sthanín- Y) is treated like the substituend (sthanivát) except (án-) with regard to an opera- tion (vidhí) which would thereby apply and would be at the same time dependent on the original phoneme (aL). 
1. pra+kr+Ktvá = pra+kr+LyaP (7.1.37) and LyaP is therefore treated as a kft affix like Ktvá and by 6.1.71 [hrasvasya PITi krti tuK) is treated as though it were also marked by K as IT, conditioning thereby a final increment tuK: pra-kft-ya- 'having started to do or perform'. 
21 
2. 7.1.84 [diva auT] provides a substitute auT for the final phoneme of nominal stem div- 'heaven, sky' before the SUP triplet sU (nom. sing.):dfv+sU = di- au+sUdyau+8 (6.1.77), but affix s is not replaced by (6.1.68) as applicable to the original stem [dív] ending in a consonant. 
= 
1.1.57 aCaḥ párasmin purva-vidhaú 
A vowel (aCah) [replacement 56] conditioned by the following (párasmin) element is treated like the original (sthanivát 56) vowel with respect to an operation on what precedes it (pūrva-vidhaú). 
1. This is an exception to the exception contained in the preceding rule. 
2. From the phrase patúm ácsste a denominative is generated by introducing the affix NiC (3.1.25) after the nominal stem: patu+NiC and by a varttika on 6.4.155 [TEh] the syllable beginning with the final vowel is replaced by 1 before NiC: pat+NiC; by 7.2.116 [aTa upadhayah] the penultimate a should be replaced by a vṛddhi substitute (a) before an affix with marker N, but in this case 1 replacement prevents that vowel from being considered as penultimate. 3. In the case of a+gam+Ktvá, Ktvá is replaced by LyaP (7.1.37): a+gam+LyaP, and by 6.4.38 the verbal stem gam- has its final nasal replaced by 0: a+gal+LyaP, since the substitute LyaP for Ktvá is treated as Ktvá it is deemed as a kft affix and by 6.1.71 the verbal stem gets an increment tuK since it ends now in short a, Øreplacement of the final nasal does not prevent this operation by 56 above. 
1.1.58 ná 'pada-antá-'dvir-vácana-varé-ya-lopá-'svára- 
sávarna-7anusvará-dirghá-'jaS-10caR-vidhíṣu 
[The replacement 56 of a vowel 57] is not [ná] treated [like the sub- stituend 56] with respect to operations (vidhísu) pertaining to (1) a pada- final, (2) gemination, (3) Ø replacement before affix vará[C 3.2.175], (4) 0 replacement of (preceding) ya, (5) accent of what precedes, (6) homogeneous phonemes, (7) anusvara replacement (of what precedes it), (8) long vowel replacement (of what precedes it), (9) replacement by voiced unaspirated stops (of what precedes it), and (10) replacement by unvoiced unaspirated stops (of what precedes it). 
(1) In the expression táni sánti 'they exist', sánti derives its surface form from the underlying structure as+0+jhi = *as-anti (7.1.3) where the stem initial is replaced by (6.4.111): táni+08-anti; Ø is not treated like a and consequently no euphonic combination (sám- hita) takes place (6.1.77), as might be expected from the preceding rule. 
(2) In the expression dádhi+átra i of dádhi is replaced by y (6.1.77): dádhy+átra; by 8.4.47 [an-aCi ca] a consonant other than h is optionally geminated after a 
22 
vowel and before a non-vowel; but since the substitute y is not treated like the substituend vowel, the option will not prevail. 
(3) In the expression ya+yáN+varáC 
ya-ya+yaN+varáC (6.1.9) a of yaN is replaced by before affix varáC (6.4.48): ya-ya+y+vará, and the Ø-replacement is not treated like the substituend with respect to replacement of y before vará- (6.1.66): yaya+0+vará- yaya-vará- 'constantly moving'. 
(4) From the denominative kanduyá- 'scratch' with affix KtiN we get: kanduya+ti: kándüy+ti (6.4.48) kánḍu00+ti (6.1.66) since -replacement of a is not treated like the substituend. 
= 
(5) kr+saN+NouL ci-kir-sa+Nvul 
= 
= 
cikir-sa-+aka- (7.1.1) cikir-80+aka- (6.4.48) cikfr-s-aka- 'desirous of doing'. Since marker L of NvuL provides for the udátta accent to be placed on the preceding vowel we realize the correct form cikfr-s-aka despite the intervention of the substituend which is not treated like the original substituend. 
= 
(6) From the verbal stem pis- (VII 15) 'crush, pound' we derive the Imperative 2nd pers. sing, as follows: pis+ŚnáM+hi (3.1.78; 4.87) = pi-ná-s+hi pi-no-s (6.4.111) +dhi (6.4.101) pi-n-s+dhi pi-m-s+dhi (8.3.24) pi-m-s+dhi (8.4.42) pi-m-d-dhi (8.4.53) pi-n-d-dhi (8.4.58) pi-n-dhi (8.4.65) where Ø-replacement of a of na is not treated like the substituendum. 
=

= 
= 
= 
(7) In the step pi-no+s+dhi pi-m-8+dhi above, is not treated like the sub- stituend when replacing the non-pada-final dental nasal by the anusvara (8.3.24). (8) The Instrumental sing. of prati-dívan- 'gambling opponent' is generated as fol- lows: prati-divan+Ta prati-díven+a (6.4.134) prati-dívn-a (8.2.77) since in the verbal stem div-, i is the penultimate and a is not treated like the sub- stituend a before n. 
= 
= 
(9) The Imperative third pers. dual of bhas- 'chew' (111 18) is derived as follows: bhas+tám (3.4.90) bhas+Ślu+tám (2.4.75) ba-bhas-tám (6.1.10; 7.4.59; 
= 
= 
8.4.54) = ba-bhs +tấm (6.4.100) = ba-bh00+tám (8.2.26) = babh-dhám (8.2.40) = bab-dhám (8.4.53) where 0-replacement is not treated like its substituend. (10) The third per. plur. Perfect of ghas- 'eat' (1 747) is generated as follows: ghas+IT ghas+ús (3.4.82) = ja-ghas+ús (6.1.8; 7.4.62; 8.4.54) = ja-gh0s+ús (6.4.98), jaghs-ús (8.3.60) jaks-ús (8.4.55) where 0-replacement is not treated. like the substituend. 
= 
1.1.59 dvir-vácane-aCi 
Before (an affix with) an initial vowel (aCi) (which conditions a reduplication of the verbal stem) [the replacement 56] of a vowel is treated like the original substituend (sthanivát 56) only with respect to that reduplication (dvir-vácane). 
This rule has a five-fold application with respect to (1) replacement of a, (2) Ø replacement of the penultimate, (3) 0 replacement of NiC, (4) replacement of semi-vowels and (5) replacement by ay, av, ay, av. 
(1) Perfect 3rd pers. dual of verbal stem pa- 'drink' (1 972) is derived as follows: 
23 
pa+átus (3.4.82) p0+átus (6.4.64) and by 6.1.8 the verbal stem undergoes reduplication before IIT substitutes, but this rule applies to stems containing a single vowel, and here we have only a single consonant p; but since is treated like the substituend a the form generated is pa-p0-átus pa-p-átus 'they two have drunk'. 
= 
(2) Perfect 3rd dual of han 'kill' is similarly derived, for the reasons already stated under (1) as follows: han+átus - hon+atus (6.4.98) ha-hon+átus ja-hon+átus (7.4.62) ja-ghn-átus (7.3.55). 
= 
= 
= 
(3) Aorist 3rd pers. sing. of the causative stem of at- 'wander' is derived thus: at+NiC+Cli (3.1.44) at+NIC+CáŃ (3.1.48) at+NiC+CaN (7.2.116) at+i+CaN ati-ti+a+t (3.4.100; 6.1.2,11) a-ti-ta-t (6.4.51) where is treated like the substituend NiC in deriving the reduplicated theme [a-ti-t] by 
6.1.2. 
= 
= 
(4) Perfect 3rd pers. of kr- 'to make, perform': kr+átus kr-átus kr-kr-átus (6.1.8) cr-kr-átus (7.4.62) ca-kr-átus (7.4.66) where the semi-vowel replace- ment of the sonant vowel (6.1.77) is treated like the substituend. 
= 
= 
= 
= 
(5) Perfect 1st pers. sing. of ni- 'to lead': ni+NaL (3.4.82) nái+a (7.2.115) 
nay+a (6.1.78)= ni-náy-a (6.1.8) ni-náy-a (7.4.59) where the ay replacement is treated like the substituend for the purpose of reduplication. 
1.1.60 á-darśanam lópaḥ 
= 
(The t.t.) lopa (=) denotes the disappearance, invisibility, elision (a-darśanam) [= zero replacement] (of an item). 
As a t.t. occurs in 1.1.4,58; 3.9; 3.1.11-2; 4.32, 97-8; 4.1.133; 3.22,133; 5.1.125; 3.82; 
4.1,51,138, 146ff. 
"Disappearance" implies prior appearance of some unit and thus construed gives the 
notion of zero (0) replacement. 
1.1.61 pratyayásya luK-2Ślu-luPaḥ 
(The t.tt.) luk (01), ślu (02) and luP (03) denote (elision or disappearance (adarśana 60) = zero replacement] of an affix (pratyaya). 
As a t.t. luk occurs in 1.2.49; 2.4.58; 4.1.88,90,109,175-78. Ślu occurs in 2.4.75; 
6.1.10; 7.4.75. luP occurs in 1.2.51; 4.2.4ff.,81; 3.166-68; 5.2.105. 
1.1.62 pratyaya-lopé pratyaya-lakṣaṇám 
When an affix is replaced (pratyaya-lopé) [by 0] operations conditioned by it still operate (pratyaya-kalṣaṇám) (as if the affix were still present). 
1. The repetition of the word pratyayá- in this rule, when it was already recurring from the preceding one is for the purpose of emphasizing the fact that only when the whole affix is replaced by zero the operation conditioned by it takes place.

2. The present participle of gam- 'go' [I 1031] : gam+Sát] (3.2.124) 
gám+SaP+ŚatR (3.1.68) = gách+a-ath (7.3.77) = gácch-a-ath (6.1.73); before strong affixes (sUT of SUP triplets) the infixed increment nuM is inserted after its last vowel: gácch-a-at+sU gácch-a-t+sU (6.1.97) gácch-a-n-t+sU (7.1.70); since this affix occurs as the final member of a conjunct as pada- final (1.4.14) it is replaced by (8.2.23) leaving a pada ending in -t: gácch-a-n-t and by recurring application of 8.2.23 conjunct pada-final t is now replaced by 0: gácch-a-n; replacement of the affix still conditions the padá status of gácch-a-n. Similarly in the nom. plur. form of saptán+Jas saptan +01 saptán+01 (7.1.22); the status of being a padá (1.4.14) of saptán+Jas still holds good for saptán+0= saptá00 (8.2.7)= saptá '7'. 
= 
= 
3. Optative 1st pers. sing. of a+han- is derived as follows: á+han+siyuT (3.4.102) +iT (3.4.78) á-han+styT+aT (3.4.106) á-han+y-a (7.2.79) = 6-høn (6.4.98)+0Ty+a á-ghn-iy-a (7.3.54); since only a part of the initial increment siyuȚ is replaced by 0, the replacement of the dental nasal of the verbal stem conditioned by 6.4.37 does not take place. 
= 
1.1.63 ná lumata=ángasya 
[When a zero replacement of an affix is conditioned by the use of 62] (the t.t.) lu (= luk, Ślu or luP 61) [operations pertaining to 62] a pre- affixal stem (ángasya [1.4.13]) do not take place. 
= 
A gotra descendant of garga- is garga+yaN (4.1.105) gárg-ya- (6.4.48; 7.2.117); the nominative plural of this in deep structure is: garga+yaN+Jas; 2.4.64 con- ditions the replacement of affix yaN by luK: garga+01+Jas; since this is a re- placement by a t.t. containing lu(K) the operation conditioned by yaN (replacing the first syllabic of the nominal stem by víddhi 7.2.117) does not take place: gargah (8.2.15). 
1.1.64 aCaḥ-ántya=ādi TI 
(The t.t.) TI denotes that part of an element which begins with the last vowel. 
In other words this t.t. denotes the syllable which begins with the last vowel of a given unit. As a t.t. occurs in 3.4.79; 5.3.71; 6.3.92; 4.143-45,155; 7.1.88; 8.2.82-84,89-90. 
From the verbal stem edhA vṛddhau (I 2) 'increase, grow' we arrive at the 3rd pers. sing. Present Indicative (LAT) as follows: edhHAT = édh+SaP+ta = édh-a+te (3.4.79) which conditions the replacement of TI by e; in this case a of ta fulfills the definition, but in the dual form: édh-a+atam am is the TI which is so 
replaced: édh-a+ate édh-a+iyte (7.2.81) édh-e-te (6.1.66,87). 
= 
= 
25 
1.1.65 aLaḥ-ántyat púrva upadhá 
(The t.t.) upadhá 'penultimate' denotes the phoneme (aL) preceding (púrva) the last one (ántya) (of an expression). 
1. As a t.t. occurs in 6.3.47; 4.7,20,24,47,89,149; 7.1.101; 2.116; 4.1-8; 8.2.9,76-79. 2. 3rd pers. sing. IAT of vídá jñáne (II 55) 'know': víd+0+tip (2.4.72) = véd+tiP (7.3.86) where the light penultimate (laghú-upandha) of víd- is replaced by guná. 
1.1.66 tásmin=iti nírdiste púrvasya 
A form stated in the locative case (ending in the seventh SUP triplet) denotes an element the unit preceding which (púrvasya) is subject to the grammatical operation introduced by that statement. 
1. This is a metalinguistic rule (páribhasa) and denotes the right context before 
which the operation takes place. 
2. While by metarules the three cases: ablative, genitive and locative have the specified technical application in the formulation of the sutras, other normal uses also occur when these do not denote a phonological context. Several types of the locative case are noted by the Paninfyas: (a) locative of domain (visaya-saptami) : (chándasi 1.2.62; 4.81 etc.; bhāṣayam 3.2.108 etc.) (b) locative of cause (nimitta-saptami) which serves as a condition for an operation but need not oc- cur directly after the unit operated on (= operand) as in the case of 1.1.5 as ap- plied to the 3rd pers. plur. of the Present Indicative of víd-: vid+01+jhi vid-ánti (7.1.3) where ánti is deemed to be marked with N as IT (1.2.4) but the operand i is separated from it. In contrast to this the locative indicated in the present rule is designated para-saptamf 'an immediately following context'. (c) locative of being or locative absolute (sati saptamf or *sat-saptamf) such as [árdhadhatuke 6.4.46ff.] (d) a locative is also used to denote meanings: [radho himsayam 6.4.123]. (e) lastly it is also used to denote the subordinate member of a compound (úpapada) 3.1.92. 
1.1.67 tásmad ity úttarasya 
= 
A form stated in the ablative case (tásmat) denotes an element, the unit following (párasya) which (is subject to the grammatical operation intro- duced by the rule). 
1. This indicates the left context after which the operation indicated obtains. 2. In affix-governing rules ablatives such as (prátipadikat 4.1.1) or (dhátoḥ 3.1.91] are not interpreted by this context. However, there are instances where the geni- tive is used when the ablative is expected and Paniniyas usually interpret this as [pañcamy-arthé sasthi 'the sixth sUP triplets used for the fifth'. The reason for such divergence in most cases appears for the sake of brevity. 
261.1.68 svám rūpám sábdasya-á-sabda-saṁjñā 
An expression denotes itself (svám rūpám) unless it is the name of a lin- guistic technical term (sabda-samjñā). 
Thus the rule [agnér dháK 4.2.33] applies only to the expression agní- and not to its synonyms like pávaka-, váhni-, jválana- etc. [svám rūpám] its own form' is, however, in a few cases overlooked, where the expressions indicate general classes like the technical terms themselves or common nouns like the expressions 2.4.11 víksá- 'tree', mrgá- 'deer', tfna- 'grass', or svá- (3.4.40) which includes all types of wealth or property and paksín- 'bird', mrgá- 'deer', mátsya- 'fish' denoting genus or species which include all individual specimens. 
1.1.69 aNo2 uT-it sávarnasya ca-á-pratyayaḥ 
(A phoneme) denoted by the siglum aN2 (= a, i, u, F, J, e, o, ai, au, h, y, v, r, 1) or one having the marker U as IT denotes (not only itself [svám rupam 68] but also) all phonemes homogeneous with it (sávarnasya), un- less it is an affix (pratyayah). 
In the expression [at-gunah (aCi 6.1.77 ékah purva-paráyoh 6.1.84) 6.1.87] the abla- tive [at] of phoneme [a] stands for all sub-members or allophones of the a-class [3 lengths, 3 accents and ±nasality]; similarly in the rule [cOh kUh (padásya 8.1.6) 8.2.30 cU represents all palatal stops and kU all velar stops. 
1.1.70 Ta-paras tát-kalasya 
A (vowel) phoneme followed or preceded by marker T denotes homogeneous phonemes of its time duration (tát-kalasya). 
Patanjali interprets the expression [ta-para-h] as Tah páro yásmat = Táparaḥ / tād api párah Ta-paráh. [Ta-para] thus lends itself to be interpreted as 'followed by or following T'. Thus in (aT-eN gunáh 1.1.2) T follows [a] but precedes eN (= e,o). Consequently [a] stands for the a-class of one mora duration while [e,o] represent homogeous phonemes of two mora duration. This is important, for the single replacement of [a+1] would still be [e], the two coalescing vowels being of two mora duration each, but their replacement by this rule is, not of four mora duration, but only two. In 3.2.171 [at-r-gama-hanÁ-jánah 1Kí-2Kinau IIT ca], in the expression [ad-r-] the phoneme d is not a replacement of this T as might. be thought of at first sight, but either the phoneme d or t used for ease of pronunciation, since verbal stems ending in the phoneme class [r] are subject to the operation stated in that rule. 
27 
1.1.71 adír ántyena sahá-ITā 
The initial item which is to be denoted (adíḥ), together with (sahá) the final (ántyena) IT marker (ITA) of the last item (ántya) to be denoted (constitutes a siglum) [denoting itself 68] (and the intervening items). 
1. The notion of the intervening items arises from the definition of the words [adi] 
'that which has no prior item' and [ántya] 'that which has no succeeding item'. 2. Through the operation of this rule P. employs 41 sigla (pratyähärá) [or 42 accord- ing to the Paniniyas who include rÃ as one based on the SS]. The 21 basic nominal endings (4.1.2) are represented by the siglum sUP, the first five of them, constituting the strong case endings by SUT; similarly the basic personal endings of the verbal system (3.4.78) by the siglum tiN and the special nine belonging to the middle voice (atmanepadá) by taŃ. 
1.1.72 yéna vidhís tad-antásya 
When an operation (vidhí) is stated by means of a unit X (= a phoneme or group of phonemes) which is part of a larger unit which it qualifies, that X denotes the element ending in it (tad-antásya) [as well as itself (svásya rūpásya) 68]. 
By the rule [er aC 3.3.56] affix aC is introduced after all verbal stems ending in["-i] 
as well as the verbal stems iK-, iN-, IN. 
1.1.73 výd-dhi-r yásya-aCam adís tád vrd-dhám 
(The t.t.) vrd-dhá denotes (all such) expressions whose first vowel (aCam adíh) is a member comprised by (the t.t.) vf-dhi (1.1.1 = a, ai, au). 
1. As a t.t. occurs in 4.1.113,148,157,160,171; 2.114-18, 120-25,141-2; 3.144; 6.2.87 2. By 4.2.114 [vrd-dhát-chah] a secondary nominal stem derived from vrddhá ex- pressions by introducing the affix cha generates forms as follows: sála+cha- = sala+fya- (7.1.2)= salo+iya- (6.4.64)= sal-fya- 'belonging to the hall'. 
1.1.74 tyád-ādīni ca 
[(The t.t.) vrd-dhá] also (ca) denotes the class of (pronominals) whose first member is tyád- 'that'. 
28 
1. Members of this sub-class of sarvanāmáns (pronominals) are: tyád-, tád- 'that', etád- 'this, adás 'that', idám- 'this', eka- 'one', duí- 'two', yusmád- 'you', asmád- 'we', bhávatU 'your honor', kim- 'which, what, who'. 
2. Affix cha is introduced after these members although they do not meet the con- ditions of 73 above: tyad-iya-, tad-íya-, tvad-ya-, mad-iya-, yusmad-fya-, asmad-fya-, bhavad-fya- etc. 
1.1.75 eN pracám desé 
[(The t.t.) vrd-dhá 73] denotes (all such) expressions [whose first vowel 73] is a member comprised by the siglum eN (= e,o) when they signify a place of habitation (desé) of easterners (pracám).

1.2.1 gaN-kuṭādibhyah-á-N-N-IT-N-IT 
[Afixes] which are not marked with N or N as IT function like those marked with N as IT when introduced after the verbal stems: gaN re- placement of the verbal stem iN (2.4.49-50) 'study', and the group of verbal stems whose first member is kut- 'be curved' (= Dhp. VI 73-108). 
1. There are two verbal stems gaŃ, one a replacement for the verbal stem [IN adhyayane 11 37] and the other gaN gátau (1 998), but the present rule covers only the former. The Aorist marker siC (3.1.44), not being marked with N or N as IT functions as though it were marked with N; thus the 3rd pers. sing. of this verbal stem has the deep structure: adhi+a+ga+siC+ta; by 6.4.66 the stem- final vowel is replaced by I before the Aorist marker since it is functioning like a NIT adhi-á-gi-8+ta adhy-d-gl-s-ta (8.3.59; 4.41).

1.2.5 a-samyogat=IIT K-IT 
Substitute endings of IIT (the Perfect Tense 3.4.81-82) [not marked with P as IT 4] function like those marked with K as IT (when they are intro- duced after a verbal stem) which does not end (1.1.72) in a conjunct con- sonant (a-samyogát). 
1. Before K-IT- affixes guná replacements are blocked (1.1.5) and samprasárana (= vocalization) replacement in certain verbal stems is conditioned (6.1.15 ff) and 0-replacement of penultimate nasals of certain verbal stems takes place (6.4.24). While blocking of guná and vocalization replacements are common to affixes marked with N as IT also, 6.1.15 is restricted to those with K as IT only.

But affix [thaL] replacement of [siP 3.4.82] is a P-iT by metarule 1.1.56 and hence not a K-IT by this rule: kf+thal - kr-kf+thaL (6.1.8) = ca-kf+thaL (7.4.62,66) ca-kár-tha (7.3.84); verbal stems ending in a consonant. cluster: dhvans-+ées (3.4.81) da-dhvans+é (7.4.60; 8.4.54); [és] is not K-IT by this rule because the stem ends in a consonant cluster, blocking out the operation of 6.4.24 which conditions -replacement of the penultimate nasal. Normally since 1-substitutes of IIT constitute the ardhadhätuka class of affixes 4 above does not apply to them, but by the present rule they are deemed to be K-IT when introduced after verbal stems not ending in a conjunct. 
1.2.6 'índhi-2bhavatibhyam ca 
[Substitute endings of IIT 5] introduced after the verbal stems índh- 'kindle' (VI 11) and bhu- 'become' (I 1) also (ca) function [like those with marker K as IT 5]. 
1. The verbal stem indh- is included here because it is an exception to 5 above, having a consonant nexus at the end; bhú- is included so as to extend the domain of 5 to include even those affixes which are marked by P as IT. 2. indh+es (3.4.81) i0dh+eś (6.4.24)

4. This rule has been contradicted by Katyayaná and Patanjali for the following. reasons: in the case of [índh-], in the spoken language it comes under the opera- tion of 3.1.36, while in Vedic by 3.4.117 1-substitutes of IT are optionally sarvadhatuka, in consequence of which by 4 above all taN substitutes are N-IT, which results in the form I-dhe, while in the case of [bhú-] a final increment 
31 
(vuk) is introduced by 6.4.88 before 1-substitutes of IUN and IIT which makes the present rule unnecessary. 
1.2.7 'mrdá-2mrdá-3gudhÁ-'kusÁ-klisA-vadÁ-'vasaḥ Krvá 
The affix Ktvá (1.1.40) [in spite of being augmented with initial incre- ment iT (18 below) functions like a K-IT] when introduced after the verbal stems mrd- 'be gracious' (VI 38, LX 44), mrd- 'crush' (IX 43), gudh- 'be angry' (IV 13, IX 45), kuş- 'tear out' (IX 46), klis- 'torment' (IX 50), vad- 'say, utter' (I 1058), and vas- 'dwell' (I 1054). 
1. This is a prior exception to 18 below where it is stated that Ktvá with initial 
increment it does not function like a K-IT. 
2. Because iT-Ktvá functions like a K-IT with respect to the verbal stems listed here we get the following surface forms: mrd-itvá, mrd-itvá, gudh-itvá kus-itvá, klis-itvá, ud-itvá, us-itvá. 
1.2.8 1rúda-'vídá-3músÁ-gráhi-svapi-'pracchaḥ saN=ca

3. Optional application taught in 26 below is blocked by this rule as a prior excep- 
tion in the case of the verbal stems (rúd-, vid-, mús-]. 
1.2.9 iKo jhaL 
[The affix saN 8] (with initial 1.1.54) non-nasal stops and fricatives (jhaL) introduced after a verbal stem (ending in 1.1.72) in a vowel com- prised by the siglum iK (= i, u, r, 1) [functions like a K-IT affix 5]. 
From the verbal stem ci- 'gather', we get the underlying deep structure of the desiderative base as ci+saN (3.1.7) and since guná replacement of the stem vowel (7.3.84) is blocked out by the present rule, 6.4.16 [aC-hanÁ-gamam saNi] conditions its replacement by the corresponding long vowel: ci+saN = cf-ci-saN (6.1.9) cí-ci+saN (7.4.59)= cí-ci-sa- (8.3.59); similarly from su- 'press,

The siglum jhal in the sutra is really in the place of an-iT qualifying saN, for only the phoneme s of jhal is involved and saves one mora by over-inclusion of phonemes.

1. The Precative or Benedictive (asir-IIN) 3rd pers. sing. Atm. of [bhid-] 'split' (VII 2) is derived as follows: bhidHIN bhid+tá (3.4.78) bhid+siyuT+ suT+ta (3.4.102, 107) = bhid+s-s-tá (6.1.66) bhid-si-s-tá (8.3.59; 4.41) bhit-si-s-tá (8.4.55). The short penultimate vowel of the verbal stem is not replaced by guná since marker K blocks out this operation of 7.3.86 by metarule 1.1.5.

2. Similarly the Aorist (IUN) 3rd pers. sing. is derived as follows: bhid+IUN = bhid+tá (3.4.78) = bhid+Cli+tá (3.1.43) bhid+siC+tá (3.1.44) bhid +0+tá (8.2.26) bhit-ta (8.4.55) aT+bhit-ta (6.4.71) á-bhit-ta.

2. Similarly: sam+gam +UN

The (IUN substitute marker) siC introduced after the verbal stem han- 'kill' (II 2) [functions like a K-IT affix 5 before atmanepadá endings 11]. 
This verbal stem regularly takes Parasmaipadá endings and is replaced by [vadhá-] before IIN and IUN (2.4.42-3); when co-occurring with preverb á- it regularly takes Atmanepadá endings and before these introduced after IIN and IUN [han-] is optionally replaced by [vadhá-] (2.4.44). When it has its own form we have: á+han+siC+ta á+ha+e+ta (6.4.37) á-ha-0-ta (8.2.27)= a+at+ha-ta = á-ha-ta 'has killed' or 'has been killed' (passive).

[The IUN substitute marker siC 14] introduced after the verbal stem yam- (I 1033) when it expresses the sense of 'divulge, disclose' (gándhane) [functions like a K-IT affix 5 before Atmanepadá endings 11]. Like (han-) above [yam-] takes Atmanepadá endings when co-occurring with preverb [áŃ-] (1.3.28); thus: á+yam+siC+ta á-ya-s-ta (6.4.37) á-ya-0-ta (8.2.27), á-ya-s-atam, á-ya-s-ata; but in other senses: á-yam-8-ta

1. One should note that in the sutras 1,2,5,6,10 the ablative case is used while in 2,3,7,8,9,11-15 it is presumed to be an ablative, although the surface form is identical with the genitive; in the present case the genitive-locative common form [stha-ghv-os] occurs, and the context indicates that it is the substituend for the replacement element [iT] which determines its status as a genitive dual. Context in these cases determines the character of the forms used. With reference to the relative position of siC and (stha+GHUclass stems) one has to assume the trans- formation of the genitive dual to that of the ablative dual (*stha-GHU-bhyam), a process which Patanjali defines by the verbal stem (pra-k]p-). It will be shown at the appropriate places where Paniniyas indicate the use of the genitive for the ablative in the sense of 1.1.67 by the statement (pañcamy-arthé ṣasthí). 
2. [stha-] takes Atm. endings under conditions of co-occurrence with certain preverbs.

Vowel length is determined by the duration of its actual enunciation; three lengths are commonly recognized by these three technical terms, the short (hrasvá) measuring one mora, the long (dirghá) measuring two and the prolated (plutá) measuring three. By the same pattern of duration a consonant is es- timated to last half a mora or metrical unit whose actual value is relative to the speed of normal speech of each person. 
2. The t.t. hrasvá occurs in 1.2.32,47; 4.6,10; 6.1.69,71,127,151,176; 3.43,61; 4.92,94; 
7.1.54; 3.80,107-8,113; 4.52. 
3. The t.t. dirghá occurs in 1.1.58; 4.12; 3.1.6; 6.1.7,68,75-6,101-2; 4.25-6,69,83,94; 
8.2.46,76-7; 3.9; 4.52. 
4. The t.t. plutá occurs in 6.1.125; 8.2.82-108. 
1.2.28 aCaś ca 
[(Substitutes introduced by using the t.tt.) hrasvá-, dirghá- or plutá 27] replace vowels (aCah) only. 
This is a meta-rule, and the expression (aCah in the genitive] as the substituend is expected to occur wherever it is not specified but any of these t.tt. is used in the formulation of the rules, as in 47 below [hrasvó nápumsake pratipadikásya] 
38 
where the word [pratipadikásya] is interpreted as [prätipadikásya (ántyasya 1.1.52) aCah (stháne 1.1.49)], just as (iKah 1.1.3] is supposed to recur when the words guná and viddhi are employed without actually specifying the sub- stituend. 
1.2.29 uccaír udáttaḥ 
(The t.t.) udátta 'high-pitched' denotes [a vowel 27] with rising tone (uccaíh). 
As a t.t. occurs in 1.2.32,37,40; 3.96; 4.103; 4.1.37,52; 4.108; 5.2.44; 6.1.159-223; 
2.64-126; 4.71; 7.1.98; 8.2.5,82-108; 4.66. 
1.2.30 nīcaír ánudattaḥ 
(The t.t.) ánudatta 'low-pitched' denotes [a vowel 27] with falling tone (nīcaíh). 
As a t.t. occurs in 1.2.38-9; 2.4,32,33; 3.1.4; 4.1.38; 6.1.59,120,161,190; 8.2.6. 
1.2.31 samāhāráḥ svaritáḥ 
(The t.t.) svaritá- 'circumflex' denotes [a vowel 27] having a combination (samahará) [of rising (uccaíh 29) and falling (nicaíh 30) tones]. 
1. As a t.t. occurs in 1.2.37,39; 3.11; 6.1.185; 8.2.4,6,103; 4.66-7. 
2. The musical nature of these tones is referred to in Paniniya-Sikṣā (v.18) by at- 
tributing specific notes in the fundamental scale (of music) as under: 
(a) udátta 
(b) ánudatta 
(c) svaritá 
seventh/third 
second/sixth first/fourth/fifth 
1.2.32 tásya-adíta udáttam ardha-hrasvám 
Of that (tásya) [svaritá 31] the duration of half a mora (ardhahrasvá) vowel (aC) 28 from the beginning (adítaḥ) is udatta 'high-pitched'. 
Thus, in a short svaritá vowel the first half is udátta and the second half is ánudatta; in a long svaritá vowel, other than the first half, the remaining one and a half will be ánudatta, and in a plutá svaritá the remaining two and a half mora will be ánudatta. 
39 
1.2.33 éka-śruti durát sambúddhau 
When calling some one from a distance (durát sambuddhau) (the ut- terance is articulated as) a mono-tone (éka-śruti). 
The three tones defined by 29-31 are merged into a single tone without distinction. 
1.2.34 yajña-karmáni-á-'japa-2nyünkha-3sāmasu 
In a sacrificial act (yajña-karmáni) the enunciation [is in monotone 33] except in (1) silent repetition (jápa) (of a sacrificial formula), (2) nyünkhá 'insertion of [O] and [3] sáman 'melody'. 
1. Mántras used in the performance of a sacrifice are to be in monotone. 
2. The exceptions are with reference to the soft murmuring of mántras with accents intact and the insertion of sixteen varieties of the phoneme [o] and the melodic recitation of the Sama-Veda. 
1.2.35 uccaistarám va vaṣatkāráḥ 
[In a sacrificial act 34] the expression vásat optionally occurs (va) [in a monotone 34] or with a markedly higher pitch (uccaistarám). 
1.2.36 vibhāṣā chándasi 
(In the recitation of) the Veda (chándasi) [the monotone 34] is optional (vibhāṣā). 
1. The use of the word vibhāṣā here, in the face of the recurring optional indicator va of 35 is for the purpose of blocking out the recurrence of [yajña-karmáni 34]. Thus it is implied that in the self-study or recitation of the Veda monotone can take place optionally. 
2. When monotone is not employed the alternate recitation will be in the three tones 
or pitches. 
1.2.37 ná subrahmanyayam svaritásya tu=udattaḥ 
In the recitation of Subrahmanyà hymns [monotone 34] does not (ná) oc- cur, but the udátta accent replaces the svaritá. 
In the recitation: subrahmanyóm índrá ágáccha, since subrahmanya- is derived from su-brahman- with affix yaT. 'yà bears the svarita accent (6.1.85); similarly indra, heing a vocative, has the udátta accent on the initial syllable, and the following [a] of the second syllable, following an udátta has the svaritá 
40 
accent (8.4.66); similarly in á-gaccha, á- has the udátta accent (6.2.49) while the following ánudatta is replaced by svaritá; all these svaritás will be replaced. by the udátta accent. 
1.2.38 'deva-'brahmanor ánudáttaḥ 
[In the recitation of the Subrahmanyà hymns 37] the ánudatta accent replaces [the svaritá accent 37] of the expressions deva brāhmaṇaḥ [occurring therein]. 
Since devah, brahmanah are vocatives they bear the udátta accent on their initial syllable and the ánudatta vowel in the following syllable is replaced by svaritá (8.4.66); by this rule 37 is blocked, through a process of replacing the svaritá by the original ánudatta accent. 
1.2.39 svaritát sámhitayam ánudattānām 
In continuous recitation (sámhitayam 'maximum contiguity') [monotone 33] replaces the ánudatta vowels following a svaritá. 
In continuous recitation of imám me gange yamune sarasvati since the ánudatta vowel in me follows the udátta of mám of imám it is replaced by svaritá, and since by 8.1.19 all vocatives not standing at the head of a phrase are ánudatta, it is replaced by monotone in all the succeeding vowels of that recitation. 
1.2.40 udatta-svaritá-parasya sannátaraḥ 
A tone or pitch called sannátara 'lower (than nīcaíḥ 'low' 30)' replaces [an ánudatta 38] followed by an udátta or svaritá (udatta-svaritá-para). 
In the formula deva marutaḥ préni-mataro páḥ, matarah is all anudatta (8.1.19) while apah has the udátta accent on the second syllable (6.1.171), so the samdhi vowel [o] in mataró páḥ bears the sannátara accent. 
1.2.41 áprkta éka-al pratyayáḥ 
(The t.t.) áprkta denotes an affix consisting of a single phoneme (ék=aL), 
As a t.t. occurs in 6.1.67-8; 7.3.91,96ff. 
41 
1.2.42 tatpuruṣaḥ samaná-adhikaraṇaḥ karmadhārayáḥ 
(The t.t.) karmadharayá denotes a tatpurusá compound (2.1.22-2.21) formed from coordinate padás (samaná-adhikarana 'having the same case endings'). 
1. nflam utpalám nila+utpalám (2.4.71)= nilotpalám 'blue lotus". 
2. As a t.t. occurs in 2.2.38; 6.2.25-28,46,57; 3.42. 
1.2.43 prathamá-nirdiṣṭam samasá upasárjanam 
(The t.t.) upasárjana 'subordinate member' denotes items appearing in the first SUP triplets (nominative case endings) (in the the rules which serve to generate) compounds (samasé [2.1.3-2.38]). 
As a t.t. occurs in 1.2.48,57; 4.1.14,54; 6.2.36,104; 3.82. 
1.2.44 éka-vibhakti ca-á-pūrva-nipate 
[(The t.t.) upasárjana 43] also (ca) denotes [a member of a compound 43] which always has the same case ending (éka-vibhakti) (in the deep struc- ture of the compound) except with respect to being placed in the prior position (á-purva-nipāte). 
In the compound nís-kausambi- (nískranta+sUP kausambi+Nasl in the underlying deep structure) the word -kausambi- is always followed by the fifth singular SUP triplet where as nískranta- can be followed by different SUP triplets, though the composition is not necessary and can be equally substituted by the declined forms of individual members. 
1.2.45 arthavád á-dhätur á-pratyayaḥ prātipadikám 
(The t.t.) pratipadiká 'nominal stem' denotes a meaningful (arthavát) ex- pression other than a dhátu 'verbal stem' (1.3.1; 3.1.32) or a pratyayá 'affix' (3.1.1-5.4.166). 
As a t.t. occurs in 1.2.47; 2.3.46; 4.71; 4.1.1; 8.2.7; 4.11. 
Since this rule is followed by another rule below, extending the operation of this t.t., here it is restricted to primitive or underived nominal stems. Two views were expressed by grammarians. Šakatayaná and his followers believed that all nominal stems were derivable from verbal stems, while others held the view that this was not always true. P's view appears to posit two sets: (1) underived (á-vyutpanna-) nominal stems or primitive stems and (2) derived nominal stems. As verbal stems are fully registered in the Dhatupatha and all affixes (with the 
42 
exception of Un-adi group] are dealt with in chapters 3-5 of Ast., morphemes. other these will by definition be nominal stems. P's structure of Sanskrit is based on these three fundamental building blocks, a significant departure from the earlier four-fold analysis with náman 'nomen, nominal stem', ákhyāta 'verbal. stem, verbum', upasargá and nipatá without special analysis of pratyayas 'affixes'. 
1.2.46 kft-taddhitá-'samasás ca 
[(The t.t.) pratipadiká- 45] also (ca) denotes (derived nominal stems end- ing in 1.1.72) kft 'primary affixes' (3.1.93ff.), in taddhitá 'secondary affixes' (4.1.76ff.) or those forming samasás 'compounds' (2.1.3ff.).

1.2.47 hrasvó nápumsake pratipadikásya 
A short [vowel 28] replaces (the final 1.1.52) vowel of a nominal stem (pratipadikásya) employed in the neuter gender (nápumsake). 
The compound áti+rai- 'who or which has surpassed wealth', when qualifying a neuter substantive, replaces the final vowel ai by short i (1.1.48): áti-ri- kúlam an extravagant family', but in conjunction with non-neuter substantives we have grama-ni 'village head-personl'; senanf 'army general'. 
1.2.48 1gó-2striyór upasárjanasya 
[A short vowel 47] replaces the final vowel (1.1.52) [of the prätipadiká 45] gó- 'cow (f), bull (m)' occurring as an upasárjana (43) and of an upasárjana (ending in 1.1.72) in a feminine affix (striyám 4.1.3ff.). 
1. The underlying deep structure of citrá gávo yásya sáh 
gávo yásya sáh citrá+TaP+ Jas+go+Jas citra-0+go+8U (6.3.34; 2.4.71) yields the surface form citráguh 'possessed of brindled cows'. 
the underlying structure nis+(krántá-)+sU+kausambi+Nasl (= niskrántáḥ kausambyas) we generate the surface form of the compound nis +0+0+kausambī+sU (2.2.18; 4.71)= nís-kausambi-h (8.3.15). 
43 
1.2.49 luk taddhita-luki 
When a taddhita 'secondary' affix is replaced by luK (-01 1.1.61) luk (01) at the same time replaces [the feminine affix of the upasárjana 48]. 
In the compound generated from páñca indranyó deváta asya with the underlying structure: páñca+Jas + indra+anuK+ NIS+Jas + deváta+Jas the surface form is generated by pañca+1+indra+01+0+8U páncendra-s 'a sacrifical cake sacred to five Indranís'. This surface form is realized through the operation of 4.1.38 [dvigór luK án-apatye] which introduces a luK replacement of affix [áN] in the resulting Dvigú compound: páñca +0+indraní+áN (4.1.83; 2.24) and with replacement of the taddhita affix [áN 4.1.83], also replaces at the same time the feminine affix (anuK+NÍS 4.1.49] of the upasárjana indraní. 
1.2.50 IT-gonyáh 
The short vowel i(T) replaces (the final 1.1.52 vowel) of the nominal stem goní a sack measure' [when the taddhita affix introduced after it is replaced by luk (01) 49]. 
This is an exception to 49 above, and the feminine affix in [gonf] is replaced by the short vowel: páñcabhir gonfbhih kritáḥ páñca+bhis+goni+bhis+kritá+sU = pañca ++goni+thaK (5.1.19,37) = pañca-goni+01 (5.1.28)= panica-gon-itsU 'purchased with five sack measures'. 
1.2.51 lupi yuktavát='vyakti-vacané 
[When a taddhita affix 49 is replaced by] luP [1.1.6103] the gender (vyákti-) and number (vácana-) (of the derived word) conforms to that of the original (yukta-vát) word. 
vangānām janapadó nivasáh 'the country of the Vanga people' = vanga+aN 
(4.1.83; 2.69) vanga +03 (4.2.81) 
= 
hand: lavanéna sámsrstah súpah 
= 
1 
vanga+Jas vargah; but on the other 
lavaná+thak (4.4.22) lavand+thaK (4.4.22)= lavaná+luK 
(4.4.24) lavanah supah, lavaná yavagúh (f.), lavanám sákam (n.) where the original expression is neuter, but with luK replacement takes on all three genders. 
1.2.52 viséṣaṇānāṁ ca-á-jāteḥ 
[The gender and number 51] of qualifying words (viséṣaṇānām) are also (ca) [identical with those expressions generated by IUP replacement 51 of taddhita affixes 48] except when they denote a species (játi). 
vangah-bahv-annah-bahu-ksira-ghrtáh 'the people of Vanga (have) plenty of food, 
44 
plenty of milk and butter', but vangah-janapadáḥ 'the country of V. people'; likewise godau ramaniyau 'Goda (village) is beautiful', but godaú grámah 'the village Goda' since the expression gráma- denotes jati 'species' as a village. 
1.2.53 tád ásisyam samjñā-pramāṇatvát 
That (tad) = gender-number agreement 51] between the qualifying and qualified expressions need not be taught (á-sisyam-) since their basis is convention (samjñā-pramāṇatvá). 
= 
This conventional basis can be illustrated by the words darah, (m.pl.), bharyá (fem.), kalatrám (neut.) all signifying 'wife'; áp+Jas ápah f.pl. 'water'; grhá+Jas grháh m.pl. 'wife', sikáta+Jas sikátah f.pl. 'sand' and varsá+Jas varsáh f.pl. 'the rainy season', all with fixed gender and number through ac- cepted convention. 
= 
= 
1.2.54 lup-yoga-a-prakhyānát 
Replacement by IuP (03) [need not be taught 53] since the relationship in meaning (yóga) betwen the primitive and derived stem cannot be posited (a-prakhyānāt). 
Thus váranah 'n.pr. of a village' cannot be related to the presence of the trees of that name if they do not grow there; such words are purely conventional and do not yield to etymological derivation. Therefore the rule [janapadé luP 4.2.81) cannot be said to be valid in such cases. 
1.2.55 yoga-pramané ca tad-abhavé-á-darśanam syat 
For, if the relationship (of etymological meaning) were basic (yoga-pramané), then, in its absence (tad-abhavé) the derived word. should also disappear (ádarsanam syat). 
Place names like váraṇaḥ, pañcaláh are originally derived from the name of the people residing there, and they continue to be used as proper names even when the original people who gave those names, do not reside there, and thus are cur- rent without relevance to their origins, and should be regarded as purely conven- tional, and not etymologically derived. 
45 
1.2.56 pradhana-pratyaya-artha-vacanám 
árthasya-anya-pramāṇatvát 
[Nor is it necessary to teach 53] (the principles that the sense of a word) is expressed by the predominant member (pradhana) (in a derivative word) and by the affix (pratyayá) (in a derived word), because the sense is dependent on something else (anya-pramaṇatvat) [= convention]. 
Katyayaná and Patanjali discuss the relevance of grammatical analysis to natural language by stating that the ultimate authority is the [loka] 'people', that is, the actual speakers, and the aim of such analysis is to describe that usage as it is current among the sistas or 'educated class'. Such an analysis demostrates that in so far as these two aspects are concerned convention alone is the final au- thority. To the extent possible this convention has been brought under the linguist's analysis and a number of works dealing with gender are in existence. P himself has specified rules such as [striyám KtiN 3.3.94, napumsaké bhavé Ktáh 3.3.114]. 
1.2.57 1kāla='upasarjané ca túlyam 
[Nor is it necessary to teach 53] equally (túlyam) (the meaning of) Tense (kála) or upasárjana 'the subordinate member' (43) [since it is dependent on something else 56]. 
Since usage [prayogá] is the principal authority for grammatical analysis, it can deal only with operations which fall within a system; however, number, gender, tense and the order or sequence of members in a compound are purely conventional and may be subject to change from generation to generation. 
1.2.58 jaty-akhyayam ékasmin bahuvacanám anyatarásyam 
The plural (bahuvacanám) is optionally (anyatarásyam) used in the sense of the singular (ékasmin) when designating a species (jaty-akhyāyām). 
An expression can both be a collective noun or represent a single object. Thus in the sentence "Man is prone to error" the word "man" stands for the whole class of human beings (including women) and we can have an alternate sentence "Men are prone to error". Likewise we can say: sampannó yavah or sampannah-yavah 'fully ripe barley', but if the numeral eka- 'one' is used we have eko yavah. By employing the word [játi] 'species' proper names are ex- cluded. 
461.2.59 asmádo dvayoś ca 
[The plural 58] of the (first personal pronoun), asmád- 'we' is also (58) [optionally used in the sense of the singular 58] as well, as in the dual (dváyoḥ). 
For ahám bráv-I-mi 'I speak', one can equally say vayám brumah 'we speak'; 
similarly it can also replace avám brüváh. 
This corresponds to the royal or editorial "We". 
1.2.60 'phalguni-'prosthapadánam ca nákṣatre 
[The plural 58] of the nominal stems phálguni and prostapadá designat- ing asterisms (nákṣatra) also (ca) [optionally replaces the dual 59]. 
The twin-star asterisms will naturally be associated with the dual endings, but the use of the plural endings is optionally taught in the sense of the dual: púrve phálguny-au / párvaḥ phálgu-nyah; purve prosthapadé/púrvah prosthapadáh; however, in the phrase phálgunyau manavike 'girls born under the asterism of Phalguni', the word phálgunyau does not refer to the asterism directly, but is a qualifying expression for manavike 'two girls or maidens' and is therefore not subject to this operation. 
1.2.61 chándasi púnarvasvor ekavacanám 
In the domain of Chándas (= Veda) the singular (ekavacaná) of the nominal stem púnarvasu- 'n.pr. of an asterism consisting of twin stars' is used [for the dual optionally 58-58]. 
púnarvasur nákṣatram /púnarvasu nákṣatram. 
1.2.62 vísakhayos ca 
[In the domain of Chándas the singular 61] of the nominal stem víśākhā 'n.pr. of a twin-star asterism' is also (ca) used for [the dual optionally 58]. 
viềākhā náksatram / visākhe náksatram. 
1.2.63 1tisya-2punarvasvór nakṣatra-dvaṁdvé bahuvacanásya dvivacanám nítyam 
In a Dvamdva compound formed from names of asterisms (nakṣatra- dvamdvé) of tisyà- 'a single star asterism' and púnarvasu 'a twin-star 
47 
asterism' the dual (dvi-vacanm) necessarily (nityam) replaces the plural (bahuvacanásya). 
Since Tisyà is one and Púnarvasu two stars, their compound is naturally expected to take the plural sUP endings, but by this rule the dual ending replaces the plural: udité tisya-punarvasú drsyete 'the asterisms T and P are seen rising'. 
1.2.64 sárüpāņām ekaseṣá eka-vibhaktáu 
When there is the single occurrence of a single (SUP) ending (eka-vibhaktaú 1.4.104) only one of a series of repeated morpheme stems (sárūpāṇām) remains in use (eka-seṣáh).

1.2.65 vṛddhó yúna tád-lakṣaṇas céd-evá viseṣáh 
If a derivative denoting vṛddhá (= a gotrá descendant 4.1.162) is used along with one denoting a yúvan descendant (4.1.163-65), only the former [remains 64] provided the only difference between the two deriva- tives is that they are descendants of the same ancestor (tád-lakṣaṇas céd-evá). 
The t.t. vrddhá in this sense is nowhere defined by Pánini, but Patanjali provides the following gloss: [pürva-sütré gotrásya vɣddhám iti samjñá kriyáte] 'in the earlier sútra (works) the word vṛddhá denotes (the t.t.) gotrá', while the Käsika quotes such a rule [ápatyam ántarhitam vṛddhám] which is parallel to P 4.1.162 [ápatyam pautrá-prabhṛti gotram].

1.2.67 púman striyá 
When a word in the masculine gender (púman) is conjoined with the same word in the feminine gender (striya) the masculine alone [subsists 64]. 
brahmanás ca braihmaní ca brahmanaú 'a brahmin (man) and a brahmin (woman)'. But in the case of indras ca indraní ca since the form indraní is a feminine form derived from the base form indra- in the context of [pumyogá 4.1.45 'co-habitation with man'] the result is indrendrany-aú.

1.2.73 gramyá-pásu-samghéşu-á-tarunesu strí

1. gáva imah 'these (are) cattle'. 
2. imé rúravah (67) 'these (are) antelopes'. This exception applies only to domes 
ticated animals where the feminine is used instead of the masculine.

1.3.1 bhúvadayo dhátavaḥ 
(The t.t.) dhátu- 'verbal base or stem or root' denotes the class of expres- sions whose first member is bhú- 'become' (I 1). 
In the ancillary text called Dhatu-patha all these items are listed under ten major sections corresponding to nine classes of the Present System (särvadhātuka), the tenth being considered as a derived verbal stem with the formans NIC (3.1.25,32), falling within the ambit of the first or general class; NíC also func- tions as the marker of the causative stem (3.1.26). There are almost 2000 stems registered in the extant Dhatu-patha under these ten groups as under: I bhú-class 1059, II ad-class 72, III hu-class 25, IV div-class 137, V su-class 34, VI tud-class 143, VII rudh-class 25, VIII tan-class 9+1, IX kri-class 61 and cur-class 395 (according to Boehtlingk's edition). The original Dhp. consisted only of the ac- tual lists of verbal stems, and meanings were added later, separating the in- dividual members in the continuous text; original form appears like bbv-edh- and in the revised Dhp. bhú- sattayam, édhA- víddhau etc. Verbal stems in general depict action. 
1.3.2 upadesé=aC-ánunasika IT 
(The t.t.) IT denotes a nasalized (ánunasika- 1.1.8) vowel (aC) (of an ele- ment when it is) first introduced (in the grammatical instruction: upadeśe). 
P. uses the nasalized vowels as IT markers for various purposes: primarily to in- dicate in the Dhp. which verbal stems take the middle voice or Atmanepadá when they are associated with the ánudatta accent (12 below) as in the case of [edhÃ vṛddhau I 2]. Later commentators assert (as in the Käsika) that in the sixth SS (LAN) the vowel [a] is nasalized in order to give the siglum [rA] for liquids [r, 1] in the sutra (ur aN rÃ-parah 1.1.51]. Since most sacred and science. texts were primarily transmitted verbally from teacher to pupil in unbroken suc- cession, this nasalization must have been apparent in the oral transmission. With its loss, the later Paniniyas only theoretically recognized this nasalization. by this rule in the written transmission. The same reasoning holds good for the 
use of accents as markers. 
1.3.3 haL ántyam 
[The t.t. IT 2] denotes a final (ántya) consonanant (haL) [in the element when first introduced in the grammatical instruction (upadesé) 2]. 
To arrive at the meaning of the siglum hal this rule is interpreted in two different 
ways: 
1. [hal-antyam] is taken as a compound derived from the under-lying deep structure [haL+Ni+ántya+am hal+0+antya+am] 'the final (element) in [haL]', giving 
= 
51 
the meaning: "The t.t. IT denotes the final element in the expression [haL]'. With this definition L is such a marker and we get the siglum [haL] by 1.1.71 denoting all consonants beginning with (h) of SS 5 and ending with L of SS 14. This then provides for C of aC as an IT marker and the present rule can be properly re-interpreted as under: 
2. "The t.t. IT (2) denotes a consonant (haL) occurring at the end (ántya) of an 
element when first introduced in the grammatical instruction (upadesé 2)". Thus hal is a cover symbol for all consonants and aC for all vowels. All other sigla 
are then derived with the use of these definitions and 1.1.71. 
1.3.4 ná vibhaktau tU-s-máḥ 
[The t.t. IT 2] does not (ná) denote [final 3] dental stops (tU 1.1.69) and the phonemes [s] and [m] in vibhákti (1.4.104) endings. 
While 3 is specifically a general rule, the exception given here restricts the scope of that general rule: thus in [-at replacement of Nasl 7.1.12] after stems ending in short [-a-] [t] is not an IT marker; similarly in the case of Jas, Nas, am, am [s, m] are not IT-s, as in the case of verbal endings tas, -thas, ātām, athām, dhvam (3.4.78). Since [tU, s, m] are not markers when occurring at the end of a vibhakti affix by this rule, they are not subject to the operation of 9 below [replacement by 0]. 
1.3.5 adír NI-TU-DAV-ah 
[The t.t. IT 2] denotes the syllables NI, TU and DU occurring as initials (adíḥ) [of verbal stems when first introduced in grammatical instruction. (upadeśé) 2]. 
These initial syllables accompany certain verbal stems in the Dhp. list: NI-mid-A snehane I 779 'be unctuous'; TUnád-Í samrddhaú I 67 'thrive', DU-kr-N kárane VIII 16 'do, make, perform'. By 3.2.187 the affix [Ktá] which properly belongs to the past passive participle, however, generates a participle expressing the present tense with verbal stems marked with NI as IT: mid+Ktá- = min-ná- (8.2.42) 'is fat'; similarly after stems marked by TU 3.3.89 introduces kṛt affix athúC: nand+athúC (7.1.58) nand-athú- 'delight'; affix Ktri- is introduced by 3.3.88 after stems marked by DU: kr+Ktri+maP (4.4.20) 'artificial'. 
kr-trí-ma- 
1.3.6 ṣaḥ pratyayásya 
[The t.t. IT 2] denotes [the initial 5] phoneme s of an affix (pratyayásya) [when first introduced in grammatical instruction (upadesé 2)]. 
52 
1. Such affixes are: Sá, SáC, SakaN, SkaN, StaráC, StraN, StháC, SthaN, Sthal, 
Spha, SphaK, SyaN, SyaN, SlaN, SvuN. 
2. In 8.3.79 [iNah sidhvam-IUN-IITam dhah-angát] the affix şi-dhvam has initial s-, but it is not an IT marker, since it is a replacement of an original s of siyuT (3.4.102) and consequently is not subject to the operation of 9 below. 
1.3.7 cU-țŪ 
[The t.t. IT 2] denotes the [initial 5] palatal and retroflex stops (1.1.69 CU, tU) [occurring in the affixes 6 when first introduced in grammatical instruction 2]. 
1. Affixes with initial palatal stops: (a) C: CaN, Canaś, CaP, CIN, CphaN, Cli, Cvi; (b) J: Jas, Jasi; (c-d) by separate rules initial ch- and jh- are replaced by iy- (7.1.2) and a(n)t (7.1.3,5) respectively, blocking out 9 below. In presenting the text of Ast. in roman transliteration, therefore, initial ch- and jh- of affixes are not indicated by capital letters, although by this rule they are IT markers; they rather go with ph- and kh- as indicated in 7.1.2. 
2. Initial retroflex stops: (a) T: Ta, TaK, TaC, Ta, TaP, TenyaN, TyaN, Tyu, TyuL (exception titaC); (b) by a separate rule (7.3.51) initial th- is replaced by ik and is therefore not subject to 9 below; (c) D: Da, DáC, DaT, DaN, DatamáC, DataráC, Dati, Da, DáC, DaP, Du, DupáC, DmatUP, Dya, DyaN, DyaT, Dya, DvaláC, DvuN. (d) By a separate rule (7.1.2) initial dh- is replaced by ey, and is therefore not subject to 9 below. All such exceptions to 9 are not indicated by capital letters like regular IT markers. 
1.3.8 la-sa-3kU-á-taddhite 
[The t.t. IT 2 denotes initial 5] phonemes 1, s and velar stops [occurring in affixes 6] other than those belonging to taddhita 'secondary' (á-taddhite) [when first introduced in grammatical instruction 2]. 
1. Affixes with L as IT marker: LyaP [replacement for Ktvá in verbal composition], 
Lyu, LyuT. 
2. Affixes with Ś as IT marker: Šá, ŠátR, Sádhyai, SadhyaiN, SaP, SanáC, SanaN, ŚayáC, ŚnáM, Śna, Śnú, SyaN, Ślu. Note: Ś has another function as IT in regard to replacements where an item marked with it replaces the whole of the substituend: cf. Si, SI, Se. 
3. Affixes with initial velar stops: (a) K: Ká, KaN, Kádhyai, KadhyaiN, KaP, Kamul, KasuN, KaseN, KanáC, Kí, KiN, KuráC, KeN, Kenya, Ktá, KtávatU, KtíC, Ktin, Ktrí, Ktvá, Knú KyaN, KyáC, Kyás (but not kamyáC cf. 3.1.9), KlukaN, KvaniP, KvaraP, KvásU, Kvi, KviN, KviP, Ksá, Ksé, Ksnú-; (b) KH: KHÁC, KHaL, KHamuÑ, KHaL, KHaŚ, KHisnúC, KHukaÑ KhyuN; (c) *Go curs only in *Gsnú (-Ksnú 3.2.138); (d) GH: GHá, GHAN, GHinuN, GHuráC; (e) N: NI, NIN, NIP, NIS, Nas, NasI, Ni, Ne, NvaniP. 
4. In taddhita affixes these do not function as IT markers: (a) I: láC; (b) s: sá 
53 
(5.2.10), sás (5.4.42), saláC; (c) k: kák, katáC, katyáC, kalpaP, kutaráC, kunaP, krtvá- suC; (d) initial kh replaced by iy (7.1.2); (e) g: gmini; (f) gh: replaced by iy (7.1.2): gha, ghaC, ghaN, ghaS. 
1.3.9 tásya lópaḥ 
Lópa (0) replaces that (tásya) [IT marker 2]. 
replaces the whole 
This has relevance 
1. The word tásya is used instead of IT-ab to indicate that the 
IT substituendum and not the final phoneme only (by 1.1.52). to the initial IT markers NI, TU, DU. 2. The IT markers have several functions: (a) they generate the sigla (pratyāhārá); (b) they do not enter into actual grammatical operations except in introducing morpho-phonemic changes in the elements coming together to form the surface units of speech. The morpho-phonemic features associated with the markers re- late to (i) replacement, (ii) augmentation, (iii) accentuation, (iv) generation of feminine stems both of primary and secondary derivatives. Both initial and final IT markers are subject to zero (0) replacement in actual derivation of surface forms after affecting these morpho-phonemic changes. 
3. Guná and Vfddhi blocked by K, N, G (1.1.5); Vŕddhi of stem-final vowels in- dicated by N, N (7.2.115); and of initial syllable of nominal stems (by 7.2.117) and by K (7.1.118). N, N indicate udátta accent on the initial syllabic of the derived form (6.1.197) while K, C indicate this accent on the final syllable (6.1.164-5); L indicates accent on the final syllable preceding the affix (6.1.193) while R indicates that accent is placed on the pre-penultimate syllable of the sur- face form (6.1.217). 
4. T indicates initial augmentation while K indicates final augmentation of the sub- stituendum while M functions as an infixed augment inserted after the last syl- labic (1.1.46-7). 
5. T and DH indicate a feminine affix NIP after a stem generated with these affixes, while NiS operates after stems generated with affixes with marker S (4.1.41). 
1.3.10 yatha-samkhyám anudesáḥ samánām 
(When two sequences of elements) which have the same number of mem- bers (samánām) are stated in rules (the elements of the subsequent. sequence) are related to the former in a (one-to-one) order (yatha-samkhyam). 
54 
There is a one-to-one correspondence in order of enumeration in the two sets, for instance, of the statement 6.1.77 (iKo yaN aCi] where iK represents the vowels [i, u, r, as the substituenda, and yaN the semi-vowels [y, v, r, 1] as the replace- ments: i:y, u:v, rr and Jl. However, a few instances do occur where this metarule does not operate, and certain devices have been used to indicate this fact which will be discussed at their appropriate places; here interpretation (vyakhyana) gives the correct result when there is a doubt. 
1.3.11 svariténa-adhikaráḥ 
Elements which are to serve as governing rules (adhikará) or section headings valid in the subsequent rules are marked with the svaritá 'circumflex' accent (1.2.31). 
1. There are major and minor section headings as also headings within headings: e.g., (pratyayáh, paras ca, ady-údattas ca 3.1.1-3) cover the whole of chapters. 3-5, but within this major governing system we have sub-sections headed by [dhátoḥ 3.1.93, Ni-aP-pratipadikat 4.1.1 and even within this last striyám 4.1.3]. 2. These governing rules are, in a majority of cases, stated with a specification of their range, with words like [prák: prák-ivät kah 5.3.70] or [á- as in á-Kves tacchila-taddharma-tatsädhukarisu 3.2.137]. 
3. Since the corpus of Ast. is built up of sátras, using maximum brevity possible, the full sense of each rule is to be extracted from recurrence of relevant items from the preceding sutras in addition to those of metarules, and traditional commen- tators have often remarked suggesting that certain recurring expressions are ut- tered with the svaritá accent. Like nasalization mentioned in 2 above this accen- tual system must have continued in the oral transmission and been lost in later times. Interpretation (vyäkhyána) is the main alternate authority for indicating where this accent is employed. Two guiding rules generally referred to in this connection: prtijñáunasikyah paniniyah and pratijñá-svaritaḥ paniniyah. 
1.3.12 anudatta-N-ITa atmanepadám 
Atmanepadá (= taN and ana 1.4.100) 1-substitute endings (3.4.78) are in- troduced ater verbal stems marked by an ánudatta vowel or N as IT. 
1. édhA víddhau I 2 is marked with ánudatta A as an IT and so takes the Atmanepadá or middle endings: *edhA+SaP (3.1.68)+ta =*édh0+a+ta (9 above) édh-a-te (3.4.79) 'grows, increases'.

Atmanepadá 1-substitutes are introduced after verbal stems 12] when bhavá- 'impersonal action' or kárman- 'passive action' is to be expressed. 
The 18 1-substitutes (3.4.77-78) are divided into two sets of nine members each, the first nine designated Parasmaipadá and the next nine by the t.t. Atmanepadá (1.4.99-100). Each of these is again subdivided into three triplets, representing the third, second and first persons respectively, in the order of singular, dual and plural for each triplet (1.4.101-2). These members are introduced under general meaning conditions relating to kárakas (1.4.23ff.) and time references. With ref- erence to transitive verbal stems 1-members are introduced when either kárty- 
55 
'active' or kárman- 'passive' construction is to be expressed, and in the case of intransitive verbal stems either kártṛ- or bhavá- 'action in progress' is to be denoted. Thus active and passive constructions are associated with transitive verbal stems and active and impersonal constructions with intransitive verbal 
stems.

to 62 below. 
1.3.58 ná-ánor jñaḥ

putrám ánu-ji-jña-sa-ti 'wishes to inquire after the son', but dharmam jí-jña-sa-te

[Atmanepadá l-substitutes 12 are not 58] introduced after the verbal stem śru- 'hear, listen' (I 989) co-occurring with the preverbs práti-, áŃ- [and the desiderative marker saN 57]. 
práti-susru-sa-ti/á-suśru-sa-ti

karma- 
pravacaníyas and not preverbs, this rule does not apply (1.4.84-6,92): devadattám práti suéru-sa-te 'desires to serve D." 
1.3.60 sadeḥ Ś-IT-aḥ 
[Atmanepadá l-substitutes are introduced after the verbal stem 12] sad- 'fall, perish, decay' (VI 134) when it co-occurs with an affix with marker Ś (sárvadhatuka 3.4.113). 
= 
By 7.3.78 [sad-] is replaced by [Sty-] before S-IT affixes: sad+sa+te (3.1.77) 
sly-á-te, but before non-S-IT affixes: sad+syá+ti (3.1.33) sat-sya-ti (8.4.55), á-sat-sya-t, sí-sat-sa-ti. 
1.3.61 'mriyater UN-IINos ca

[Atmanepadá l-substitutes are introduced after the verb stem 12] mr(N) 'die' (VI 116) [co-occurring with S-IT affixes 60] and (ca) also with 1- substitutes of Aorist (IUN) and Precative (IIN). 
In this rule IIN represents the Precative or Benedictive mood as it is árdhadhātuka (3.4.116) and therefore not Ś-IT while 1-substitutes of Optative (IIN) are S-rr and covered by the preceding rule. 
By its marker [N] mrN prana-tyagé it functions with the Atm. 1-substitutes, but 
67 
this rule restricts this operation only when the verbal stem co-occurs with S-rr affixes and with the non-S-IT affixes of the Aorist and Precative. 
1. mr+Sá+te mriy-á-te (7.4.28).

1.3.62 purvavát saNaḥ 
= 
[Atmanepadá l-substitutes are introduced after a verbal stem 12] co- occurring with the desiderative marker saN under the same conditions that apply to the primitive stem which precedes it (pūrvavát). 
This is a general rule valid for the whole group of verbal stems, the exceptions having been noted in specific rules; thus as-te 'sits' generates the desiderative form as+iT-saN+SaP+te ás-is-is-a-te (6.1.2; 8.3.59) 'wishes to sit', but from pác-a-ti pí-pak-sa-ti (8.2.30; 3.59) 'desires to cook'..

1.3.63 am-pratyayavát krÑah-anuprayogásya

By interpretation [krN] here is regarded as a siglum representing the verbal stems krÑ-, bhú- and as which serve as auxiliary verbs in generating the Periphrastic Perfect forms, with the principal verbal stem with affix ám and the voice as- sociated with that stem determines the voice of of the Periphrastic Perfect form. Thus from edh-a-te: edh-/ám+kr+lIT edh-ám +cakr-e 'has increased'; but from os-a-ti: os-ám+cakár-a 'has burnt'. 
= 
1.3.64 1pra='upābhyam yujer á-yajña-patreṣu 
[Atmanepadá l-substitutes are introduced after the verbal stem 12] yuj- 'join' (VII 7), co-occurring with the preverbs prá-, úpa- except when co-occurring with (words signifying) sacrificial vessels (yajña-patrá). 
This is a prior exception to 72 below which allows both sets of Parasmaipadá and Atmanepadá l-substitutes under the conditions stated there. Those conditions do not obtain here. prá-yuj+SnáM+te (3.1.78) prá+yu-na-j+te prá-yun@j+te (6.4.111) prá-yunk-te (8.2.30) 'joins'; úpa-yunk-te 'uses'; but yajña-pátrám úpa-yunak-ti 'uses a sarificial vessel'.

[Atmanepadá l-substitutes are introduced after a verbal stem 12] co- occurring with the causative marker Ní ( 1.4.52) provided the direct ob- ject (kárman) of the primitive stem (áNi) has become the agent (kartá) of the (derived) stem with marker Ní and does not signify 'remember with regret' (án-a-dhya-ne). 
Exception to 72 below. 
á-roh-anti hastínam hasti-pakah 'the elephant riders mount the elephant' transforms itself into the passive construction: á-roh-ya-te hastí hasti-pakán. 
1.3.88 'bhī-2smyor hetu-bhayé 
[Atmanepadá l-substitutes are introduced after a verbal stem 12] bhi- 'fear, be afraid' (III 2) and smi- 'smile' (I 996) [co-occurring with causa- tive marker Ní 67] for expressing the fact that the fear or astonishment arises from the agent of the causative (hetu-bhayé 1.4.55). 
Exception to 72 below. [NI-bhi-] normally takes the active while [smiN] takes the 
middle voice. 
1. In the example mundó bhi-s-dy-a-te 'the shaved head frightens', mundáh is the causative agent [hetú- 1.4.55] and is the source of the fear generated, but in mundáḥ kúñcikaya bhay-ay-a-ti 'the shaved head frightens with a bamboo shoot', the source of fear lies in the bamboo shoot and not in the shaved head. The form bhi-s-dy-a-te is generated by 7.3.40. 
2. Similarly in jatiló ví-smap-ay-a-ti (6.1.57; 7.3.36) rupena 'the person with matted 
hair astonishes with his appearance' the word rupa- is the source.

yáj-a-te 'performs a sacrifice for oneself', but yáj-a-ti 'performs a sacrifice for some one else'; similarly pác-a-te 'cooks for oneself', but pác-a-ti 'cooks for another'. Verbal stems have either (1) exclusively Parasmaipadá l-substitutes introduced after them or (2) Atmanepadá l-substitutes or (3) have either of them optionally. 12 
70 
above defines the class after which Atm. 1-substitutes are introduced exclusively, while the present rule specifies stems after which both sets are optionally intro- duced, subject to the conditions stipulated: viz. whether the action is intended for the agent or someone else. 78 below defines the class of stems after which Paras. 1-substitutes are introduced exclusively. The set of rules 13-71 are excep- tions to 72 where the stem is marked either with svaritá or N as IT, and to 78 
which is not so marked.

1.3.78 séṣāt kartári parasmaipadám 
After the remaining verbal stems (séṣat), when the agent (kartári) is to be denoted, Parasmaipadá l-substitutes are introduced. 
Such verbal stems are indicated in the Dhatupatha either with the udátta accent as an IT marker or by the absence of the markers N or Ñ if no recíprocal action is denoted (14). In the case of stems marked by svaritá or N as IT these endings occur only when the fruit of the action is intended for others and not the agent. In all cases where particular rules have not been formulated Parsmaipadá 1- substitutes are introduced. Now follow the particular rules regarding Ubhayapadíns or Atmanepadín stems after which Paras. I-substitutes alone are introduced.

[Parasmaipadá l-substitutes 78 are optionally 90 introduced after the class of verbal stems] whose first member is vft- 'exist' (= I 795-8) co- occurring with the markers syá and saN (respectively of the Future/Conditional and the desiderative derived stem).

761.4.1 á káḍārāt=ékā saṁjñá 
(In this section, beginning with this sutra) and ending with [káḍārāḥ karmadharayé 2.2.38] only one (éka) technical term (samjña) applies (to a given item). 
Thus 10 below defines the t.t. [laghú-] as a short vowel (hrasvá) (1.2.28) but the t.t. (gurú-] is defined as a long vowel (12) as well as a short vowel followed by a consonant nexus (11). Since two t.tt. now apply to a short vowel, viz. [laghú-, gurú-] only one of them can apply. This is provided by the following sutra. 
1.4.2 vipratisedhé páram käryàm 
When there is incompatibility (vipratisedhé) [between two rules which can equally apply in a given domain] what is provided by the subsequent rule (páram) should operate (käryàm). 
1. Since the short vowel has the option of two technical terms, a short vowel fol- lowed by a consonant nexus is uniquely [gurú] by this rule. The normal proce- dure adopted in framing the rules is to state the general rule (utsargá) first and the exception (apavadá) next, which blocks the utsargá within its particular domain. 
2. There has been much discussion about the domain of this metarule as governed by the preceding rule. Patanjali and the later Paniniyas extend this metarule over the whole of the corpus of Ast., and not up to the end of the second pădá of the second chapter (i.e., from 1.1.1 to 8.1.74), and where this fails in a few in- stances, the word [pára-] is rendered by interpretation to mean [istá- 'desired"] as leading to realizing the correct surface form. 
3. 6.1.77 [iko yaN aCi] rules in that the vowels [i,u,rl] are replaced by the cor- responding semi-vowels (y,v,r,l] before a vowel (aCi), while 6.1.101 [aKah sávarne dirgháh] rules in that the vowels [a,i,u,g, and the following homogeneous vowels are both replaced by the corresponding long vowel. In the example dádhi+idám both 77 and 101 situations apply equally since the bracketed word homogeneous (sávarne) is not a part of the utsarga or general rule 77, but by this metarule 101 uniquely applies. 
1.4.3 yu strī-akhyaú nadí 
(The t.t. [samjná 1]) nadi designates uniquely feminine (strī-akhyaú) nominal stems (ending in 1.1.72) the long vowels -ī or -u. 
1. As a t.t. occurs in 5.4.153; 6.1.173; 2.109; 3.44; 7.1.54,80; 3,107,112,116. 
2. In its non-technical sense of 'river' occurs in 2.1.20; 4.7; 4.1.113; 2.88,97. 
3. Examples of nadí type feminines: nadí 'river', vadhú 'daughter-in-law' which are uniquely feminine; exceptions are grama-ni m.f. 'village head', khala-pú m.f. 'sweeper' which are not uniquely feminine. 
77 
1.4.4 ná-iyaN-uváN-sthānau-á-strī 
[The t.t. nadí 3] does not (ná) denote [uniquely feminine stems ending in long vowels - or -u 3] if these endings are subject to replacement by -iy and -uv (respectively 1.3.10) [iyaN-uváN-sthānau] with the exception of the nominal stem strí. 
srf f. 'glory', bhrú f. 'eye-brow' are examples of this class: nom. voc. sing. srih, voc. sing. bhráh, nom. voc. acc. dual éríy-au, bhrúv-au contra nadf+8U = nadí+0 (6.1.68); nadí+au nady-au; nadf+8U (voc.) nádi+8U (7.2.107) - nádi+0 (6.1.69) nádi. Similarly voc. sing. (he) strí.

[The t.t. nadf 3] optionally (va) denotes [uniquely feminine stems ending in -ī or -u 3 which are subject to replacement by -iy, -uv respectively 4] before the SUP triplet am (6th or genitive plural).

(The t.t.) GHI denotes the remainder (sésah) [= stems (ending in 1.1.72) short -i, -u which are not uniquely feminine, as well as uniquely feminine stems which are not covered by the t.t. nadí] with the exception of sákhi- 'companion'. 
78 
agni- m. 'fire', vayú- m. 'wind' are examples of this class, while gáti-, dhenú- which 
are feminine but not members of the nadí-class, are also members of this class, but, optionally belong to the nadí-class before N-marked SUP triplets. 
1.4.8 pátiḥ samāsé-evá 
[The t.t. GHI 7] denotes the nominal stem páti- 'protector' when it occurs (at the end of) a compound (samãsé) only (evá).

páti +Ne = páty-e (6.1.77) praja-patí+Ne praja-paté+Ne praja-patay-e (6.1.78);

1.4.9 sasthí-yuktas chándasi vā 
[The t.t. GHI 7] optionally (va) denotes [the nominal stem páti-] co- occurring with a nominal stem (ending in 1.1.72) the sixth sUP triplet (sasthí-yuktah) in the domain of Chándas. 
kuluñcá-n-am pátay-e námah 'homage to the lord of Kuluncás'; kṣétrasya páti-na 
vayam 'we, with the master of the field'. 
1.4.10 hrasvám laghú 
(The t.t.) laghú denotes a short (hrasvá) vowel (1.2.28). 
1. A distinction is made here between a short (hrasvá) vowel and a metrically light (laghú) vowel. Whereas the absolute values of the vowel class are defined as one mora for the short, two for the long and three for the prolated, the concept of light (laghú) and heavy (gurú) has relevance only to the context of situation. 2. As a t.t. occurs in 5.1.131; 6.4.56-61; 7.2.7,94; 3.86; 4.93; 8.3.18. 
1.4.11 samyogé gurú 
(The t.t.) gurú denotes [a short vowel (hrasvá) 10] before a cluster (of consonants 1.1.7 samyogé). 
1. The word [gurú] indicates a metrically heavy syllable. In the expression agní- m. 'fire', the initial phoneme (vowel) is gurú since it is followed by two consonants; similarly in the expression mitrá- n. 'friend' and in yuddhá- n. 'war strife' vrddhá- mfn. 'grown', klptá- mfn. 'formed, effected', the short vowels (hrasvá) are metrically heavy (gurú) in the context of being followed by consonant nexi. 
79 
1.4.12 dirgháṁ ca 
[The t.t. gurú 11] also (ca) denotes a long (dirghá) vowel (1.2.28). 
In the expression tha f. 'desire' both vowels are metrically heavy (gurú) as the 
sonant vowel is in pitŕn. 
1. As a t.t. occurs in 3.3.103; 4.1.78; 5.1.132; 8.2.86. 
1.4.13 yásmāt pratyaya-vidhís tád-adi pratyayé=ángam 
In a unit after which (yásmat) an affix is introduced (pratyaya-vidhíḥ), the unit beginning with that is denoted by the t.t. ánga before that affix (pratyayé). 
1. In the three-fold set-up of the Ast. consisting of nominal and verbal stems [pratipadiká 1.2.45, dhátu 1.3.1; 3.1.32 and affixes (pratyayá) 3.1.1ff.] the nominal or verbal pre-affixal stem after which the affixes are introduced is defined by this t.t. Since a sentence (vakyà), the unit of thought in articulate speech, is analyzed into its component units consisting of a concatenation of stems and affixes, the pre-affixal base (whether nominal or verbal) requires a single t.t. for indicating the morpho-phonological processes needed to generate the sentences. It will be seen that these stems, under defined situations, have technical terms associated with them; besides [ánga] defined here, we have [padá 14] and [bhá 18] below. 
2. The 3rd pers. sing. Present Indicative (LAT) form su-nó-ti, dual su-nu-tás, su- 'distil' is an ánga before the class marker [Śnú] (= nú-), and the theme su+nú- is also an ánga before the SUP triplets [tip, tás]. 
3. As a t.t. occurs in 4.2.72; 6.4.1-7.4.97; 8.2.27; 3.78. 
1.4.14 SUP-tíN=antam padám 
[The t.t. 1] padá denotes an item terminating in (-antam) (nominal ending) SUP or (1-substitute) tiN triplet. 
1. In hára+8U, hárats is a [padá), and so also hará+am harám, haréna, harésu 
etc.

3. As a t.t. occurs in 2.1.1; 3.1.119; 8.1.16; 3.57; 4.1.38. 
1.4.15 naḥ Kyé 
[The t.t. 1 padá 14] denotes an item (ending in 1.1.72) the phoneme n before affix Kyá (= KyáŃ 3.1.11, KyáC 3.1.8 and Kyás 3.1.13).

1. rájan +KyáŃ+SaP+tá rája+ya+tá (8.2.7)= raja-ya+ta (7.4.25) = raja-ya-te (3.4.79). By 18 below, normally a pre-affixal stem is defined as BHA before in- itial [y] of an affix, so this is a prior exception to that rule. 2. rájan+KyáC+SaP+tiP raja+ya-ti (8.2.7)

'becomes like a coat of mail'. 
= varmá-ya-ti (7.4.25) 
1.4.16 S-IT-i ca 
[The t.t. 1 padá 14] also (ca) denotes an item before an affix with marker S as IT. 
H 
bhávat+chaS (4.2.115) bhavat+fya- (7.1.2) bhavad-fya- 'your honor's'; voicing of 
an unvoiced consonant can only take place at the end of a padá (8.2.39). 
1.4.17 sÚ-adiṣu-á-sarvanamasthāne 
[The t.t. 1 padá 14] denotes an item before the class of affixes whose first member is the SUP triplet sU (4.1.2) excluding those denoted by (the t.t. 1) sarvanāma-sthāná (= SUT 1.1.43 and Si 1.1.42 = strong case affixes). 
1. All affixes are dealt with in the three chapters of Ast. (3-5) and this class of af- 
fixes benning with sU (4.1.2) extends up to affix kaP (5.4.151). 
2. rájan+bhyam = rája+bhyam (8.2.7) rája-bhyam. 
1.4.18 y-aCi BHAM 
[The t.t. 1] BHA denotes an item before an affix with initial semivowel [y-] or any vowel (aC). 
= 
1. rájan+Sas = rántas (6.4.134) rájñ-as = rájñaḥ (8.3.15); similarly rájan+Ne 
= rájñ-e, rájan+Nas(1) = rájñ-as rájn-ah. 
= 
2. kata+yaN (4.1.105) kát-ya- (6.4.148) 'gotra descendant of Kata'; since [t of 
kat] is not at the end of a padá by its being a BHA 8.2.39 is blocked. 
3. As a t.t. occurs in 6.4.22-128; 129-75; 7.1.88; 8.2.79. 
1.4.19 ta-sau matU-arthe 
[The t.t. 1 BHA 18] denotes an item (ending in 1.1.72) the phonemes (-t, 
-s) before an affix having the meaning of affix matU(P) (5.2.94). 
= 
vidyút+matUP = vidyút +vatUP (8.2.10) vidyút-vat- 'possessed of lightning'; note that the stem-final unvoiced stop is not replaced by the voiced as required by 8.2.39 because the preaffixal stem is BHA and not a padá. 
81 
= 
yásas+vín- (5.2.121) yasas-vín- 'glorious' where stem-final [s] is not replaced by 
[U] (according to 8.2.66). 
1.4.20 ayasmaya=ādīni chándasi 
[The t.t. 1 BHA 18] denotes the stem in the class of expressions whose first member is ayas-máya- 'made of metal (or iron)' before affixes intro- duced after them, in the domain of Chándas. 
Some of these function as though both t.tt. apply to the pre-affixal stem: in [ayas-máya-] the pre-affixal stem functions like a BHA while in fc+vatUP = fk-vat- 'praising', the pre-affixal stem functions first as a padá in replacing the palatal stop by the corresponding velar unvoiced stop: fe+vat- fk-vat- (8.2.30) and it then functions like a BHA stem in blocking out the operation of 8.2.39 which would have required fk fg transformation. 
1.4.21 bahúsu bahu-vacanám

2. By 4.1.2 a set of 21 affixes are introduced after nominal stems, divided into seven triplets; similarly by 3.4.78 a set of 18 affixes are introduced as replacements for the 1-members (denoting tenses and moods), consisting of two sets of three triplets each. 102 below uses the three t.tt. [ekavacaná 'singular', dvi-vacaná 'dual' and bahuvacaná 'plural'] to denote the three members of each of these triplets. The present and the following sutras define the meaning of these terms; [bahuvacaná] here denotes the third member of each of these triplets. Sanskrit is the only Indo-European language to maintain the system of three numbers throughout its history.

1.4.23 kárake 
In the domain of Káraka. 
1. This is an adhikará (1.3.11) 'governing rule' beginning here and extending up to 55 below. Since the principal meaning of an utterance is an action denoted by a verbal stem, those things which bring about the development of that action are referred to by this term. Six of these are enumerated below: apadána (24) 'point of departure'; sampradána (32) 'point of arrival'; kárana (42) 'instrument'; adhikárana (45) locus, sub-stratum'; kárman (49) 'direct object' and kart (54) 'agent' and hetú (55) as 'causal agent' as its sub-type. The relationship between two or more kárakas can only occur through an action of which they are dif- ferent kárakas. Thus, with the exception of the sixth or genitive (sasthí) case, all the remaining sets of SUP triplets are káraka-forming affixes.

subsequent rules of this sub-section.

3. The two t.tt. [upasargá] and [gáti] as applied to this class are never in competi- 
tion since they are distinct. 
4. prá-kr-ta- is a tatpurusa compound by virtue of 2.2.18 and bears the udátta ac- cent on prá-, proper to a member of the [gáti]-class according to 6.2.49. Similarly in prá-kar-o-ti, pra- is an (upasargá] preceding the stem [kr-"] and retains its accent (8.1.28), but in sam-ud-á-nay-a-ti 'assembles' nay-a-ti loses its accent (8.1.28) while both preverbs sám-, úd- lose theirs by virtue of being assigned simultaneously the t.tt. [gáti] and [upasargá] by 8.1.70. 
1.4.61 ūrī ādi-Cvi-DáCaś ca 
[The t.t. 1 gáti 60] also (ca) denotes the class [of particles 56] beginning with ūrī- 'assent' and items (ending in 1.1.72) affixes Cvi (5.4.50) and DáC (5.4.57).

1.4.62 anukaranam ca=án=iti-param 
[The t.t. 1 gáti 60] also (ca) denotes an expression imitating (anukaranam) (natural sound), provided it is not followed by the particle iti (án-iti-param).

khat-iti kr+Ktvá khad iti kr-tvá. 
1.4.63 'ādará-án-ādarayoh sát- ásat-I 
[The t.t. 1 gáti 60] denotes the particles sát- and ásat- when they (respectively 1.3.10) denote respect (adará) and disrespect (án-adara).

93 
1.4.67 purás-ávyayam 
[The t.t. 1 gáti 60 denotes the particle 56] purás when it is indeclinable (ávyayam) (meaning 'in front'). 
NN 
purás+kr+Ktvá puras+kt+LyaP 
puras+kf+LyaP puras-kft-ya 'having placed in front (= honored). The indeclinable [purás] is derived from the word [púrva- 'front'] with affix (*-ás] 5.3.39; the word ávyaya is used to separate the nom. acc. pl. pur-ás from the fem. stem púr- 'fortified city' and so block the operation applicable to a gáti. 
1.4.68 ástam ca 
[The t.t. 1 gáti 60] also denotes [the indeclinable 67 particle 56] ástam 'setting, disappearance'. 
ástam+gam+Ktvá astam+ga0+LyaP = astam-gát-ya 'having set or disappeared' where [ástam] is an indeclinable ending in -m. while astá- (as+Ktá) is the pas- sive past participle of [as 'toss, throw' IV 100).

áccha+vad+Ktvá accha-uad+LyaP (6.1.15) = 
= 
accha-uad+LyaP (6.1.15) acchód-ya 'having saluted or greeted'. When it is not an indeclinable [áccha-] means 'pure' as a qualifying word (adjective). 
1.4.70 adáḥ-án-upa-dese

[The t.t. gáti 60] optionally (vibhāṣā) [denotes the particle 56 tirás 71] co-occurring wth the verbal stem krÑ 'do' (VIII 10). 
tirás-kr+Ktvá/tiras+ky+LyaP

[The t.t. 1 gáti 60 denotes the particle 56] pradhvám 'favorably' [co- occurring with verbal stem krÑ 72] when expressing the sense of 'bondage' (bándhane). 
= 
pradhvám+kr+Ktvá pradhvam-kr+LyaP = pradhvam-kft-ya 'having bound', but pradhvam kr-tvá sakatam gatáḥ has departed after making the cart suitable (for the road)'. 
pradhvám is an indeclinable in the above sense as a gáti, ending in the phoneme [-m] by 1.1.39, but prädhva- is a tatpurusa compound (2.2.18), in the counter- example. 
1.4.79 1jīvika-upanişádau-aúpamye 
[The t.t. 1 gáti 60 denotes the particle 56 expressions] jiviká- 'means of livelihood' and upanisád- 'the concluding part of a Vedic text' [co- occurring with verbal stem krN 72] when denoting comparison (aúpamye).

though it were an upanisad'. 
1.4.80 té prág dhátoh 
Those (té) = upasargá 59 and gáti 60] occur before the verbal stem (with relation to which they have the status of upasargá or gáti). 
Examples cited under sútras 59ff., already illustrate this. 
1.4.81 chándasi páre=ápi 
In the domain of Chándas [those gáti 60 and upasargá 59] also (ápi) oc- cur after (the verbal stem with relation to which they have the status of gáti or upasargá). 
váyav índras ca sunvatá á yatam úpa niskṛtám (RV 1.2.6) 'O Vayu and Indra, approach the rendezvous for the Soma pressing' where the preverb úpa follows. the verbal stem ya-tam. 
1.4.82 vyávahitaś ca 
[In the domain of Chándas 81 they (= gáti 60 and upasargá 59)] occur separated (vyávahitaḥ) (from the verbal stem with relation to which they have the status of gáti or upasargá). 
á mandraír indra háribhir yahi 'Come, O Indra, with the charming horses' (RV 3.45.1) where the preverb occurs before, but with intervention of three words. gámad vájebhir á sá nah 'may he come with gifts hither to us' (RV 1.5.3) where á 
occurs after the verbal stem with intervention of one word. 
1.4.83 karma-pravacanīyaḥ 
(Here begins the section on) karma-pravacaníya-s. 
This section covers subsequent rules up to 97 below. The t.t. [karmapravacaníya] denotes particles (nipätá 56) mentioned in the following sutras. They are truly governing prepositions (modifying substantive nominal stems) and modify a verbal stem, but differ from both upasargá and gáti. This is a governing rule, and the word [karma-pravacaníya] will recur in all subsequent rules up to 97 below. 
97 
1.4.84 ánur lákṣane 
[The t.t. 1 karmapravacaníya 83 denotes the particle 56] ánu when a characteristic (lákṣane) is to be indicated. 
Here the word [lákṣana] does not signify a mere characteristic, but 'cause' (hetú), cf. 90 below. parjányo jápam ánu prá-vare-a-t 'rain began falling after (= as a result of) muttering prayers'. The accusative of [jápa) is ruled in by 2.3.8. 
1.4.85 trtiya-arthe 
[The t.t. 1 karmapravacaníya 83 denotes the particle 56 ánu 84] when it has the value of the third SUP triplet (trtíya-arthe). 
nadím ánu-avasitá séna 'the army is situated (= encamped) by the river. The meaning of ánu here is equivalent to that of sahá which governs the instrumen- tal case 
1.4.86 hiné 
[The t.t. 1 karmapravacaníya 83 denotes the particle 56 ánu 84] when it is used to indicate 'inferior' (hiné). 
ánu sākaṭāyanám vaiyakaranah (all) grammarians are inferior to Ś.'; 
ánu-árjunam yoddharah 'all warriors are inferior to A.' 
1.4.87 úpaḥ-ádhike ca 
[The t.t. 1 karmapravacaníya 83 denotes the particle 56] úpa when used to indicate 'superior' (ádhike) as well as (ca) ['inferior' 86]. 
(a) superior: úpa niske karṣapanam 'the k. is superior to n.' and in this sense 
governs the locative case (2.3.9). 
inferior: úpa sakaṭayanám vaiyakaranáḥ. 
1.4.88 1ápa-2párī várjane 
[The t.t. 1 karmapravacaníya 83 denotes the particles 56] ápa and pári when they are used in the sense of 'exclusion' (várjane). 
98 
ápa2/pári2 trígartebhyo vrstó deváh 'it rained (everywhere) except in the region of Trígarta', but odanám pári-siñcati 'sprinkles rice (with water)' where the retroflexion of verb-initial by 8.3.59 indicates that [pári] here is not a karmapravacanĺya. The ablative case is used by virtue of 2.3.10 and reduplica- tion of the particles by 8.3.5. 
1.4.89 áŃ maryādā-vacané 
[The t.t. 1 karmapravacaníya 83 denotes the particle 56] áN when it is used to show a limit (maryada-vacané). 
Normally two types of limits are involved: [maryáda] 'exclusive limit' and [abhividhí] inclusive limit', but by using the compound expression [maryada-vacané] both types of limits are included here. á pataliputrad vrsto devah 'it rained up to (but excluding) Pataliputra; ablative by 2.3.10. 
1.4.90 'lákṣaṇa-2ittham-bhūtá-akhyāná-3bhagá-'vipsásu 
'práti-2pári-ánavaḥ 
[The t.t. 1 karmapravacaníya 83 denotes the particles 56] práti, pári and ánu when they are used to indicate (a) characteristic (lákṣana), (b) state- ment of fact (ittham-bhūta-akhyaná), (c) division (bhagá) and (d) dis- tributive function (vīpsá). 
1. vrksam práti/pári/ánu ví-dyot-a-te vidyút 'the lightning flashes in the direction 
of the tree'. 
2. sadhúr devadattó matáram práti 'D. is good towards his mother'. 3. yád átra mám práti/pári/ánu syát 'that it may fall to my share'. 
4. vrksám vrksám práti siñc-á-ti 'sprinkles tree after tree (= every tree with 
water)'. 
Since [ánu] here is denoted by the t.t. karmapravacaníya as well as 84 above, the special meaning of [láksana] is [hetú] 'reason, cause' and not a mere characteris- tic, and in this sense the káraka would be the instrumental case (2.3.23) which, though subsequent to (2.3.8) ruling in the accusative with karmapravacaníya, be- comes inoperative by the force of 1.4.84. 
1.4.91 abhír á-bhāge 
[The t.t. karmapravacaníya 83 denotes the particle 56] abhí when it is used to indicate [(a) a characteristic (lákṣana), (b) statement of fact (itthambhuta-akhyaná) and (c) distributive function (vipsá) 90] exclud- ing 'division' (ábhage). 
Exx. as in 90 above, but when division (bhaga) is denoted: yád átra mám abhí-syat 'whatever falls to my share, let that be given'; since [abhí-"] functions here as a preverb (upasargá), by 8.3.87 the initial [s] of the verbal stem is replaced by the retroflex sibilant. 
99 
1.4.92 'prátiḥ 'pratinidhí-'pratidánayoh 
[The t.t. 1 karmapravacaníya 83 denotes the particle 56] práti when it is used in the sense of 'representative' (pratinidhí) or 'exchange' (pratidána). 
1. abhimanyur arjunatáḥ práti 'Abh. is the representative of Arj.' 
2. máṣan asya tilebhyah práti yacch-á-ti 'he exchanges (= barters) his mása beans for sesame seeds'; (práti] in these meanings governs the ablative case (2.3.11). 
1.4.93 1ádhi-'párī ánarthakau 
[The t.t. 1 karmapravacaníya 83 denotes the particles 56] ádhi, and pári when they do not convey any meaning (án-arthakau). 
kútó yám ádhi/pári á-gacch-a-ti 'whence has he come?'. By being assigned this t.t. these particles are not subject to operations associated with them otherwise as upasargás [e.g., 8.3.87: adhi-syat or loss of accentuation 8.1.70]. 
1.4.94 súḥ pūjāyām. 
[The t.t. 1 karmapravacaníya 83 denotes the particle 56] sú when it in- dicates 'excellence, praiseworthiness' (pujáyām). 
sú siktám bhávata 'has been well sprinkled by you (honorific)'; sú stu-tám bhávatā 'has been praised well by your honor'; replacement of dental sibilant by the retroflex of the initial of the verbal stem after the particle is debarred (8.3.65). 
1.4.95 átir atikrámane ca 
[The t.t. 1 karmapravacaníya 83 denotes the particle 56] áti when it in- dicates 'overstepping, exceeding' (atikrámane) and also (ca) [excellence 94]. 
1. áti siktám evá bhávata 'you have only over-sprinkled'. 
2. áti stutám bhávata 'been praised well by your honor'. 
1.4.96 ápiḥ padarthá- sambhavana-3anvavasargá-'garhá- 
samuccayéşu 
[The t.t. 1 karmapravacaníya 83 denotes the particle 56] ápi when it in- dicates: (a) paucity of a substance (padarthá), (b) possibility or assump- 
100 
tion (sambhavana), (c) permission to do as one likes (anvavasargá), (d) censure (garhá) or (e) aggregation (samuccaya). 
1. sárpisah-ápi syát 'may be a drop of clarified butter'. 
2. ápi siñc-ét múlaka-sahasrám 'may be possible to sprinkle a thousand radishes'. 3. ápi siñc-á 'thou mayest sprinkle, if thou likest'. 
4. ápi stu-yat-ursalám 'he might even praise a low-caste person'. 
5. ápi siñc-á ápi stu-hí 'sprinkle as well as praise". 
In all these examples, as in the preceding sútras, the initial dental sibilant of the 
verbal stem is not replaced by the retroflex as required by 8.3.65. 
1.4.97 ádhir īśvaré 
[The t.t. 1 karmapravacaníya 83 denotes the particle 56] ádhi when it in- dicates 'master, lord, ruler' (iśvaré). 
ádhi pañcléṣu brahmadattáh/ádhi brahmadatté pañcaláḥ 'Br. is the rule of 
P.' (locative by 2.3.9). 
1.4.98 vibhāṣā krÑ-i 
[The t.t. 1 karmapravacaniya 56] 
optionally (vibhasa) denotes [the par- ticle 56 ádhi 97] co-occurring with verbal stem krÑ- 'do' (VIII 10). 
ádhi kr-tvá/adhi-kft-ya (*adhi+ky+LyaP] where it functions as a preverb, but in yád átra mám ádhi kar-i-syá-ti if it is [karmapravacanfya] it does not lose its accent as when it is [gáti] 8.1.71. 
1.4.99 laḥ parasmaipadám 
The t.t. 1] parasmaipadá denotes (the substitutes of) l-members. 
1. The cover symbol [1] stands for various tenses and moods: (a) IAT 'present indicative'; (b) IIT 'perfect'; (c) IUT 'periphrastic future'; (d) IRT 'sigmatic future'; (e) IET 'subjunctive mood'; (f) 10T 'imperative mood'; (g) laŃ 'imperfect tense'; (h) IIN 'optative or potential mood'; (i) IUN 'aorist'; and (j) IN 'conditional'. A sub-variety of IIN (= asir-IIN) is the Benedictive or Preca- 
tive mood. 
2. The substitutes of l-members are by 3.4.77-8: tiP, tás, jhi; siP, thás, thá; miP, vás, más; tá, átam, jha; thás, átham, dhvám; IT, váhi, máhiŃ, consisting of six triplets, each triplet representing in order the singular, dual and plural (1.4.101); the first and fourth belong to the third person (prathama-purusá), the second and fifth to the second person (madhyama-purusá) and the third and sixth to the first person (uttama-purusá) (1.4.102). This general rule (utsargá) stipulates that all these l-substitutes are denoted by the t.t. [parasmaipadá]. The following rule is an exception (apavadá) to this general rule. 
101 
1.4.100 táŃ-2amaú-atmanepadám 
[The t.t. 1] atmanepadá denotes [the substitutes of l-members 99] in- dicated by [the siglum] táN [= tá átam jha, thás átham dhvám, íT váhi máhiN] and the affix-aná- [-SanáC KanáC]. 
This is an exception to the preceding rule which constitutes the general rule (utsargá). Since by 99 táN is included within the t.t. [parasmaipadá] while this assigns it to [atmanepadá], by rules 1-2 of this padá the t.t. [atmanepadá] will uniquely or exclusively denote (táŃ, aná] while the rest of l-member substitutes are uniquely [parasmaipadá]. 
1.4.101 tiÑas tríņi tríni 'prathamá-'madhyamá=3uttamáh 
[The t.tt. 1] prathamá 'third', madhyamá- 'second' and uttamá 'first' respectively (1.3.10) denote the three (and) three triplets of tiN [parsmaipadá and atmanepadá 99-100]. 
The repetition of the word [tríni] is to cover both [parasmaipadá and atmanepadá] l-substitutes. It may be noted that what is 'third person' in western grammati- cal terminology is here prathamá (lit. 'first') while the 'first person' is [uttamá 'highest']. The word [púrusa] associated with these triplets is considered by Paniniyas as a pre-Paninian technical term. 
1.4.102 táni=1ekavacaná-2dvivacaná-3bahuvacanáni ekasáḥ 
Those (táni)= [three and three triplets of tiN 101] taken one by one (ekaśáh) have the [t.tt. 1] ekavacaná 'singular, dvivacaná 'dual' and bahuvacaná 'plural' to denote them respectively (1.3.10). 
[ekavacaná] 'denoting one', [dvivacaná] 'denoting two' and [bahuvacaná] 'denoting many' are represented respectively as follows: singular: tiP, siP, miP; tá, thás, iT; dual: tás, thás, vás, átam, átham, váhi; plural: jhi, tá, más; jha, dhvám, máhiŃ. 
1.4.103 sUpah 
[The triplets 101] of the affixes denoted by the siglum SUP = SU au Jas, am auŢ Śas, Ta bhyam bhis, Ne bhyam bhyas, Nasl bhyam bhyas, Nas os am, Ni os suP 4.1.2 taken one by one have the t.tt, ekavacaná, dvivacaná and bahuvacaná to denote them 102 respectively). 
1. ekavacaná: SU, am, Ta, Ne, NasI, Nas,and Ni.. 
2. dvivacaná: au, auT, bhyam, bhyam, bhyam, os, and os. 
102 
3. bahuvacaná: Jas, Sas, bhis, bhyas, bhyas, am and sup. 
4. These seven triplets of sUP have respectively been given the t.tt. prathama 'first' (nominative), dvitiya 'second' (accusative), trtiya 'third' (instrumental), caturthi 'fourth' (dative), pañcami 'fifth' (ablative), sasthí 'sixth' (genitive) and saptamí 'seventh' (locative) cases [vibhákti 104 below]. 
1.4.104 vibhaktiś ca 
[Each set of three triplets 101] has [t.t. 1] vibhakti to denote it [for tiŃ 101 as well as SUP 103]. 
As a t.t. occurs in 1.1.38; 2.44,64; 3.4; 2.1.8,; 5.3.1-27; 6.1.168; 3.132; 7.1.73; 8.4.11. 
1.4.105 yuşmádi-upapadé samaná-adhikarane sthaníny= ápi madhyamáḥ 
Madhyamá (second person) triplets are introduced (after a verbal stem) when (the pronominal stem) yusmád 'you' co-occurs as an upapadá 'subordinate word' (= subjoined or complementary item) either expressed (sthaníni) (or implied) and denotes the same thing (samaná-adhikarané) (= or is in general grammatical agrement). 
Thus: (tvám) pác-a-si, (yuvám) páca-thas, (yuyám) pác-a-tha 'thou art cooking, you

1.4.106 prahasé ca mánya-upapade manyáter uttamá ekavát=ca 
When irony (prahasé) is indicated and the verbal theme mán-ya- "think" (IV 97) co-occurs as an upapadá 'complementary word' [madhyamá triplets are introduced after (the principal) verbal stem 105] but the uttamá (first person) triplet singular (uttamá ekavát) is introduced after the verbal stem mán-ya. 
ehí mánye odanám bhok-syá-se 'come, thou thinkest: "I will eat the rice" (but there is no rice, all of it has been eaten by the guests)'. When irony is not intended the phrase will read as ehí mányse odanám bhok-sy-e 'come, thou art thinking: "I will eat rice" (thou thinkest well)'. 
103 
1.4.107 asmády uttamáh 
Uttamá (first person) triplets are introduced [after a verbal stem] when (the pronominal stem) asmád- 'we' [co-occurs as a complementary word (upapadá) either expressed (or implied) and denotes the same thing 105]. 
(ahám) gácch-a-mi, (avám) gáccha-vas, (vayám) gácch-a-mas respectively meaning 
'I go, we two go, all of us go'. 
1.4.108 seṣé prathamáh 
Prathamá (third person) triplets are introduced (after a verbal stem) when (a pronominal stem) other than (seṣe) [yusmád 105 and asmád 107] co-occurs as a complementary word (upapadá) either expressed or im- plied and denotes the same thing [= or is in grammatical agreement 105]. 
pác-a-ti, pác-a-tas, pac-anti (he, she, it) cooks, they two cook, they all cook' respec- 
tively. 
1.4.109 páraḥ samnikarsáḥ sámhita 
[The t.t. 1] sámhita 'placing together' denotes the maximum contiguity (sam-nikarşáh) [of phonemes]. 
An interval of half a matra is supposed to denote this maximum contiguity: 
dádhi+átra dádhy-átra (6.1.77) 'curds here'. 
= 
As a t.t. occurs in 1.2.39; 6.1.72-157; 3.114-39; 8.2.108. 
1.4.110 viramáḥ avasanam 
[The t.t. 1] avasána denotes cessation (viramá of articulation pause, pausa). 
As a t.t. occurs in 8.3.15; 4.56.

2.1.1 samartháḥ pada-vidhíḥ 
An operation (vidhí) on padás (1.4.14ff.) (takes effect) only when they are semantically and syntactically connected (samartháḥ). 
This is a metarule (paribhasa) and whenever such operations are involved, the word [samarthá] 'semantically and syntactically connected' is to be understood. The compound raja-purusá-h alternates with rájn-ah púrusa-h and both derive from the underlying deep structure [*rájan+Nas+púrusa+sU] denoting 'servant of the king'; now in the string like bharyà rájñaḥ, púruso devadattásya 'wife of the king, servant of Devadatta', although rájñaḥ púrusah are contiguous padás, the operation of compounding is blocked, despite 2.2.8, since there is no semantic relationship connecting these two. Similarly by 24 below we have the string kastám sritáḥ [*kastá+am+sritá+SU) kastá-sri-tah, but in the string pasya dévadatta káṣṭam, śritó visnudattó gurukulám 'look at the trouble O Devatta, Visnudatta has taken refuge in the teacher's house' there is not any semantic relationship between the two contiguous padás kastám sritáh in this string which will permit the derivation of a compound. 
2.1.2 SUP ámantrite para-angavát sváre 
[An expression ending in 1.1.72] SUP triplets occurring before a vocative (ámantrite) [with which it is semantically and syntactically connected 1] is treated as an integral part of the subsequent pre-affixal stem (para angavát) with respect to accentuation (sváre). 
By 6.1.198 the initial syllable of a vocative bears the udátta accent; thus in the ex- pression úrjo napat sahasvan 'O mighty son of strength' the pada [urj+Nas] precedes the vocatives napat sahasvan and bears the udátta accent on its first syllable. 
2.1.3 prák káḍārāt samāsáḥ 
[The t.t.] samasá 'compound' denotes (all items resulting from the ap- plication of subsequent rules in this section) prior to (prák) [the sútra (káḍāraḥ karmadharayé) 2.2.38]. 
This is a governing rule and the word [samasá] recurs in the whole of this section. 
2.1.4 sahá sUP-a 
[An item ending in (1.1.72) SUP triplets 2] combines with (sahá) another item (ending in 1.1.72) SUP triplets [to generate a compound 3]. 
This is also a governing rule and the three words [SUP 2] and saha sUP-a will also 
105 
recur along with samarthá 1 and samãsá 3] in the subsequent rules of this sec- tion. Thus in 14 below [dvitiya śrita-atīta etc.] the ellipsis is filled in by [dvitiya(antam 1.1.72) SUP(antám 2) śritá-adibhih sUp(antaíh 1.1.72) samarthaíh 1 sahá 3 sámasyate 3]. 
2.1.5 avyayi-bhāváḥ 
[The t.t.] avyayi-bhavá [compound 2] denotes all items derived by the application of subsequent rules (up to 21 below). 
This is also a governing rule. All such rules are deemed to have the svaritá accent 
(1.3.11). This t.t. will recur in all the rules from 6 to 21. 
2.1.6 ávyayam 'vibhakti-'samīpá-3samŕddhi-'vy-fddhi-

An indeclinable (ávyaya) [ending in (1.1.72) a SUP triplet 2 combines with 4 a semantically and syntactically connected nominal padá (sUPa) 4 to form an avyayibhavá 5 compound 3] if it is used to connotate: (1) what is denoted by a nominal (SUP) triplet (vibhákti 1.4.104), (2) proximity (samīpá), (3) prosperity (samfddhi), (4) adversity (vyŕddhi), (5) absence of an object (artha-abhavá), (6) a passing (away) (atyayá), (7) now is not the proper time (á-samprati), (8) the appearance of a sound (sabda-pradurbhavá), (9) posteriority (paścát) (10) the sense of [yátha], (11) sequence (ánupurvya), (12) simultaneity (yaúgapadya), (13) similarity (sádrsya), (14) fulfilment (sampatti), (15) completeness (sákalya) and (16) end or terminus (antavacaná). 
1. strīsú ádhi-krt-ya

adhi-stri 'with reference to women'. 
upa-kumbhám 'near the pitcher'.

anu-rathám (padatám) (the infantry) is behind 
9. ráthanam pascát (padatám) 
the armed chariots'. 
10. There are four meanings of [yátha]: (a) fitness (yogyáta), (b) repetition (vīpsá), (c) similarity (sádṛśya) and (d) not going beyond (án-ati-vrtti) of something 
106(padartha). 
(a) anu-rupám

12. cakréna yugapád sa-cakrám 'simulataneously with the wheel'. 
13. sadrsáḥ sákhy-a sa-sakhi 'like a friend'. While normal similarity is already covered by the meaning (c) of (yátha) under (10) above, [sádrsya] here means non-essential secondary similarity. 
14. ksatráṇām sampattiḥ 
sa-kṣatrám 'as befitting a warrior'. 
15. trnam ápi-á-pari-tyaj-ya sa-trnám 'right down to a blade of grass'.

2.1.7 yátha-á-sādŕye 
[The indeclinable 6 nominal stem 2] yátha [combines with a syntactically and semantically connected 1 nominal padá 4 to form an avyayībhavá 6 compound 3] except when it signifies 'resemblance' (á-sadṛśye). 
yatha-vyddhám brahmanán á-mantr-ay-a-sva 'invite every old brahmin', but yátha devadattás tátha brahmadattáh 'B. resembles D'. In the compound sa-harí il- lustrating 6 (10 d) above, the meaning of sádréya] in that compound is a property of [sahá] which is replaced by [sa-] by 6.3.81 and not of [yátha], since in this sense it is debarred from forming a compound.. 
2.1.8 yávad avadharane 
[The indeclinable 6 nominal padá 2] yávat [combines with 4 a syntac- tically and semantically connected 1 nominal padá 4 to form an avyayībhavá 6 compound 3] when it is used to signify 'limitation' (avadhárane). 
yavad-amatram brahmanán á-mantr-ay-a-sva 'invite as many brahmins as there are pots', but yavad dattám távad bhuktám 'it was eaten so long as it was served' (i.e., one had no idea of how much was actually eaten). 
2.1.9 SUP prátina matra-arthé 
An item (ending in 1.1.72) SUP triplets [combines with 4 the indeclinable nominal padá 2] práti [to form an avyayībhāvá 6 compound 3] when it indicates 'a bit' (matra-arthé). 
sáka-pratí sakasya matra 'a little (quantity) of vegetables'; supa-pratf 'a little of 
= 
107 
soup', but vrksám práti ví-dyot-a-te 'lightning flashes in the direction of the 
tree'. 
The repetition of the word [SUP] here while it was recurring from 2 above is to 
block the recurrence of [ávyaya 6] in the following sutras. 
2.1.10 1akṣa-salākā- samkhyāḥ páriņā 
[The nominal padás 2] akṣá- 'dice', salākā 'a small ivory stick used in gambling' and numerals (samkhya) [combine with 4 the indeclinable nominal padá 4] pári [to form an avyayibhavá 6 compound 3]. 
This particular formation is restricted to gambling games and has relevance to a game known as Pañcika in which five dice or ivory sticks are thrown; in a given throw when all five face upwards or downwards the player wins, otherwise he loses. Thus aksa-pari 'unlucky throw of dice'; similarly salaka-parí 'unlucky throw of sticks'; eka-parí, dvi-parí 'unlucky by one, two, etc." 
2.1.11 vibhāṣā 
The word [vibhāṣa] 'optionally' (governs the subsequent rules beginning with this section and ending with 2.2.35). 
This governing rule provides that compounds are hereafter formed by subsequent rules optionally which implies that compounds thus formed alternate freely with the uncompounded string of [padás] from which the compounds are derived. It also implies that the compounds generated by rules 6-10 are obligatory (nítya) compounds. 
2.1.12 'ápa-pári-bahís-1áñcavaḥ pañcamyá 
0 
[The indeclinable nominal padás 2] ápa-, pári-, bahís- and items (ending in 1.1.72) --añc- [optionally 11 combine with syntactically con- nected 1 nominal padás 4] (ending in 1.1.72) the fifth sUP triplet (pañcamya) [to form an avyayībhavá 6 compound 3].

pare-gangám/paré gángayah 'across the river G.'; or by 2.2.28 ganga-parám; the operation of this would have been blocked by the present rule if the particle [va] were not used. Similarly madhye-gangám/mádhye gángayah/ganga-madhyam "in the midst of the river Ganges'. 
2.1.19 samkhyá vámśyena 
A numeral (samkhya) [ending in 1.1.72 SUP triplets 2 combines with 4 a syntactically connected 1 nominal padá 4] denoting a 'lineal descendant' (vámsyena) [to form an avyayibhāvá 6 compound 3 optionally 11].

[The t.t.] tatpuruşá (samasá 'compound 3] (denotes compounds formed by subsequent rules in the section beginning here and ending with 2.2.23 below).

2.1.23 dvigúś ca 
[The t.t. tatpurusá 22 samasá 3] also (ca) denotes [the compound 3] named Dvigú (52 below).

khatvarudha- 'gone astray', but kháṭvām árudhah 'ascended the bed' does not con- vey censure, and so when censure is to be implied, the compound is necessarily formed contra the governing rule 11 above. Cf. 6.2.147 for accent. 
2.1.27 samí

garbhíní ca asaú gaús ca go-garbhinf 'a pregnant cow'. Composition here is restricted to words denoting species (játi), hence no composition takes place in the string kalaksi garbhini 'the cow named Kalaksi is pregnant',

Since the single substance with parts is referred to as forming the posterior member of a compound, the sixth sUP triplets are introduced after it (technically known as [avayava-sasthí]). This rule is a prior exception to 8 below. 
1. púrvam kayasya 
2. áparam käyásya 
purva-kaya-h 'front of the body'. 
apara-kaya-h back of the body'. 
3. adhara-kaya-h lower part of the body'. 
4. uttara-kaya-h 'upper part of the body'. 
In a Karmadharaya compound púrvas ca asaú käyás ca purva-kaya-h the refer- 
ence is not to a part of the body but to the whole body. 
2.2.2 ardhám nápumsakam 
[The nominal padá 1.2] ardhám (used as a neuter: nápumsakam) 'half' (but not as a qualifier) [combines with a nominal padá 1.4 denoting a single substance consisting of parts 1 to form a tatpurusá 1.22 compound 1.3].

Isat-pingalá-h 'slightly brownish'; Isat-kadará-h 'a little tawny. (Cf. 6.2.54 for 
alternative accent iṣát-kaḍāra-.) 
Note: A varttika modifies this rule by replacing [á-krt-a] by [guna-vácanena]: Pánini himself has the compound [isad-a-samaptí] 'slight incompleteness' (5.3.67). 
2.2.8 şaşthí 
[A nominal padá 1.2 ending in 1.1.72] the sixth SUP triplet (sasthí) [combines with 1.4 a syntactically connected 1.1 nominal padá 1.4 to form a tatpurusá 1.22 compound 1.3].

Words forming this class end in the affix [-tfC or -aka-] and by 16 below do not combine with a prior member ending in the sixth sUP triplet, and so this rule is a prior exception to that: brahmanasya yajaka-h/ brahmana-yajaká-h 'performer of a sacrifice for a brahmin'. 
2.2.10 ná nirdhárane 
[A nominal padá 1.2. ending in 1.1.72 the sixth sUP triplet 8] introduced. (by 2.3.42) to denote a setting apart (nirdhárane) does not (ná) [combine with 1.4 a syntactically connected 1.1 nominal padá 1.4 to form a tatpuruşá 1.22 compound 1.3].

All krt affixes are markers of the agent (3.4.76) and so do not enter into com- 
130 
position with a genitive having the value of an agent (16 below); its inclusion here is with reference to the taddhitá affixes only. Similarly [trC) is an agent marker (3.1.133) and has its domain in the subsequent sútra.

Since the affix [tŕC] does not occur in these two senses, the affix involved is [aka] 
only, though both are present by anuvitti. 
1. sport: úddalaka-puspa-bhanjika 'n.pr. of a sport in which Uddalaka flowers are 
crushed' (6.2.74 for accent).

(The t.t.) bahuvrīhí denotes residual (séṣaḥ) [compounds 1.3] (with respect to those provided by 2.1.6-2.22). 
This is a governing rule up to 28 below. Since only padás ending in sUP triplets other than the first have been dealt with in the preceding section 2.1.6-2.22, the first SUP triplet constitutes this residue. 
2.2.24 ánekam anya-pada-arthé 
Two or more (án-ekam) [nominal padás 1.2 can combine with 1.4 each other] to denote something distinct (from what is implied by the con- stituent padás) (anyapada-arthé) [to form a bahuvrīhí 23 compound 1.3].

2.4.22 chayá báhulye 
[A tatpurusá 19 compound 1.3 not co-occurring with náÑ-° or a karmadharayá 19 compound 1.3 is neuter in gender 17] when it (ends in 7.1.72) the word chayá 'shadow' to express profusion (báhulye) of the preceding member. 
salabha-cchayám 'shadow (cast by a huge cloud) of locusts'; ikṣúnam chayá 
iksu-cchayam 'shadow (cast by a thick grove) of sugar-cane', but kudya-cchayá f. 'shadow of a wall'. 
2.4.23 sabhá rája(n)=2a-manuṣyá-pūrvā 
от а 
[A tatpurusá 19 compound 1.3. not co-occurring with náÑ- karmadharayá 19 compound 1.3. is neuter in gender 17] provided it (ends in 1.1.72) the word sabhá 'assembly' and co-occurs after (synonyms of) the word rájan 'king, ruler' or a word denoting a non- human being (a-manuṣyá-purvā). 
In this rule tha word [rájan], contra metarule 1.1.68 does not represent itself, but only includes its synonyms: iná-sabham royal court or assembly', but raja-sabhá. Similarly pisa-ca-sabhám 'assembly of pisacas', but devadatta-sabhá. Cf. 6.2.98. 
2.4.24 á-sālā ca

Here the word [sabhá] denotes 'a concourse': stri-sabham 'a concourse of women'; 
162 
dāsí-sabham 'a group or crowd of maid-servants', but á-natha-sabha 'a poor house'. Cf. 6.2.98.

2.4.26 paravát-lingám 'dvaṁdvá-'tatpurusáyoḥ 
The gendar of a dvamdvá or tatpurusá compound 1.3 is that of the final member (parval-lingám).

mayuri-kukkutaú m. 'peahen and cock'. 
2. tatpurusá: ardhám pippalyah = ardha-pippalf I. half a berry'. 
3. By a varttika this rule is blocked in the case of dvigú compounds and those oc- curring with prapta-, ápamna- and álam as prior members, as also gáti com- pounds: pañcásu kapáleṣu sámskṛtáḥ pañca-kapalá-h purodasá-h; práto jívikām - präpta-jviká-h; ápanno jívikam = apanna-jiviká-h; álam jfvikayai = alam-jiviká-h; nis-kranta-h kausambyah nís-kausambi-h 
2.3.27 pūrvavát-áśva-vaḍavau 
= 
[The gender of the dvaṁdvá 26 compound 1.3] áśva-vadavau is that of the prior member (pūrvavát). 
This is an exception to 26 by which the string ásvas ca vádava ca would have been 
realized as "ágva-vadav-e (f.) 'stallion and mare". 
2.4.28 'hemanta-sisiraú-'aho-ratré ca=chándasi 
In the domain of Chándas [in the dvamdva 29 compounds 1.3] hemanta- sisiraú and aho-ratré [the gender is that of the prior member 27]. 
163 
The word [sisira-] is both m. and n. and when it is n. the string hemantás ca éísiram ca hemanta-sisiraŭ m. 'autumn and winter seasons', and the string áhas ca rátris ca aho-ratrám n. day and night', contra hemanta-sisire n., and aho-ratraú m. in the spoken language. 
2.4.29 'ratrá='ahná-3aháḥ púmsi 
[The gender of a dvamdva 26 compound 1.3] (ending in 1.1.72) the (samasanta 5.4.87,88,89) words-ratrá-, -ahná- or -ahá- is masculine (púmsi). 
This blocks the rule 26 above. 
1. dvi-ratrá-h, tri-rätrá-h 'a period of two/three days'. 
2. purvahná-h/aprahná-h/madhyahná-h 'forenoon/afternoon/noon". 3. dvy-ahá-h, try-ahá-h 'two or three days'. 
2.4.30 ápatham nápumsaksm 
[The tatpuruşá 26 compound 1.3] á-patham is neuter (napumsakam). 
na pánthah = náN+pathinta (5.4.76)

á-pathin+a (6.3.73) = á-path00+a á-path+a+8U = á-path-a+am (7.1.73) á-path-am (6.1.107) = ápatham idám 'this is a wrong/bad road or path'; but in a bahuvrihí compound: á-path-o désa-h 'a pathless tract'. 
2.4.31 ardharcáḥ púmsi ca 
The class of [compounds 1.3] beginning with ardharcá- 'half a strophe of rk', is masculine in gender (púmisi) and also (ca) [neuter 30]. 
ardharcá-h/ardharc-ám; gomayá-h/gomay-ám 'cow-dung'; kasaya-h/kasay-am 
'decoction'. 
2.4.32 idámaḥ-anvadeśé-as-ánudattas tṛtíya-adau 
The low-pitched (ánudatta) substitute as replaces (the whole of 1.1.55) idám- 'this' before all SUP triplets beginning with 
beginning with the third (trtíya-adau) when it is used anaphorically (anvadeśé). 
abhyam chatrabhyam ratrír ádhita, athó abhyam áhar ápy ádhitam 'These two- pupils studied the whole night, and then they studied the whole day'. When [idám-] is used the first time, by 6.1.168 and 171 the udatta accent falls on the SUP triplets from the instrumental singular onwards, but not when it occurs anaphorically with as replacement. The proper purpose of this rule, however, is 
164 
in connection with forms ending in ákaC- (5.3.71): imákabhyam chatrabhyam ratrír ádhita, athó abhyam áhar ápy ádhitam 
2.4.33 etádas tra-tasós tra-tasaú ca-ánudāttan 
o 
[The low-pitched (ánudatta) substitute as 32 replaces the whole of 1.1.55] etád- 'this' before the affixes tra- (5.3.10)and -tas- = (tasiL 5.3.7) and both affixes tra- and tas- become low-pitched (ánudattau) [when etád is used anaphorically 32].

2.4.34 'dvitīya-2Ta-3ós-su-enaḥ 
[The low-pitched substitute 32] ena- replaces (the whole of 1.1.55) [idám- 32 and etád- 33 when used anaphorically 32] before SUP triplets of the second (dvitíya vibhakti 1.4.104) as well as before Ta (= 3rd sing.) and os (= 6th and 7th dual). 
1. imám chátrám chándah-ádhyap-ay-a, athó enam vyakáranam ápy ádhy-ap-ay-a 'teach this pupil chándas, and teach him grammar also'; simlarly etám chátrám chándo-ádhy-ap-ay-a, athó enam vyäkáranam ápy ádhy-ap-ay-a.

Before 1-substitutes of IIT the verbal stem krN (VIII 10) is also (ca) in- troduced as an auxiliary (ánu-pra-yuj-ya-te) [after 2 the affix 1 ám 35]. 
By interpretation (vrtti) the expression [kr] is regarded as a siglum [praty-a-har-á] derived with [kr] of 5.4.50 and it-marker N of [krÑ-ab) of 5.4.58 so as to in- clude the other two auxiliary verbal stems [bhú-] and [as-] as well. Thus from the causative stem derived from pac+NICHIT pac-i+am+01+kr/bhu/ as+NaL = pac-ay-ám ca-kár-a/ba-bhúv-a/ás-a 'caused (someone) to cook'. The verbal stem [as-] is not replaced by [bhú-] as required by 2.4.52 when it serves as an auxiliary before l-substitutes of IIT.

3.1.43 Cli IUN-i 
[The affix 1] Cli (marker of Aorist) is introduced [after 1 a verbal stem] before the l-substitutes of IUN (Aorist). 
Cli is the cover term for all markers of the Aorist, as will be seen from the sub- sequent rules where it is replaced by other substitute markers. This is the most diverse tense in the language: (1) Root Aorist (Cli replaced by 01 2.4.77); (2) aŃ Aorist (52 below); (3) Reduplicated or CaN Aorist (48 below); (4-7) Sigmatic Aorists: (4) siC Aorist (44 below); (5) Ksa Aorist (45 below); (6) iT+siC Aorist (7.2.35) and (7) s+it+siC Aorist (7.2.73).

The operation of 7.2.35 affecting árdhadhätuka affixes beginning with vaL (= all consonants other than y) is circumscribed by specific rules (7.2.8ff.) and by 7.2.10 where verbal stems which are monosyllabic and have a low pitch (ánudatta) accent block out this increment and are thus defined as án-iT stems. sprs+IUN = apré+Cli+t = spre+Ksa+t=

3.1.92 tá-tra-upapadám saptami-sthám 
There (= in this section: tátra, headed by the governing rule 91) the t.t. upapadá denotes a form ending in (1.1.72) the seventh sUP triplet (saptami-sthám). 
1. as a t.t. occurs in: 1.3.16,71,77; 4.105,106; 2.2.19; 3.14; 5.3.57; 6.2.139. 
2. as a non-technical term it denotes 'a complementary form subjoined', cf. 1.4.106.

133 below introduces affixes Nvul and tfC after all verbal stems while 135 intro- duces affix Ká after verbal stems containing iK (= i, u, f, !) as penultimate; since the two sets are not identical in shape, a verbal stem such as kaip- 'cast, throw' (IV 14, VI 5) has both of them introduced after it: vi+ksip+NouL/tfC/Ká = vi-keep-aka-/vi-ksep-tf-/vi-ksip-á- since 135 does not block the operation of 133. On the other hand 3.2.1 introduces affix áN after a verbal stem co-occurring with a nominal stem ending in the second SUP triplet, while 3.2.2 introduces af- fix Ká if the verbal stem ends in the vowel phoneme -a and is not preceded by a preverb; since áN and Ká are identical in shape (= á) the latter (apavāda) blocks the preceding (utsargá). 
With reference to feminine affixes 3.3.94 introduces KtiN to form feminine action. nouns: kr+KtiN kr-ti- 'action', while 3.3.102 introduces affix [á] after deriva-

A varttika, however, blocks the operation of the meta-rule 1.3.10 by stating that [dhma] co-occurs with both while dheT co-occurs only with [stana-]; this inter- pretation is derived from the fact that the dvamdva compound [nasika-stanáy-oh] contravenes the operation of 2.2.34.

[The kft 1.93 affix 1.1] KviP is introduced [after 1.2 the verbal stem 1.91 han- 86, co-occurring with nominal padás 4] bráhman- 'brahmin', bhrūņá- 'embryo' and vṛtrá- 'n.pr. of a demon, destroyed by Indra' [functioning as its direct object 86 to denote the general past tense 84]. 
brahman+am+ha-távan - brahman +01+han+KviP 
= 
brahmal+hán- 'who has murdered a brahmin'; similarly bhruna-hán-/vrtra-hán- respectively denoting 'who has killed the embryo / the demon Vṛtra'. 
In view of the general rule 76 introducing this affix after all verbal stems, there is a four-fold application derived from that fact: (a) KviP is introduced after [han-] when co-occurring with these three nominal padás only; (b) with these three úpapadas only, (han-] is followed by this affix, not other verbal stems; in brahma adhi-tavan it is inoperative; (c) with these úpapadas it is only to denote the general past time that KviP is introduced after [han-]; in brahmanam hán-ti 'kills a brahmin', it is inoperative; and (d) also in bráhman-am han-i-eya-ti 'will kill a brahmin' it is inoperative. 
3.2.88 bahulám chandas-i 
In the domain of Chándas [the kft 1.93 affix 1.1 KviP 87] is variously (bahulám) introduced [after 1.2 the verbal stem 1.91 han- 86, co- Occurring with other nominal padás 4 functioning as its object 86 to denote the general past tense 84).

[The kft 1.93 affix 1.1 KviP 87 is introduced after 1.2 the verbal stem 1.91] krÑ 'do, perform' (VIII 10) [co-occurring with nominal padás 4] sú- 'well', kárman- 'work', papá- 'sin', mántra- 'sacred hymn', and púnya- 'virtue, merit' [functioning as its object 86 to denote the general past tense 84]. 
= 
= 
sú+kr+KviP su-kf-tyK+0 (6.1.71) sobhanam kr-távan 'who has done well'; similarly: karma-kf-t-, papa-kf-t-, mantra-kf-t, punya-kf-t- respectively denot- ing: 'who has performed all work/committed a sin/composed a sacred hymn/ done a virtuous deed', 
There is a three-fold application here: (a) this affix is applicable only when denoting the general past time: in karma kr-távan KviP alone is applicable, not áN (1); (b) with other úpapadas, KviP is not applicable, but only áN as in mantram adhi-tavan = mantradhyay-á- 'who has studied sacred hymns'; (c) through intro- ducing Kvip in the general past tense, it is not applicable when other tenses are indicated: mántram kari-syá-ti/kar-6-ti mantra-kar-á(N) 'who will compose/is composing sacred hymns'. Since no regulation is intended, in the view of the recurrence of the word [bahulám 88], this rule is applicable also with other úpapadas: bhasya-kf-t-/sastra-kf-t 'who has composed a commentary/ treatise on science' respectively. 
3.2.90 sóm-e suÑ-aḥ 
= 
[The kft 1.93 affix 1.1 KviP 87 is introduced after 1.2 the verbal stem 1.91] suÑ- 'press or distil the Soma' [co-occurring with the nominal padá 4] sóma- [functioning as its object 86 to denote the general past tense 84). 
= 
sómam su-táván soma+au+KuiP soma-sú-t- 'who has pressed Soma'. Here

The repetition of the word [karman-i] here while it is already recurring from 92 above is to indicate not 'an object' as defined by 1.4.49 but to denote a despicable or unworthy act and censure the agent of the verbal stem: sómam ví-kri-tavān = soma+01+vi-kritin soma-vi-kray-in- 'who has sold Soma' im- plying censure; but dhanya+vi-kr1+áN dhanya-vi-kray-á- 'who has sold grain' with no censure implied.

Since Pánini himself uses the form (praśná- in 3.2.117: praśn-e ca-a-sanna-kal-é] it is inferred that vocalization (sam-pra-sárana) replacement does not take place before affix náN despite 6.1.16. 
3.3.91 svap-ah-naN

The affix KtiN, by virtue of its marker N, places the udátta accent on the initial syllable of the verbal stem (6.1.197) but in these instances in the Mántra portion of the Veda, it is shifted to the affix itself. 
vrs+KtiN = vrs-tí (8.4.1) 'rain, precipitation'; is-tí- wish, desire, request' (besides icchá/is-ti- 101); pak-tí- 'cooking'; man+KtiN ma-ti (6.4.37) = ma-tí- 'thinking, thought'; vit-tí- 'knowledge'; bhu-tí- 'becoming'; vi-tí- 'enjoyment'; ra-tí- 'giving, bestowing'. 
Other than in the Mantra, the accent falls on the initial syllable of the derived form.

(The irregular expressions) u-tí- 'help', yu-tí- 'junction', ju-tí- 'speed', sa-tí- 'destruction', he-tí- 'missile' and kir-tí 'renown' are introduced [as derived with kft 1.93 affix 1.1 KtiN 94 bearing the udátta accent 96 and form feminine 94 action nouns 18]. 
P

av+KtiN = u-ti- (6.4.20); yu/ju+KtiNyu-tí-, ju-tí-; 80+KtiN = 8a-tí- (6.4.42) without replacement of semi-vowel by vocalization as required by 7.4.40, or al- ternately: san+KtiN 8a-KtiN (6.4.42) sa-tí-; han+KtiN = ha-i-KtiN= he-tí- (irregular replacement of /n/ by /i/ or hi+KtiN with irregular replace- ment of stem vowel by guna contra 1.1.5) he-ti-; krt+KtiN kirt+KtiN kirt-tí- (7.1.101), whereas by 107 below affix [yuC] is to be introduced. 
3.3.98 vrájá-'yaj-or bhav-é KyáP

vráj+KyáP+TaP (4.1.4) vraj-yá+ā = 
= 
vraj-yá (6.1.161) 'roaming, wandering'; 
similarly yaj+KyáP+TaP = ij-ya (6.1.15,1616) 'worshipping, sacrificing'. The marker [P] has no relevance here but is required for the following sutras for 
insertion of augment [tuK] (6.1.71).

3.3.99 samjña-yam 'sám-ajÁ-'ní-şada-'ní-páta-'manA- 5vídá-suÑ-7siN-8bhrÑ-IN-ah 
[The kft 1.93 affix 1.1 KyáP 98 bearing the udátta accent 96 is intro- duced after 1.2 the verbal stems 1.91] sám+aj- (I 248) 'collect together', ní+sad- (I 907, VI 135) 'sit down', ní+pat- (I 898) 'fly or settle down, alight', man- 'think' (IV 67), víd- 'know' (II 55), su- 'press, extract or distil soma juice' (V 1), si- 'lie down, sleep' (II 27), bhr- 'bear' (III 5) and IN- 'go'(III 36) [to form action nouns 18 or denote a káraka other than the agent 19] to derive names (samjñá-yam) [in the feminine gender 94].

couch'; ni-pat-ya 'slippery ground'; man-yá 'nape of the neck' (cf. Vede mán-ya); vid-ya 'knowledge'; su-t-yá (6.1.71) 'day for pressing soma juice'; say-yá (7.4.12) 'bed, bedstead'; bhr-t-yá 'service for wages' i-t-yá 'palanquin'. 
Because of the use of the expression (samjñá] here, the allomorph [vi] does not 
replace the verbal stem [aj-] before affix [KyaP] as required by 2.4.56. 
3.3.100 krÑ-aḥ Śá ca 
[The kft 1.93 affix 1.1 KyáP 98 with udátta accent 96] as well as (ca) Šá are introduced [after 1.2 the verbal stem 1.91] krÑ- 'do, make, perform' (VIII 10) [to form a derivative in the feminine gender 94]. 
This sútra is split into two parts by interpretation: krN-ah and Sá ca in order that with the first part [KyaP] is introduced and with the second part both KtiN (94) and Śá are introduced, yielding three derivatives: kr+KyaP+TaP = kr-t-yá / kr+Śá+TaP = kritáta (7.4.28) kriy-á (6.1.77) / kr+KtiN kf-ti 'act, ac- tion, activity, performance'.

is-yá-te = is+yak+Śá+TaP = icch+0(irregular replacement of yaK)+a+a

The class of stems beginning with [bhid-] is to be inferred not from the Dhatu-patha, but from the Gana-patha where the derived forms are listed in the feminine gender beginning with [bhid-á). 
Verbal stems with marker S: jrS (vayo-hän-aú IV 22)+áN+TaP- jar-á (7.4.16) 'old 
age, senility'; trapU-S (lajja-yam 1 399): trap-á 'bashfulness, shyness'. bhid+aN+TaP = bhid-á 'breaking'; chid-á 'cleaving'; guh-á 'cave'; a-r-á 'bore,

similarly: puj-á 'worship'; kath-á 'narrative'; kumb-á 'thick petticoat' and carc-á 'discussion'. 
Normally this would have been a prior exception to 107 below, but by interpretation of the particle [ca] here, this rule will not block the operation of affix [yuC]: cint+yuC+TaP cint-aná cini-á.

3.3.106 aT-as-ca-upa-sarg-é 
[The kft 1.93 affix 1.1 a 104] is also (ca) introduced [after 1.2 verbal stems 1 91 ending in 1.1.72] the phoneme [-a] co-occurring with preverbs (upa-sarg-é) [to form feminine 94 action nouns 18].

The uN-adi-sutra-s which list these affixes do not constitute an integral part of the Ast, but are included in the kft section (3.1 above); as such they should normally denote the agent, but by this general rule they are introduced to denote other kárakas as well: krs-i-tá-h as-aú krs-f- (direct object) 'agriculture, cultivation'; tan-ya-te an-éna tán-tu(N) 'thread' (instrument) and car-i-tá-m a-smín = cár-man- 'skin' (locus, substratum).

3.4.77 la-sya 
In the place of l-members. 
This is a governing rule extending up to the end of this chapter. The cover term for 1-members is either 1 (69 above) or la. The expression [la-sya] will recur in each of the following sutras in this section.

343 
Literally speaking, these are replacements [= in the place of 77 above] of l-members. All these eighteen substitute affixes are designated by the siglum (praty-a-hará) tiN (1.4.101). Parasmaipadá (active voice) is assigned to all 1-members by 1.4.99, modified by the next following sutra 100 whereby the siglum taN denotes mem- bers constituting the Atmanepadá (middle voice). Thus the first nine are Parasmaipadá endings and the second nine are Atmanepadá endings. They are further classified into three triplets each (1.4.101) constituting three persons: third, second and first. In that order, and within each triplet they constitute the three numbers: singular, dual and plural (1.4.102). The t.t. vibhakti applies to them (1.4.104). 
3.4.79 T-IT-ah-atmanepadá-nām TE-r e 
The phoneme [e] is the substitute for the syllable commencing with the last vowel of Atmanepadá l-substitutes (taN) [of l-members 77] with marker T as IT (= IAT, IIT, IUT, IRT, IET and 1OT). 
tá, átam, jha; thás, átham dhvám and IT- váhi and mahi are respectively replaced by t-é, át-e, á(n)t-e; sé, áth-e, dhv-é; é, váh-e, máh-e of l-members having T as an IT marker.

[The l-substitutes of l-member 77] IOT 'Imperative Mood' are like those of [l-member 77] IAN 'Imperfect'. 
By the recurrence of [va] from 83 above, interpretation limits this equivalence to a few substitutes only, introduced by 99 and 101 below; 99 refers to the replace- ment of final [-s] of vás and más, and 101 refers to the replacement of tás-thás-thá-miP respectively by tám-tám-tá-am. Thus pac+1OT

pác+SaP+si = pác-a+hí - pác-a+01 (6.4.106). The recurrence of marker P of sip which would apply to its substitute (1.1.56) is specifically blocked out by this rule.

The affixes in question are ti, tás, thá of Paramaipada. and tá, thás, átam and átham of Atmanepada. The actualization of the phoneme [s] of these increments is realized only in the Precative Mood (IIN asís-i) since they are replaced by Ø in the Optative by 7.2.79.

This is a governing rule heading this section, extending up to the end of the fifth chapter, and will recur in the following sutras as required in each individual case. [Ni] is the cover term for [NIN, NIP and NŕS] which are introduced in the follow- ing rules; and similarly [aP] is the cover term for [CaP, TaP and DaP]. While items ending in these affixes are also pratipadikás, their inclusion in this govern- ing rule is for the purpose of fixing the relative position of these affixes with reference to others introduced in this large section. 
Three classes of affixes are included in this major section: (a) declensional affixes (2); (b) feminine affixes (3-91); (c) secondary nominal affixes denoted by the t.t. taddhitá (76ff. which is a very large group). Certain classes of affixes must fol- low feminine affixes, like the declensional affixes which necessitates their inclu- sion in the governing rule.

These twenty-one affixes constitute the declensional endings, divided into seven triplets (1.4.103) denoted by the t.t. [vibhakti 1.4.104], and in the order in which they appear have the appropriate ordinals denoting them: [prathamá] 'nominative' (with vocative as a sub-class) (sU-au-Jas); [dvitíya] 'accusative' (am-auT-Sas); [trtíya] 'instrumental' (Ta-bhyam-bhis); [caturthf] "dative' (Ne-bhyam-bhyas); [pañcamí] 'ablative' (Nasl-bhyam-bhyas); [sasthi] 'genitive' (Nas-os-am); [saptamí] 'locative' (Ni, os, suP). In the order in which they ap- pear in each triplet they denote the singular, dual and plural endings (1.4.102). The application of these endings are given in 2.3.2ff. together with 1.4.22-23. 1.

[The affix 3.1.1 Nís 40 is not 56 introduced after 3.1.2 the nominal stems 1 denoting a part of one's body occurring as a subordinate mem- ber in a compound 54] preceded by ("-purv-at) the prior members sahá 'with, accompanied by', the privative particle náÑ and víd-ya-m-ana- 'existing, present' [to derive a feminine 3 nominal stem 1]. 
sahá kés-air várt-a-te sá-kesa+TaP sákes-a 'hairy'; so also a-kes-á 'bald, 
hairless' and vid-ya-m-an-a-kes-a 'possessing hair, hairy, hirsute'. 
4.1.58 'nakhá-múkh-at samjñá-yām 
[The affix 3.1.1 Nís 40 is not 56 introduced after 3.1.2 the nominal stems 1] nakhá- 'nail' and múkha- 'face' [occurring as subordinate mem- bers in a compound 54 to derive a feminine 3 nominal stem 1] when it signifies a proper name (samjñá-yam).

tamra-nakh-f 'red-nailed' and candra-mukh-f 'moon-faced'. 
370 
4.1.59 dirgha-jihv-f ca-chándas-i 
In the domain of Chándas the expression [dirgha-jihv-f] 'long-tongued' is introduced [as derived with affix 3.1.1 Nís 40, contra 54 above, to sig- nify a name 58]. 
Exception to 54 since the expression [jihvá] has a conjunct penultimate and the inclusion of particle [ca] is for the recurrence of [samjñā-yam) from 58: 'n.pr. of a demonness'. 
4.1.60 dík-pūrva-pad-at NIP 
[The affix 3.1.1] NIP is introduced [after 3.1.2 a nominal stem 1 denoting a member of one's body and not containing a conjunct penultimate 54] preceded by a direction word (dík-purva-pad-at) as a prior member [to derive a feminine 3 nominal stem 1]. 
Affix NIP replaces NiS wherever it was introduced by previous rules, under these 
specified conditions. 
The difference is only in accentuation: prán-mukha+NIP/TaP = prán-mukh-1/-mukh-a 'facing east', but prág-gulph-a (conjunct penultimate) 'having the ankles turned towards the east' (54). 
4.1.61 váh-aḥ

In the domain of Chándas, however, no affix is needed: sákha saptá-pad-i bhav-a 'be my companion in seven steps (around the nuptial fire)'. Similarly a-sisú-m iva mám ay-ám éíóu-r abhí-man-ya-te 'this child considers me (f.) as childless'.

odana-paká+NÍS = odana-pak-f 'Barleria Caerulea'; similarly: sanku-karn-í 'having pointed ears'; sala-parn-f 'n.pr. of a plant'; sankha-pusp-f 'n.pr. of a plant species'; dasi-phal-f, darbha-mül-f, go-val-f'names of various plants'. 
4.1.65 IT-ah-manusya-jāté-h 
[The affix 3.1.1 NÍS 40 is introduced after 3.1.2 a nominal stem 1 ending in 1.1.72] the phoneme short (T) denoting a human species (manusya-jaté-h) [to derive a feminine 3 nominal stem 1].

4.1.87 bahú-ant-at samjñá-yam 
[The affix 3.1.1 úŃ 66 is introduced after 3.1.2 a nominal stem 1] ending in the expression -bahú 'arm' (in composition) [to derive a feminine 3 nominal stem] forming a personal name (samjña-yam). 
bhadra-bahu+ú = bhadra-bah-á 'n.pr. of a woman' but vrttaú bahu a-8yáh 
vrttábahu- 'possessing rounded arms'.

= 
This covers such cases where comparison is not involved. sam-hitaú úrú a-syáh sam-hitóru+ú sam-hitor-i 'whose thighs are joined'; similarly: saphor-i since the hoof is joined. Although in the underlying struc- ture saphaú iva sám-slistau urú a-syah the expression [ival showing com-

married to sage Kasyapa'. kamandal-ú 'n. of an animal'. 
4.1.73 'sarigaravá-adi-'aÑ-ah-NIN 
[The affix 3.1.1] NIN is introduced [after 3.1.2 the nominal stem-class 1] beginning with sarigaravá- 'n.pr. of a person' and those [ending in 1.1.72 the affix 3.1.1] aÑ [to derive a feminine 3 nominal stem 1].

[The affix 3.1.1] CáP is introduced [after 3.1.2 a nominal stem 1 ending in 1.1.72 the affix 3.1.1] yaN [to derive a feminine 3 nominal stem 1]. 
By interpretation the affix [yaN] here serves as a cover term for taddhita affixes 
[NyaN and SyaN] respectively introduced by rules 171 and 78 below. 
= 
1. NyaN: ambasthá+NyaN (171)+CáP = ámbasthya+á ambasthy-á 'a woman of 
the Ambasthá country'.

2. SyaŃ: kroda+iN (96) kraud-i+SyaN (80)+CáP = kraudo+ya+á kraud-y-á 
(6.4.148) 'female descendant of Kroda'. 
4.1.75 ávaṭy-at-ca 
[The affix 3.1.1 Cáp 74] is also (ca) introduced [after 3.1.2 the nominal stem 1] ávatya- 'descendant of Avata' [to derive a feminine 3 nominal stem 1]. 
avata+yaNavat-ya+CaP (105) avat-y-á 'female descendant of Avata'. 
4.1.76 taddhit-áh 
= 
(Here begins the section on) taddhitá [affixes 3.1.1]. 
This is a governing rule extending up to the end of the fifth chapter. The t.t. [taddhitá] designating the affixes introduced in this section, will recur in each of the subsequent sutras. 
As a t.t. occurs in: 1.1.38; 2.46,49,76ff.; 3.8; 2.1.51; 4.1.17,22; 5.4.92; 6.1.61,164; 
2.155; 3.39,62; 4.133,144,150,151; 7.2.117ff. 8.1.57; 3.101. 
4.1.77 yún-as tí-h 
[The taddhitá 76 affix 3.1.1] tí is introduced [after the nominal stem 1] yúvan- 'youth, teen-ager' [to derive a feminine 3 nominal stem 1]. 
yúvan+tí = yuva+tí (8.2.7)= yuva-tf- 'maiden, young woman'. 
4.1.78 1áN-IN-or án-arṣay-or gurú-upottamay-os-SyáŃ gotr-é 
[The taddhitá 76 affix 3.1.1] SyáŃ replaces [the taddhitá 76 affixes 3.1.1] áN and iÑ introduced as patronymics (gotr-é) [after 3.1.2 a nominal stem 1] containing a heavy penultimate syllable (gurú-upottamay-oh) exclud- ing the names of fșis 'seers' (án-arṣay-oh) [before a feminine 3 affix 3.1.1].

Kumuda-gandhí'. 
= 
varaha-sya apatya-m = varaha+iN (95) = várah-a+SyaN+Cáp = varah-y-á 'female 
descendant of Varaha'.

heavy penultimate syllable: upagu+aN+NIP (15) aupa-gavá (6.4.146)+1= aupagav-f female descendant of Upagu'; (b) names of sages: vásistha+áN+NIP (15,114) vasisth-f 'female des- cendant of Vásistha'. 
= 
4.1.79 gotra-avayav-át 
[The taddhitá 76 affix 3.1.1 SyaN replaces the taddhitá 76 affixes 3.1.1 áN and iN 78 introduced after 3.1.2 nominal stems 1] representing well- known families (gotra-avayav-át) [before a feminine 3 affix 3.1.1]. 
punika sya apatya-m = punika +iN (95) SyaN+CáP (74) = paunik-y-d 'female des- 
cendant of Punika". 
This rule is for including expressions which do not have a heavy penultimate syl- lable. Here the word [gotrá-] is not taken in its technical sense (162) so that even the daughter of Punika will be denoted by paunik-ya. 
4.1.80 kraúḍi-adi-bhyas-ca 
[The taddhitá 76 affix 3.1.1 ṢyaN 78] is also (ca) introduced [after 3.1.2 the class of nominal stems 1] beginning with kraúd-i- 'descendant of Krodá' [to derive a feminine 3 nominal stem 1). 
The role of [SyaN] differs here from that in 78-79 where it is a replacing element [adesá] while here it is a regular affix [pratyayá]. This [kraúdi-class] includes expressions not necessarily ending in the affixes áN or iN or containing a heavy penultimate syllable: kraúd-i+SyaN+CáP kraud-y-á 'female descendant of Króda'; similarly caupayat-y-á 'f. descendant of Copayata'.

4.1.81 1daíva-yajñi-saúci-vṛksi-'sátya-m-ugri- 
kánthe-viddhi-bhyah-anya-tará-syam 
[The taddhitá 76 affix 3.1.1 SyaN 78] is optionally (anya-tará-syam) in- troduced [after 3.1.2 the nominal stems 1] daíva-yajñ-i, saúci-vrks-i, sátya-m-ugr-i and kánthe-viddh-i- [before a feminine 3 affix 3.1.1]. 
= 
daiva-yajn-i+SyaN+CáP/dalva-yajni+NÍS (65) daiva-yajn-y-á/daiva-yajn-f 'female descendant or daughter of Deva-yajna'. Likewise: sauci-vrks-y-á/ vrks-I; satya-mugry-á/satya-m-ugr-í; kanthe-viddh-y-á/viddh-f, respectively 'female descendants or daughters of Suci-vrkṣa, Satya-m-ugra and Kanthe-viddha'. 
3764.1.82 sámartha-nam pratham-át=vā 
[A taddhitá 76 affix 3.1.1] is introduced optionally (va) [after 3.1.2] the first (pratham-át) padá syntactically (and semantically) connected with others (samartha-nam) (provided by the rules themselves). 
This is a governing rule and the three words [sámartha-nam], [pratham-át] and [va] will recur in this section extending up to 5.2.150 as required by the context. Thus in 92 below [tásya-ápatyam] the first expression (tá-sya] represents any nominal stem denoting the name of a person syntactically and semantically con- nected with [ápatya-m] and the affix [áN 83] is generally introduced after such a name to denote a descendant optionally so that úpago-r ápatya-m/upagu+άN = aupagav-á- can be optionally used in any given context. 
4.1.83 prág divyat-aḥ=áN 
[The taddhitá 76 affix 3.1.1] áN is introduced [after 3.1.2 a nominal stem 3.1.2] (under meaning conditions listed in the subsequent rules) prior to (prák) 4.4.2 [t-éna dív-ya-ti khán-a-ti jáy-a-ti ji-tá-m]. 
This is also a governing rule or [adhikará] extending up to the end of the third quarter of this chapter. The affix [áN] is the [utsargá] or general affix which may be replaced by others under specific conditions to be stated in the sub- sequent rules. 
4.1.84 aśva-patí-adi-bhyas=ca 
[The taddhitá 76 affix 3.1.1 áN 83 is introduced] also [after 3.1.2 the nominal-stem-class 1] beginning with (-adi-bhyas) asva-patí- 'n.pr.' (to denote the meanings listed in this section). 
This listing of meanings begins with 92 below; the present padá primarily deals with 
patronymic affixes, but with 2.1 a variety of meanings is listed. 
This is a prior exception to 85 below where affix [Nyá] is introduced. asva-patí+áN 
= aeva-pat-á (6.4.148; 7.2.117) asva-pat-á- 'descendant of Asvapatí (92)'.

Similarly praja-patí+Nyá praja-pat-ya-m hávi-h 'sacrificial oblation sacred to Prajapati' (2.24); if the sense of 92 is specified, 6.4.148,151 applies for replace- ment of syllable [ya] of [adityá] before the affix [Nyá] to derive the patronymic. The nominal-class beginning with [asva-pati-] is a prior exception to this. 
4.1.86 útsa-adi-bhyah-aÑ 
[The taddhitá 76 affix 3.1.1] aÑ is introduced [after 3.1.2 the nominal- stem-class 1] beginning with útsa- 'well' [to denote the meanings listed in this section 83ff.].

Only one patronymic (gotr-é 162) [affix 3.1.1] is introduced [after 3.1.2 a nominal stem 1] to denote a gotrá descendant (at whatever level). 
[Gotrá 162] is defined as a descendant commencing from the grandchild; a restric- tion is, therefore, necessary to indicate a descendant beyond the grandchild and the recursive use of these affixes. Thus the son of Gargá will be garga+iN (98) = garg-i-, and his son will be garga+yaN gárg-ya- (105) since he is a gotrapatya (162) of Gargá; now the son of this Gárgya will also be Gárgya-.

The affix [CpháN] has two IT markers; C here governs the accent (6.1.163) and N

4.1.100 hárita=adibhyah-aÑ-aḥ 
[The taddhitá 76 affix 3.1.1 pháK 99 is introduced after 3.1.2 the class of nominal stems 1] beginning with hárita- 'n.pr.' [ending in 1.1.72 the sixth SUP triplet to denote a gotrá 98 descendant 92] while [terminating in 1.1.72 the taddhita 76 affix 3.1.1] aN (104). 
This class of nominal stems is a sub-set of the "bidá-class" (104) by reason of which [aN] is introduced after it to denote a gotrá descendant. Thus the gotrá descen- dant of Hárita is hárita+aN hárit-a- and by the present rule is also hárit-a+pháK = harit-ayaná- when he is at the same time a yúvan descendant (163). This obviates the restriction of the governing rule 93 above.

= 
vatanda+yaN vatand-ya- 'gotrá descendant of V belonging to the Angirasá clan', otherwise vatand-d (N 83). According to commentaries beginning with Käsika this expression is included in the class of stems beginning with siva- (112) after which taddhitá affix [áN] is introduced, but since it occurs as No. 22 in the list, it is an open question whether 83 or 112 is relevant here. Similarly this is also included in the gargá- class, but its specific mention here is for the purpose of restricting it to an Angirasa only. 
4.1.109 luK striy-ám 
luk (01) replaces [the taddhitá 76 affix 3.1.1 yaÑ 105 introduced after 3.1.2 the nominal stem 1 vatanda- 108 ending in 1.1.72 the sixth SUP triplet 92 to denote] a female (striy-ám) [gotrá descendant 98 represent- ing the Angirasá clan 107].

Since this stem is in- cluded in the siva-class of expressions (112) affix [áN] is also introduced, but is blocked by 108 when designating an Angirasá. 
4.1.110 aśva adibhyaḥ pháK

sivá+áN = saiv-á- 'descendant of Sivá'; with this sútra the expression (gotr-é 98] does not recur, and consequently represents (ápatyam 92] instead. So affix [áN] introduced after the nominal stem [vatanda-] can equally result from 83 or 112 when not referring to an Angirasá (cf. 108). 
vatanda+N= vatand-á- 'a descendant of Vatanda other than an Angirasá'.

= 
= 
ekagara-m pra-yój-ana-m a-sya ekagará+thaN aikagara-ika- (literally) 'whose object is an empty house (eka+agara)'= a thief. This rule has been contradicted by the Várttika-kärá and Patanjali since they accept the position that the word has the udatta accent on the first syllable. Others indicate the irregularity in confining the meaning to a thief only, while a third view of interpretation holds that the affix is [ikaT] with irregular vṛddhi of the initial syllable *aikagar-fka-, and the marker[T] then provides for the feminine form *aikagar-ik-T (4.1.15) while [thaN] yields afkāgar-ik-í (4.1.15). 
5.1.114 á-kal-ika-T-ady-antá-vac-an-e 
The (unusual) expression ákalikaT is introduced to denote beginning and end (of an action: an instantaneous action) [as derived with the taddhitá. 4.1.76 affix 3.1.1 thaN 18 by 109 above]. 
= 
This rule also is contradicted by the Värttikakärá, but Patanjali tries to justify it 
by indicating that the expression [samana-kalá-] is the original stem which is ir regularly replaced by Já-kala-a-vrtta-kala-]; the unusualness of the expression is with respect to its meaning only. Some interpreters (including Kas) posit, as in 112, the affix [ikaT) and both Värt. and Bhas, add another affix [thaN]. samana-kal-aú ady-ant-aú a-syá akala+thaN/(thaN) á-kal-ik-1/(á-kal-ik-a) - vi-dyút (lightning which is) momentary or instantaneous'; á-kal-ika-h stan-ay-itnu-h (thunder which is) instantaneous' (= having the beginning and. ending at the same moment)'. The difference between the two affixes is with. reference to feminine forms only. If [ikaT] is regarded as the affix in question the form would be: a-kal-fka- (m.)/-ik-1.

recur in each of them.

Since [kím] is normally included in the sub-class of pronominal stems headed by [dví-], its separate mention at the beginning of this rule is to block out the exclu- sion applying to this sub-class. kú-tas(iL 7), kú-tra(L 10) but dvá-bhyam, dváy-os. This excluded sub-class consists of duí-, yusmád-, asmád, bhávatU and (kim).

The present rule confirms the position of [ádhuná 17] as a taddhitá vibhakti affix rather than an irregularly formed expression. In view of the Vedic form adhuná one would have to associate marker [C] with that affix.

Interpretation attempts to analyze these surface forms as consisting of nominal stems ending in the seventh SUP triplet to indicate the period of time with re- placement elements and a variety of vibhaktí affixes which cannot be general- ized. The method of nipatana in these cases is the briefest and avoids prolifera- 
tion of rules.

Two (dv-é syllables) replace the first [prathamá-sya] syllable (of a verbal stem which contains) a single syllable (ékāC-ah). 
This is a governing rule (adhi-kar-á-) heading this section extending up to 12 below, and the three expressions will recur in each of them. The purport of this rule is to state that the first syllable of a mono-syllabic verbal stem is reduplicated un- der conditions stipulated in the subsequent rules. 
6.1.2 áC=āde-r dvi-tiya-sya 
[Two syllable 1] replace the second (dvi-tíya-sya) syllable [of a verbal stem] beginning with (-ade-h) a vowel (aC-") (and contains two or more syllables). 
This is also a governing rule having the same extension as the above and is an ex- ception to 1 above. The expression [dvi-tiya-sya] implies that the verbal stem consists of at least two syllables. 
Rule 1 is illustrated by pac-: *pac-pac-. 
Rule 2 is illustrated by: at+saN at+iT-saN (7.2.35; 3.1.32) 
= 
-at-i-sa- the 
desiderative derived stem from the simple stem at- containing three syllables, beginning with an initial vowel: a-t-i-sa-: a=ti-ti-sa (8.3.59). 
6.1.3 ná-n-d-r-aḥ sam-yog-á-aday-aḥ 
The phonemes [n, d, r] constituting the initial of a consonant nexus (sam-yog-á-aday-ah) [forming part of the second syllable of a polysyl- labic verbal stem beginning with a vowel 2] are not (ná) [duplicated 1].

6.1.4 púrva-h abhy-as-á-h 
The technical term (t.t.) abby-as-á denotes the first [púrva-h] of [these two replacements 1]. 
Thus in pac-pac- the first half bears the t.t. abby-as-á or reduplicated syllable; 
similarly in a-ti-ti-sa-, un-di-di-sa-, ad-di-di-sa-, ar-ci-ci-sa-..

6.1.5 ubh-é abby-às-ta-m 
The t.t. abhy-ás-ta- denotes both [replacement syllables 1 of the verbal stem]. 
As a t.t. (a) abhy-as-á- occurs in 1.3.71; 3.2.6; 6.1.7-12, 17,136; 4.78, 119-126; 7.3.55-58; 4.55-97; 8.3.61,54; 4.21,54 and (b) abhy-às-ta- occurs in 3.4.109; 6.1.33, 189, 190, 192; 4.112-13; 7.1.78-79; 3.87. 
6.1.6 jáks-i-ti-aday-aḥ sat 
[The t.t. abhy-ás-ta- 5] denotes the six (verbal stems) beginning with jáks-i-ti (in addition to itself). 
These seven verbal stems are: jáks- 'eat', jágr- 'wake up', dáridra- 'be needy', cákās- 'shine', sás- 'chastise', dídhi- 'reflect' and vévi- 'move', constituting nos. 62-68 of the second class of verbal stems beginning with ad- 'eat'. 
6.1.7 túj-ādī-nam dirghá-h-abhy-as-á-sya 
The long [vowel 1.2.28] replaces (the vowel) of the reduplicated syllable (abhy-as-á-sya) of the class of verbal stems similar to túj- 'strike, hurt' (I 163). 
In the expression [túj-adi-] the word [-adi-] denotes 'similar to' and the class is to be constituted from actual occurrences in the language, since it is not listed in the Gana- or Dhatu-patha-s. Examples are: tú-tuj-ana-, má-mah-ana-, da-dhár-a, tu-táv-a. Such forms occur only in the Chándas: tu-tój-a etc. in non-Chandas usage.

6.1.158 án-udatta-m padá-m eka-várja-m 
With the exception of one syllable (eka-várja-m) [for which an udátta 'high-pitch' or svaritá 'circumflex, high and low pitch' accent is introduced] a padá (1.4.14ff.) bears the ánudatta 'low pitch' accent. 
This is a metarule governing accentuation. Accent rules introduce either an udátta or svaritá- accent on a particular syllable of a padá, the rest bearing the anudatta accent. A nominal stem (pratipadiká) or a verbal stem (dhátu) or an affix (praty-ayá) has its particular udátta or svaritá accent, and when a padá is generated by a combination of stem and affix, the padá bears the udátta or svaritá accent on a single syllable, the rest being ánudatta. Thus by 162 below the final syllable of a verbal stem is considered to bear the udátta accent in general. Thus from the verbal stem lu- 'cut' (IX 13) we derive the theme lú+Śná where the class-marker also bears the udátta accent, so that the theme will be lu-ná- before l-substitutes tiP, tás, ánti, generating the Present Indicative forms lu-ná-ti (tip being anudatta by 3.1.4), lu-ni-tás, lu-n-ánti; further if we derive the comparative form lu-ni-tás+taraP+ám we arrive at lu-nitas-tar-á-m. A grammatical form or padá may consist of stems (pra-kf-ti), increments (ágama), replacements (adesá) and affixes (praty-ay-á), each of which may be bearing its own accent, but when the surface form emerges it can have only one accented syllable, leaving all others without accent. The last step in the successive deriva- tion will determine the final position of the accent in the padá. 
6.1.159 1kars-á-2áT-vat-aḥ GHaÑ-ah-ánta=udátta-h 
The final syllable (ánta-h) of an expression [ending in 1.1.72 the krt 3.1.93 affix 3.1.1] GHaN bears the udátta accent when it is derived from [the verbal stem 3.1.91] krs- 'draw, drag' (VI 6) or from those containing the vowel phoneme long /a/ (áT-vat-ah). 
This is a prior exception to 197 below. Under normal conditions the marker N of GHAN introduces the udátta accent on the initial syllable of the derived form. krs+GHaN kars-á- (7.2.86) 'dragging, ploughing'; pac+GHaN pak-á- (7.2.116; 
6963.52) 'cooking'; rañj+GHaN rag-á- (4.27) 'dying, coloring'; da+GHaN = da+yuk+á (7.3.33) da-y-á- 'donation, presenting'; dha-y-á- 'beaving',

By 35 below this initial increment is generally inserted at the head of an árdhadhatuka affix beginning with all consonants excluding the semivowel y-". The present rule is a prior exception to that and blocks this insertion. Such verbal stems are I 906-9,912; 946-1014; II 1-7; 31-57,59; III I-13; IV 26-40,57-91; V 1-17; VI 1-6; 109-42; VII 1-7,12-17; VIII 10; IX 1-9,29-36. There are, however, some exceptions which are dealt with in separate rules. Käsika and Siddhanta-Kaumudi provide special karika-s to enumerate these for ease of refer- ence. A few general rules may be specified here. Verbal stems end either in a vowel or a consonant. Of those ending in vowels, all except those ending in short a- are án-udatta and so on. 
púŇ pav-an-e IX 12 has the udátta accent and so we have á-pau-i-s-am in the Aorist (IUN) and páv-i-tum, but from DU-kr-N kár-an-e (VIII 10) which is ánudatta the corresponding forms are á-kar-e-am/kár-tum.

The verbal stems listed above, except for the cover term [vr] are all ánudatta while [ví-N, ví-N] are both udátta. In the former case the constraint is with reference to the nature of the stem (10) and with the latter to the affix (11). 1. kr+IT+vá/má = ca-kr-vá/má; 2. sa-st-vá/má; 3. ba-bhr-vá/má; 4. va-vr-vá-má; va-vr-váhe/máhe; 5. tu-stu-vá/má (4.61, 8.3.59); 6. du-dru-vá/má; 7. su-sru-vá/má; 8. su-sru-vá/má. 
The constraint here is limited only to K-IT l-substitutes with reference to the general rule 11 above. For the stems [stu-, dru-, sru-, śru-] the option provided by 63 below is also blocked by this prior exception.

The expressions 1. kṣub-dhá-, 2. svan-tá-, 3. dhvan-tá-, 4. lag-ná-, 5. mlis-tá-, 6. ví-rib-dhá-, 7. phan-tá- and 8. ba-dhá- are introduced [with affix Ktá 14, not co-occurring with initial increment 1.1.46 iT 8] to denote [respectively 1.3.10] 1. a mixed beverage or churning rod, 2. mind, 3. darkness, 4. attached, 5. indistinct, 6. tone, 7. made without effort and 8. strong, vehement. 
881 
In other senses the expressions are: 
ksubh-i-tá- 'stirred'; svan-i-tá- 'sounded', dhvan-i-tá- indicated, suggested', lag-i-tá- adhered', mlecch-i-tá- 'spoken wrongly or indistinctly', ví-rebh-i-ta- 'chattered', phan-i-tá- 'inspissated or con- densed juice of sugar-cane' and bah-i-tá- 'exerted'. 
The irregularly derived forms either constrain the meaning or undergo special modifications not regulated by rules framed: In the case of verbal stems mlech-, rebh- the stem vowels are shortened (by 1.1.48); in the case of lag-, Ktá-Kná. 
7.2.19 'dhŕsi-'sás-I vaíyat-y-e 
[The initial increment 1.1.46 iT is not inserted 8 at the head of nistha 14. affixes 3.1.1 introduced after 3.1.2 the verbal ánga-s 6.4.1] dhfs- 'dare' (V 22) and sás- 'hurt, injure' (I 763) to denote insolence (vaí-yat-y-e).

2. vi-sas+Ktá- vi-sas-tá- 'rude, ill-mannered' but ví-sas-i-ta- 'cut up, dissected'. This stem is also introduced with marker U as IT: éás-U himed-y-am and by 56 below and 15 above both forms are realized, but the present rule delimits their 
use in specific senses. 
7.2.20 dr-dhá-h 'sthu-lá-'bál-ay-oḥ 
The expression dr-dhá- is introduced [without initial increment iT 8 in- serted at the head of affix 3.1.1 Ktá 14, introduced after 3.1.2 the verbal ánga 6.4.1 dfmh- 'grow' (I 770)] to denote 'stout' (sthü-lá-) and 'strong' (°-bálay-oh).

The ir- regular derivative cited in this rule presupposes a replacement of phonemes /nh/ in the first stem and of /h/ in the second and substitute (dh] replacing [t] of the affix. The derivation shown above becomes defective in deriving further derivatives of [dr-dhá-] on account of the governing rule 8.2.1 in dr-dhá+imánic (5.1.123) dra-dh-imán- by 6.4.161 which stipulates the restriction that /ra/ replaces // preceded by a consonant only when it is a light syllable, but by metarule 8.2.1 drdh+dhá dr0-dha- by 8.3.13 does not fulfil the conditions laid down by 6.4.61, and /ra/ replacement of [r] is blocked. Hence the need for spe- cial introduction of the finished form without subjecting it to normal derivation.

7.2.21 pra-bh-aú pari-vr-dhá-ḥ

There is some hesitation regarding the nature of the final vowel in the substitute morphemes: whether it is a part of the morpheme or is used for ease of pronun- ciation. [dhau-] indicates the first option. On the other hand [pib-a] poses the difficulty of non-application of 86 below in [píb-a-ti]. A special metarule of ex- egesists provides for this situation or an alternate suggestion in the case of the first option above is to provide for udátta accent on the first syllable. In the case of the first option 6.1.97 provides for the correct surface forms: (I 974-77): 1. pa+SaP+tip píb-a-ti; 2. ghra: jíghr-a-ti; 3. dhma: dhám-ati; 4. stha: tisth-a-ti; 5. mna: mán-a-ti; 6. daN: yácch-a-ti; 7. dfs- (I 1017): pásy-a-ti; 8. r (I 983, III 17): fech-a-ti; 9. sr- (I 983, III 17): dháv-a-ti; 10. sad- (I 908, VI 134): sfy-a-te; 11. sad- (I 907, VI 113): síd-a-ti/sT-dá-ti.

stands'; 5. 'thinks, meditates'; 6. 'gives'; 7. 'sees, perceives'; 8. 'goes, moves'; 9. 'runs'; in other meanings like 'flows': sár-a-ti; 10. 'falls'; 11. 'sits, settles down'. In view of affixes with marker Ś as it, pa ráks-an-e II 47 is not covered by this rule 
since replaces [SaP] and 1.1.63 blocks any operation relating to the ánga.

The interpretation of this rule requires some finesse. If [aC-ah] as qualifying [upa-sarg-át] is considered as an ablative, the substituendum for [t] is the initial of what follows the ablative (1.1.54), viz. [d]; in order to avoid this interpreters either take [aC-ah] as repeated, one in the ablative qualifying the preverb, the other in the genitive to indicate the substituendum which yields the correct result; or in the alternative consider the substitute as [tt] when by 1.1.55 it replaces the whole of the substituendum.

This is a governing rule (adhi-kar-á) and the expression 'of the padá' will recur in 
each subsequent rule of this section. 
8.1.17 pad-át

By inference these enclitics are replacements for the dual personal (first and second) pronominal stems, since in the following two sútras special substitutes are intro- duced for the plural and the singular. 
gráma-h vam/(yuvá-bhyam) di-ya-te 'a village is given to both of you'; jana-padá-h 
nau/(avá-bhyam) di-ya-te 'an inhabited region is given to both of us'.

[The expression [kastha-adi-bhyah] has been interpolated from a várttika in the original sútra by Käsika and Siddhanta Kaumudi. This class denotes adverbs ending in -m, and by another várttika introduces a replacement of this in composition.] 
There are two views regarding the interpretation of this rule. Most commentators take the rule as pointing to the formation of compounds and an exception to 6.1.223 for accentuation read with 2.1.72. On the other hand Katyayaná and Patanjali indicate that the adverbial forms (kästha-m] etc. have the sUP triplet [am] replaced by in this collocation.

kastha-m adhy-ay-aka-h kasth-á-dhy-ay-aka-h 'an excellent scholar'; similarly

ring from 18 above is to block out the privative particle (ná].

A preceding vocative (púrva-m á-mantr-i-ta-m) is considered as though non-existent (á-vid-ya-mana-vat). 
This has an application pertaining to: 1. the accentuation of the following padá 
(19,28) and 2. enclitic replacements of [yusmád-, asmád-] (20-23). 
1. déva-dat-ta yájña-dat-ta- (contra 19), déva-dat-ta! pác-a-si? 'D., are you.

The bracketed words (in the plural number: bahu-vac-an-é) are provided by Patanjali who divides the rules 73-74 as given in the Kasika version which in- cludes Patanjali's insertion of [bahu-vac-ana-m] in the rule. The original reading appears to be: 73: [ná-ámantrite samanádhikar-ane] and 74: [samanya-vacanám víbhasitam visesa-vacané] whence Kasikā reads 74 as [vibhāṣitam visesa-vacane bahu-vac-aná-m]. Patañjali implies that the optionality applies only to the plural, while in the singular this rule does not apply.

Its inclusion here is to block out this particular character so as to establish its homogeneity with other al- lophones of this phoneme.
