In Pāṇini We Trust: Discovering the Algorithm for Rule Conflict Resolution in the Aṣṭādhyāyī -Rishi Rajpopat 

### Abstract 

If two rules are simultaneously applicable at a given step in a Pāṇinian derivation, which of the  two should be applied? Put differently, in the event of a ‘conflict’ between the two rules, which  rule wins?  

In the Aṣṭādhyāyī, Pāṇini has taught only one metarule, namely, 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam, to address this problem. Traditional scholars interpret it as follows: ‘in the event of a  conflict between two rules of equal strength, the rule that comes later in the serial order of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī, wins.’ 

Pāṇinīyas claim that if one rule is nitya, and its simultaneously applicable counterpart is anitya, or if one is antaraṅga and the other bahiraṅga, or if one is an apavāda (exception) and the  other the utsarga (general rule), then the two rules are not equally strong and consequently, we  cannot use 1.4.2 to resolve the conflict between them. The nitya, antaraṅga and apavāda rules  are stronger than their respective counterparts and thus win against them.  

But this system of conflict resolution is far from perfect: the tradition has had to write numerous additional metarules to account for umpteen exceptions. In this thesis, I propose my own  solution to the problem of rule conflict which I have developed by relying exclusively on  Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī. I replace the aforementioned traditional categories of rule conflict with a  new classification, based on whether the two rules are applicable to the same operand (Same  Operand Interaction, SOI), or to two different operands (Different Operand Interaction, DOI).  

I argue that, in case of SOI, the more specific i.e., the ‘exception’ rule, wins. Additionally, I develop a systematic method for the identification of the ‘more specific’ rule – based on  Pāṇini’s style of rule composition. I also argue that, in order to deal with DOI, Pāṇini has  composed 1.4.2, which I interpret as follows: ‘in case of DOI (vipratiṣedha), the right-hand  side (para) operation (kārya) prevails.’ I support my conclusions with both textual and  derivational evidence.  

I also discuss my interpretation of certain metarules teaching substitution and augmentation, the concept of aṅga, and the asiddha and asiddhavat rules and expound on not only their  interaction with 1.4.2 but also their influence on the overall functioning of the Pāṇinian  machine.

I want to thank the late Ms. Ranjana Deshpande who, through her enriching and effortless  pedagogy, lit the spark of Sanskrit in me during my high school years. Secondly, I wish to  express my gratitude towards my Guru, Ms. Geeta Gandhi, who initiated me into the  delightful world of Pāṇinian grammar and who, with her wealth of expertise and experience, continues to motivate and inspire me to this day. I am very grateful to Dr. James Benson who  supervised my Masters at the University of Oxford, and whose in-depth, almost spellbinding,  knowledge of the Aṣṭādhyāyī afforded me the opportunity to improve my understanding of its  infrastructure. 

I am most grateful to my supervisor, Dr. Vincenzo Vergiani, whose enlightening insights into  the evolution of the Indian grammatical tradition helped me develop and articulate my thoughts in a cogent manner. I think it would be no exaggeration to say that, were it not for his  perceptiveness, knowledge, wisdom, open-mindedness, magnanimity and liberal attitude, it  would have been absolutely impossible for me to produce this thesis. Right from mentoring  and encouraging me, to having faith in my abilities, to challenging and criticizing me, Dr.  Vergiani did everything that was necessary for me to thrive and flourish at Cambridge. Given  that he has single-handedly overlooked my growth as a researcher for the last four years, he  deserves no less than a lion’s share of credit for this thesis. 

I wish to offer special thanks to Dr. Maria Piera Candotti (University of Pisa), whose  remarkable familiarity with both traditional and modern argumentation on a variety of  derivational issues opened my eyes to multiple new perspectives towards the Aṣṭādhyāyī. I  want to wholeheartedly thank Dr. Balram Shukla (University of Delhi) who, through his  striking knowledge and perspicacity, enabled me to truly appreciate the role of the tradition in  preserving and decoding the Aṣṭādhyāyī. I owe a significant debt of gratitude to Dr. Tanuja  Ajotikar (Assistant Professor, The Sanskrit Library) – who has been nothing short of a living  encyclopaedia on all things Pāṇinian – for helping me appreciate the nuances of traditional  opinions on a wide range of derivational topics. I also want to sincerely thank Prof. Diwakar  Acharya (University of Oxford) and Dr. John Lowe (University of Oxford) for their thoughtful advice on important academic matters.  

I am extremely grateful to faculty members, fellow students and colleagues in Indology and  other fields, with whom I had many opportunities to have stimulating conversations which  facilitated my learning and maturation. I am privileged to enjoy, and very grateful for, the [[6]] unwavering affection and solidarity of my family and friends. Above all, I remain perennially indebted to Bhagavān who has blessed me with the curiosity and enthusiasm that drove this doctoral investigation to fruitful completion.

Chapter One 

### 1.1 Introduction to the Aṣṭādhyāyī 

Pāṇini1 composed the Aṣṭādhyāyī around 350 BC2 in North-Western South Asia.3 The  Aṣṭādhyāyī is a samāhāra ‘collection’ of aṣṭa(n) ‘eight’ adhyāyas ‘books’, hence the name  Aṣṭa-adhyāy(a)-ī. Each book of the Aṣṭādhyāyī has four pādas ‘chapters’ that are made up of  sūtras ‘rules’. In all, the Aṣṭādhyāyī comprises about 4000 rules. The Aṣṭādhyāyī is a  comprehensive grammar of the Sanskrit language as known to its author Pāṇini. It stands out  for doing more than merely describing its object language: the Aṣṭādhyāyī is a full-fledged  machine which helps construct grammatically correct Sanskrit words and sentences through a  step-by-step derivation4 process. In the Aṣṭādhyāyī, Pāṇini does not give us a general  introduction to his work, nor does he discuss the theoretical principles that have been used to  construct his sūtras. He conveys whatever has to be said, through his sūtras alone. 

The first two books are mainly composed of saṁjñā sūtras ‘definition rules’ and paribhāṣā  sūtras ‘metarules’5. The remaining books mainly consist of vidhi sūtras ‘operational rules’.  Books three to five teach the addition of both inflectional and derivational affixes to bases.  Book three teaches the addition of various affixes to verbal roots and stems, and books four  and five teach the addition of different affixes to nominal stems. Books six, seven and eight  teach various morpho-phonological operations that should be performed on both bases and 

1 There are many disagreements about the dates, and what I mention here are the dates agreed upon by  much recent scholarship.  

2 Cardona 1976: 267-268. 

3 I say ‘composed’ and not ‘wrote’ because scholars disagree on whether he used the aid of writing to  create his grammar. In recent times, Vergiani (2020) has present strong arguments in favour of the  proposition that Pāṇini did use written means to put together his magnum opus. Writing or not, it is  known that, just as happened with the Vedas, the Aṣṭādhyāyī too was orally transmitted from one  generation to the next. 

4 In the modern literature on the Pāṇinian grammatical tradition, it is customary to use the verb ‘to  derive’ and its derivatives (e.g., derivation) to simply mean ‘to construct’. The verb ‘to derive’ is used  in the context of not only derivational but also inflectional morphology. I shall abide by this convention  in this thesis. 

5 Metarules teach us how rules should be interpreted, how certain operations should be undertaken, and  how rules interact with one another.

affixes. Different kinds of rules from multiple books are required to derive a word using  Pāṇini’s method. 

To truly understand the Aṣṭādhyāyī, one needs to familiarize oneself with the methodology  used by Pāṇini to compose and arrange rules in his work. Pāṇini’s style is not entirely self evident, and one faces challenges at multiple levels when attempting to unravel the enigma that  is the Aṣṭādhyāyī. Firstly, it is not easy to determine the exact meanings of Pāṇini’s rules  because the sūtra style in which they are composed is very concise and compact. Much  information is often packed into a few words, thereby making it considerably difficult to  comprehend their exact purport. Consider 6.1.9 sanyaṅoḥ, which teaches that a verbal base6,  which has not undergone reduplication, undergoes reduplication in the presence of affixes saN7 and yaṄ, the desiderative and intensive markers, respectively.8 The question about whether  sanyaṅoḥ is a genitive dual or a locative dual is a crucial one, and has important implications  for how we conceptualize prakriyā ‘the (derivational) procedure’.9 

Secondly, to make sense of any given rule, it is essential to take into account the contents of  preceding rules. This is because Pāṇini uses a device called anuvr̥tti ‘continuation into the  following rules’ to economically express his observations: to understand the complete and  correct meaning of a rule, certain words from preceding sūtras may need to be borrowed into  that rule by anuvr̥tti. But there is no universal convention as to which terms are supposed to or  can become anuvr̥tta ‘continued’ into a certain rule. For example, consider 1.1.33  prathamacaramatayālpārdhakatipayanemāś ca, which teaches that certain words are called  sarvanāma. But it is difficult to determine whether or not the words from the previous rule  1.1.32 vibhāṣā jasi should be continued into this rule. If they are continued into 1.1.33, then  

6 Note that the whole base does not undergo reduplication. Instead, only one syllable does. See 6.1.1  ekāco dve prathamasya and 6.1.2 ajāder dvitīyasya. 

7 In this thesis, I use capital letters in Pāṇinian morphemes to represent itsaṁjñakas (taught in 1.3.2  upadeśe’j anunāsika it and following sūtras). Such its (commonly called anubandhas in post-Pāṇinian  grammatical literature) are used to mark certain properties of the item to which they are added, and are  not actually part of the item. Their unconditional deletion is taught by 1.3.9 tasya lopaḥ. 

8 Note that, in this thesis, I have used English translations of Pāṇini’s rules by Sharma (1987-2003) and  Katre (1987), for many but not all rules. I have taken the liberty to edit their translations as required.  For the remaining rules, I have presented my own translations.  

9 Cardona 1997: xvii, Kiparsky 1982: 85-86.

this would restrict 1.1.33 only to those cases where these stems are followed by the nominative  plural affix Jas, and would also make 1.1.33 optional.10 

Thirdly, even after the meaning of the rule has been understood, it does not become patently  obvious how to use it. This is because Pāṇini’s rules are placed together on the basis of topical  and functional categories, and not according to the derivations in which they participate.11 Thus, one cannot easily ascertain the order in which rules apply or select the step at which they  become applicable. For example, consider the rule 3.1.33 syatāsī lr̥luṭoḥ, which teaches that  the affixes sya and tāsI should be added to the left of LR̥ (LR̥Ṭ and LR̥Ṅ) and LUṬ respectively.  But the question that has troubled both traditional and modern scholars is: should and can this  rule apply before the lakāras are replaced with finite verb endings (3.4.77 lasya; 3.4.78 tip-tas jhi…12)?13 

Fourthly, after one has come to a conclusion about where to apply a given rule, one is often  faced with situations in which two rules become applicable at the same step. In many such  cases, one rule blocks the other, or both rules block each other. This is called ‘rule conflict’.  According to the tradition, a metarule taught by Pāṇini, namely 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ 

kāryam addresses this issue. However, it seems unable to give the right answer when applied  to certain cases of conflict. 

We can conclude that the Aṣṭādhyāyī is a very sophisticated grammar, and that to operate its  grammatical machine, we have to understand it at multiple levels. What would an early  grammarian or linguist have done in order to interpret the Aṣṭādhyāyī independently? With  negligible access to any commentary on the text, and with limited or no guidance of a teacher  well-versed in the Aṣṭādhyāyī, a scholar would have taken notes for himself in order to  comprehend, analyse and corroborate the teachings of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. He would have started  by paraphrasing the contents of the Aṣṭādhyāyī to establish what they exactly mean, both  independently and in the context of the preceding rules.  

10 Bloomfield 1927: 61-70.  

11 Besides, it is not possible to arrange rules on the basis of the derivations in which they participate  because most rules participate in umpteen different derivations.

10To ensure that he had understood such a complex grammar correctly, or to confirm that the  grammar accurately describes the structure of the language, a scholar would have tried to verify  the validity and accuracy of different rules against spoken language or attested literature. He would have gradually developed his own ideas about where rules should apply, and how  derivations should proceed. He would have noticed how rules interact amongst themselves and  would have come up with ways to classify and deal with such interactions. He would also have  suggested certain changes to these rules to make them more precise, to help them better  characterize their object language and/or to help them function more consistently with other  rules within the Pāṇinian system. 

This is presumably what happened in the Indian grammatical tradition when Kātyāyana  understood the meanings and functions of Pāṇinian rules on the basis of his independent study  of the Aṣṭādhyāyī.14 Then as a teacher, he also taught them to his pupils using his notes on the Aṣṭādhyāyī as pedagogical aid. His students taught the Aṣṭādhyāyī to their students using  Kātyāyana’s work and also commented on Kātyāyana’s writings, thereby sharing their own  opinions, interpretations and analyses with their students and readers. Successive generations  participated in this process of knowledge processing, production and transmission, thereby  giving birth to the Pāṇinian grammatical tradition.  

The texts of the Pāṇinian grammatical tradition have played a dominant role in influencing and  shaping our understanding of, and opinions about the Aṣṭādhyāyī. They also give us significant  insights into the evolution of different ideas in the Pāṇinian tradition. Below I introduce the  texts that I shall refer to in the rest of the thesis and briefly discuss the history of the Pāṇinian  tradition with special reference to metarules. 

### 1.2 Metarules in the Pāṇinian Grammatical Tradition 

Early grammatical thought in the Indian subcontinent, as represented by the works called  Prātiśākhyas, was intended to assist the recitation of Vedas by explaining the pronunciation of  accents and dissolution of sandhis. Their objective was merely descriptive, that is, to make  grammatical observations and offer clarifications where necessary. But a number of  

14 I think that there was a break in the transmission of the Aṣṭādhyāyī between Pāṇini and Kātyāyana,  since Kātyāyana seems to be in the process of understanding the Aṣṭādhyāyī without much help from  anyone else. I shall furnish evidence to support this statement in chapter 6.

11 

independent and full-fledged grammars emerged subsequently which sought to ‘derive’  language rather than simply ‘describe’ it: they built mechanistic systems which perform various  operations on bases and affixes in order to produce correct word forms and, using these fully  derived words, to construct meaningful sentences.  

While Pāṇini himself mentions many of his predecessors in his sūtras, his work, the  Aṣṭādhyāyī, remains the oldest surviving derivational grammar of Sanskrit. Composing such a  grammar required Pāṇini to meticulously design every aspect of the derivational procedure,  which explains why Pāṇini made significant efforts in formulating his paribhāṣā sūtras  ‘metarules’. These metarules play a pivotal role in the correct interpretation and application of  vidhi sūtras ‘operation rules’ at every step of the derivation, thereby ensuring that the  derivational machine produces the grammatically correct output. 

Given the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s remarkable exhaustiveness and accuracy, it is not surprising that  Kātyāyana, around 250 BC15, undertook a systematic analysis of what must have been for him  an unprecedented and extraordinary treatise. Kātyāyana recorded his thoughts and findings in  the form of vārttikas, which are short statements seeking to explain, examine, criticize and  sometimes integrate Pāṇini’s rules with additions. Without overlooking the more specific and  individual aspects of the grammar, Kātyāyana sought to develop a broad perspective about the  functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī as an integrated machine. This involved interpreting the  metarules of Pāṇini’s grammar, providing examples and counterexamples to determine their  verity, and composing new metarules to help the Pāṇinian system run even more smoothly. 

Around 150 BC, Patañjali wrote the Mahābhāṣya, which is a commentary on Kātyāyana’s  vārttikas.16 It records the arguments and counter-arguments that must have transpired between  Patañjali and his pupils about the contents of the vārttikas. Patañjali too approached the  Aṣṭādhyāyī with his independent perspective about its derivational system, and skilfully wove  Kātyāyana’s vārttikas into his own presentation of the Pāṇinian machine. In doing so, he both  established his independent interpretation of Pāṇini’s and Kātyāyana’s metarules, and wrote  new metarules to afford us greater clarity to the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s derivational procedure.  

In the course of time, some Pāṇinīyastook it upon themselves to compile and comment on all  such metarules from Patañjali’s Mahābhāṣya. They also came up with new metarules to fill the  

15 Cardona 1976: 267-268. 

16 The two major commentaries on the Mahābhāṣya are the Pradīpa of Kaiyaṭa and the Uddyota of  Nāgeśa.

12 

knowledge gaps that they thought existed in the tradition. They came to be known as  paribhāṣākāras ‘authors of paribhāṣās’, and the literature composed by them, as paribhāṣā literature. Paribhāṣā texts have been written over many centuries – from around17 (or soon  after) Patañjali’s time, if not before him, to the 18th century. Among the paribhāṣā texts of the  Pāṇinian tradition, the most popularly studied, quoted and commented upon in modern times  is the relatively recent Paribhāṣenduśekhara of Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa, which was written in the  eighteenth century.  

A rich tradition of paribhāṣā literature has long existed in other schools of Sanskrit grammar  too (e.g., Kātantra, Haima, Cāndra).18 Both Pāṇinian and non-Pāṇinian paribhāṣākāras were  especially interested in certain topics, for example, rule conflict. In Nāgeśa’s work, the section  containing paribhāṣās 38 to 70 deals exclusively with rule conflict and is thus called  bādhabīja.19 Similarly, in the Kātantra system, paribhāṣā sūtras are actually divided into  balābala sūtras ‘metarules dealing with comparison of rule strength’ and others which do not  deal with this topic.20 A significant exchange of ideas took place between Pāṇinian and non Pāṇinian traditions due to mutual borrowing of paribhāṣās. 

Circa 7th century AD, Jayāditya and Vāmana wrote the Kāśikā, which consists of vr̥ttis on each  rule.21 A vr̥tti paraphrases the rule, teaches metarules that help us correctly apply that rule,  gives examples of its application, and justifies the existence of each word of that rule. Vr̥ttis  borrow a significant proportion of their contents from Patañjali’s Mahābhāṣya. They are unique  in that they do not comprise new metarules, yet by quoting some metarules from Patañjali’s  Mahābhāṣya and ignoring others, they present an evolved perspective about the mechanistic  aspects of Pāṇinian derivations – often quite different from Patañjali’s. 

Lastly, let us talk about kaumudī texts, which explicitly envision the Aṣṭādhyāyī as a  grammatical machine. The kaumudī tradition which began in the fifteenth century with  

17 Abhyankar 1967: 12. 

18 K.V. Abhyankar has edited and compiled many Pāṇinian and non-Pāṇinian paribhāṣā treatises in his  Paribhāṣāsaṁgraha (1967).

21 The two major commentaries on the Kāśikā are the Nyāsa of Jinendrabuddhi and the Padamañjarī of Haradatta.

13 

Rāmacandra’s Prakriyākaumudī22, reorders the sūtras of the Aṣṭādhyāyī to reflect their  derivational roles: in any Kaumudī text, a rule is introduced when the first derivation involving  it is taught. The Kaumudī texts first introduce saṁjñā and paribhāṣā rules, then teach sandhi rules, then introduce nominal and verbal inflections in the order in which forms appear in  paradigms, and then teach derivatives and compounds. The most celebrated text in this genre  is Bhaṭṭojī Dīkṣita’s Siddhāntakaumudī written in the seventeenth century.23 By reordering the  Aṣṭādhyāyī’s rules, the Kaumudī not only gives us a glimpse of how Pāṇini’s derivational  mechanism actually works, but also tells us which metarules apply where, and how these  metarules enable the us to perform derivations uniformly. 

Even though the traditional texts discussed above broadly agree on most derivational  technicalities, they present different perspectives on the nature and characteristics of the  machine.  

### 1.3 Modern Perspectives on the Functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī 

Before we explore how modern scholarship perceives the Aṣṭādhyāyī, let us very briefly  consider what the tradition, and more specifically Kātyāyana and Patañjali say, about the meaning and purpose of vyākaraṇa. In vt. 14 of the Paspaśāhnika24, Kātyāyana says:  lakṣyalakṣaṇe vyākaraṇam ‘grammar (stands for the combination of) lakṣya i.e., words (and  sentences)’ and lakṣaṇa ‘rules’. This is true of any grammar, not just the Aṣṭādhyāyī. But does  the Aṣṭādhyāyī have certain mechanistic properties which set it apart from conventional  grammars? Below we will look at modern perspectives on this topic. According to Patañjali25,  vyākaraṇa serves the following purposes: rakṣohāgamalaghvasandehāḥ “rakṣā ‘protection of  the Vedas’, ūha ‘adapting inflected forms in Vedic mantras as required during rituals’, āgama 

22 The earliest reordered commentary was the Rūpāvatāra of Dharmakīrti (10th century), but its  influence on the later kaumudī literature is uncertain.  

23 It is accompanied by Bhaṭṭojī’s auto-commentary on the Siddhāntakaumudī called  Prauḍhamanoramā. Two commentaries on the Siddhāntakaumudī are widely used to study it, namely  Vāsudeva Dīkṣita’s elaborate and beginner (lit. bāla ‘child’) -friendly Bālamanoramā, and Jñānendra Sarasvatī’s concise and advanced Tattvabodhinī (Cardona 1976: 285-286).

‘following Vedic injunctions’, laghu ‘brevity i.e., easy of learning the language’, and asandeha ‘resolution of doubts’”. These certainly are some of the factors that must have motivated Pāṇini  to write his grammar. But was Pāṇini also aiming to build a somewhat mechanistic model for  deriving Sanskrit words (and subsequently, sentences)? Let us look at what modern scholarship  tells us about topics like rule conflict and order of rule application in Pāṇinian derivations, and  therefore, about the status of the Aṣṭādhyāyī as a ‘machine’. 

Let us start by looking at Bronkhorst’s work on this topic. Bronkhorst (2004) shows that  Patañjali prefers a linear reading of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, that is, Patañjali believes that in order to  decide which rule should apply at any step in a derivation, one need not know the outcomes of  previous or following steps. He says, “It is clear from the above that Patañjali tries both to  avoid looking back and looking ahead in explaining grammatical derivations.”26 Bronkhorst  also points out that the Paribhāṣenduśekhara teaches the metarule  pūrvaparanityāntaraṅgāpavādānām uttarottaraṁ balīyaḥ (paribhāṣā 38) ‘Of [these five kinds  of rules, - viz.] a preceding [rule], a subsequent [rule]27, a nitya [rule]28, an antaraṅga [rule]29,  and an apavāda [rule]30, - each following [rule] possesses greater force [than any one of, or  all, the rules which in this paribhāṣā are mentioned before it].’31 He concludes: “…(this)32 clearly shows that, according to the traditional view, decisions concerning the continuation of  

26 Bronkhorst 2004: 37. 

27 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam ‘The rule that comes later in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī wins  the rule conflict between two equally powerful rules.’  

28 Let us say that there is a conflict between rules A and B. A is called nitya with respect to B if A is  applicable (both before and) after the application of B (cf. Pbh 117 kr̥tākr̥taprasaṅgī yo vidhiḥ sa nityaḥ,  Vyāḍiparibhāṣāpāṭha). B is called anitya with respect to A if B is applicable before, but not after the  application of A. The nitya rule A is stronger than, and defeats the anitya rule B. 

29Paribhāṣenduśekhara, describes antaraṅga as follows: antarmadhye  bahiraṅgaśāstrīyanimittasamudāyamadhye’ ntarbhūtāny aṅgāni nimittāni yasya tad antaraṅgam. Kielhorn translates it as follows: ‘antaraṅga is (a rule) the causes (of the application) of which lie within  (or before) the sum of the causes of a bahiraṅga rule’. See Abhyankar’s reprint (second edition) of  Kielhorn’s work (1960: 221-222). 

30 An apavāda ‘exception’ is stronger than, and thus defeats, the utsarga ‘general’ rule in case of  conflict.

a grammatical derivation at any particular point are taken on the basis of the situation at hand.  More specifically, no information about the earlier or later phases of the derivation is required  to make a correct decision at any stage.”33 

Bronkhorst states that he is unconvinced by Patañjali’s evidence suggesting that the Aṣṭādhyāyī functions linearly. He thinks that Pāṇini did not intend for the Aṣṭādhyāyī to be approached  linearly, and attempts to establish that at least for some derivations, the knowledge of the  derivation’s history and/or its future course is essential to select the right rule at a given step.34 

One of the reasons Bronkhorst thinks looking ahead into the derivation is required is to  determine the order in which two rules should apply with respect to each other.35 Roodbergen  has a different opinion on this subject. 36 He recommends some changes to the traditional order  in which the following processes occur: the replacement of lakāras ‘tense and mood proxies’  with tiṄ ‘verbal endings’ and the introduction of vikaraṇas ‘affixes placed between verbal roots  and lakāras/the endings that replace lakāras’. This shows that Roodbergen does believe in  reading the Aṣṭādhyāyī linearly but disagrees to some extent with the tradition’s order of rule  application. And he thinks that this topic is not related to rule conflict and its resolution: ‘this  ordering principle has nothing to do with a feeding relation between rules in which the  application of one rule is made dependent on the effect of the application of another rule. It has  nothing to do either, with the question of conflict of rules. To solve a conflict, other principles  apply: paratva, siddha/asiddha37 and utsarga/apavāda.’ 

33 Bronkhorst 2004: 6. Patañjali says that para may mean iṣṭa ‘desirable’ in his commentary on 1.4.1  (iṣṭavācī paraśabdaḥ. vipratiṣedhe paraṁ yad iṣṭaṁ tad bhavati; Mbh I.306.9-10). According to  Bronkhorst, by iṣṭa, Patañjali means ‘the rule that he thinks should be applied’. I disagree with  Bronkhorst’s interpretation. I think by iṣṭa, Patañjali means ‘the rule that should be applied so as to get  the correct final form.’ This means that, in order to determine which rule is iṣṭa, one is required to know  the final form. And to know the final form, one needs to look ahead into the derivation. So, in my  opinion, this is an instance where Patañjali repudiates his linear reading of the Aṣṭādhyāyī.

37 A is siddha with respect to B if B recognizes the existence of A. Likewise, A is asiddha ‘not siddha’  with respect to B if B does not recognize the existence of A.

Scholars working on rule conflict have peripherally addressed the topic of linearity. Cardona  says that ‘the derivational prehistory of a form is pertinent to the operations which apply to  it.’38 Joshi and Kiparsky think that it is important to look ahead into a derivation. They propose  the extended siddha principle which they claim governs Pāṇinian derivations and which ‘scans  entire candidate derivations…’39 thanks to its ‘global (trans-derivational) “lookahead”  condition on derivations’40 ‘…and chooses the one in which siddha-relations (bleeding and  feeding)41 are maximized’42. So, both Cardona and Joshi & Kiparsky, do not support an  exclusively linear reading of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. 

According to Houben43, ‘a comparison between Pāṇini’s grammar and “a machine” may be  useful in demonstrating some of the features and procedures it incorporates, but the comparison  has now and then been carried too far.’ He continues: ‘in fact, in the practice of Pāṇinīyas  through the ages up to the present, no-one can ever have produced a correct form through  Pāṇini’s system that was not already his starting point, or among his starting options … the  system is therefore not well characterized as “synthetic”, even if synthetic procedures are  central and most visible; rather the system is to be called “reconstitutive” - which implies the  presence of a user, a preliminary statement, and the application of both analytic and synthetic  procedures to the words in it … aiming at the best possible, saṁskr̥ta form of his preliminary  statement.’44 He attributes the reception of Pāṇinian grammar as a machine to Bhaṭṭojī Dīkṣita’s  Siddhāntakaumudī and Nāgeśa’s Paribhāṣenduśekhara: ‘in order to provide the desired solid  authoritative basis to Sanskrit grammar it was moreover necessary to posit it as a closed system  of rules and metarules – something it had never been in a true sense of this term for around two  millennia, although Kātyāyana's and Patañjali's investigations on selected sūtras had prepared

the ground for such an approach. The culmination in this trend came only a few generations  later with Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa's Paribhāṣenduśekhara…’45 

Let us summarize what we have surveyed so far. Houben is not in favour of perceiving the  Aṣṭādhyāyī as a derivational machine, thereby also implicitly dismissing both the concept of  linearity and consistent conflict-resolution procedures. Roodbergen believes that the  Aṣṭādhyāyī is a derivational machine, proposes his own version of a linear reading of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī. Roodbergen also argues that the order of rule application and resolution of rule  conflict are not related or associated with each other. Bronkhorst claims that the existence of  paribhāṣā 38 of the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, which creates a hierarchy of conflict resolution  tools (in addition to Patañjali’s statements), indicates that the tradition prefers a linear reading  of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. In doing so, Bronkhorst establishes a correlation between consistent rule  conflict resolution procedures and a linear reading of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. Bronkhorst rejects the  linear approach. On the other hand, Joshi & Kiparsky and Cardona seem to think that their  rejection of a strictly linear reading of the Aṣṭādhyāyī does not substantially undermine the  mechanistic prowess of the Pāṇinian system, and devote much of their scholarly attention to  solving rule conflict.  

While the functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī remains the primary focus of this thesis, we shall also  look at its interactions with the structure of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. Let me first outline how the  Aṣṭādhyāyī is structured. The rules of the Aṣṭādhyāyī are organized on the basis of their  purpose: rules teaching certain saṁjñās are grouped together, rules about a certain substitute 

are placed together and so on and so forth. In most such groups, the apavāda sūtras ‘exception  rules’ are listed immediately after the utsarga sūtras ‘general rules’. These groups of rules are  themselves placed in one of the eight books depending on their role: saṁjñā sūtras ‘definition  rules’ and paribhāṣā sutras ‘metarules’ are generally placed in the first two adhyāyas, rules  teaching affixation in the following three, and rules teaching morpho-phonological changes in  the last three.  

The structure and organization of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, that is, the general arrangement and serial  order of rules in the Aṣṭādhyāyī, have an influence on its functioning in different ways. In the  opinion of the tradition, 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam teaches that in the case of conflict  between two equally powerful rules, the rule that appears later in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial order  

45 Houben 2015: 6.

18 

wins, which implies that the serial order of rules in the Aṣṭādhyāyī has a direct impact on rule  conflict resolution.  

Pāṇini has ingeniously composed three asiddha sections, headed respectively by 6.1.86  ṣatvatukor asiddhaḥ46, 6.4.22 asiddhavad atrābhāt and 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham. 6.4.22 teaches  us that two rules treat each other as asiddhavat ‘as if suspended’ when both lie within 6.4.22- 12947, which helps avoid certain undesirable instances of rule conflict. 8.2.1 teaches us that  from there onwards, a preceding rule treats any following rule as asiddha ‘suspended’, which  helps facilitate or avoid the application of certain rules. Here too, the position of one rule with  respect to other rules has a significant impact on Pāṇinian derivations or the functioning of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī. 

Interestingly, the functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī may have had an impact on its structure too.  Roodbergen argues that ‘the word building process proceeds in what is visually a left-to-right  direction’.48 According to Roodbergen, this direction of word-building which underlies the  functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, impacts its structure, that is, the positioning of rules in different  books and chapters of the Aṣṭādhyāyī: ‘rules dealing with left-side elements are introduced  earlier [in earlier sections of the Aṣṭādhyāyī]49 than rules dealing with right-side elements’50. 

We have seen what the existing literature on the subject says about the functioning of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī and its connection with its structure. In this thesis, I share my research on rule  interaction, and then go on to show how these findings shed light on the functioning of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī. I conclude that Pāṇini did intend for the Aṣṭādhyāyī to be interpreted linearly and  as a closed grammatical machine. Before I share my understanding of rule interaction, let us  first look at the tradition’s views on this subject. 

46 A single replacement of the preceding and the following sounds is suspended (asiddha) with respect  to rules teaching replacement with ṣ (ṣatva) and the introduction of augment tUK. 47 According to the Kāśikā, and broadly, the tradition, the scope of 6.4.22 continues up to the end of  6.4. I will discuss this in detail in chapter 5.

### 1.4 The Traditional View on Rule Conflict 

As will be shown in chapter 6, the views of the tradition have gradually evolved on the topic  of rule conflict. But here, I shall introduce the topic by outlining those ideas on rule conflict  that today’s traditional scholars hold true. To achieve this, I will present the views of the Kāśikā and paribhāṣā texts on this topic. 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam is the only metarule in the  Aṣṭādhyāyī which explicitly deals with rule conflict. Here is Vasu’s English translation of the  rule 1.4.2 of the Aṣṭādhyāyī which is in keeping with the Kāśikā’s interpretation: ‘when rules  of equal force prohibit each other, then the last in the order herein given is to take effect.’ 

On this rule, the Kāśikā says: 

virodho vipratiṣedhaḥ. yatra dvau prasaṅgāv anyārthāv ekasmin yugapat prāpnutaḥ sa  tulyabalavirodho vipratiṣedhaḥ. tasmin vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryaṁ bhavati.  utsargāpavādanityānityāntaraṅgabahiraṅgeṣu tulyabalatā nāstīti nāyam asya yogasya  viṣayaḥ, balavataiva tatra bhavitavyam. apravṛttau paryāyeṇa vā pravṛttau prāptāyāṁ 

vacanam ārabhyate.  

Here is my translation of this passage, which represents the traditional interpretation of 1.4.2: 

‘The word vipratiṣedha means “conflict”. When two operations which can be applied at other  sites become simultaneously applicable at one [and the same site], this is called a conflict of  equal strength or vipratiṣedha. In the event of vipratiṣedha, the rule that comes later [in the  serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī] prevails.51 A general rule (utsarga) and its exception (apavāda),  or a nitya rule and an anitya rule, or an antaraṅga and a bahiraṅga rule, are not rules of equal  strength. These pairs do not fall under the jurisdiction of this rule. In these cases, the stronger  rule wins. When both rules are unable to apply, or when they are only able to apply  alternatively, this rule comes into play.’ 

Then the Kāśikā gives us an example: 

ato dīrgho yañi supi cety asyāvakāśaḥ. vṛkṣābhyāṁ plakṣābhyāṁ bahuvacane jhaly et ity  asyāvakāśaḥ vṛkṣeṣu plakṣeṣu ihobhayaṁ prāpnoti. vṛkṣebhyaḥ plakṣebhyaḥ iti. paraṁ bhavati vipratiṣedhena. 

This is explained by Vasu as follows: 

51 I have translated para kārya as understood by the tradition.

20‘As an example of rules of equal force, see 7.3.102 and 7.3.103. The first rule declares, when  a case-affix beginning with a letter of yaÑ pratyāhāra follows, the long vowel is substituted  for the final of an inflective base ending in a short a. As vr̥kṣa + bhyām = vr̥kṣābhyām. The  next rule declares:- When a plural case-affix beginning with a letter or [sic]52 jhaL pratyāhāra 

follows, e is the substitute for the final a of an inflective base. As vr̥kṣa + su = vr̥kṣeṣu. But  when the plural case-affix bhyasfollows, what rule are we to apply? For the letter53 bha belongs  both to pratyahāras yaÑ and jhaL. Are we to lengthen the short a or substitute e? The present  sūtra gives the reply, e is to be substituted because 7.3.103 ordaining e follows next to 7.3.102.  Thus vr̥kṣa + bhyaḥ = vr̥kṣebhyaḥ.’54 

The Kāśikā teaches us that when two conflicting rules are not of equal force, 1.4.2 is not  applicable to the conflict between them. The paribhāṣā tradition throws light on conflicts  between rules which are not of equal strength: 

a. Between a nitya and an anitya operation, a nitya rule is more powerful. Nityānityayor nityo vidhir balavān (Paribhāṣā 118, Vyāḍiparibhāṣāpāṭha).55 b. Between an antaraṅga and a bahiraṅga operation, an antaraṅga operation is more powerful. Antaraṅgabahiraṅgayor antaraṅgo vidhir balīyān (Paribhāṣā 115, Vyāḍiparibhāṣāpāṭha).56 c. Between an apavāda and an utsarga operation, an apavāda operation is more powerful. Utsargāpavādayor apavādavidhir balavān (Paribhāṣā 85, Bhojaparibhāṣāsūtra). 

The more powerful rule wins. The following paribhāṣā, which has been popularized by the  Paribhāṣenduśekhara, creates a hierarchy of importance between four tools of rule conflict  resolution namely paratva, nityatva, antaraṅgatva and apavādatva57: pūrva-para-nitya 

52 Of. 

53 Perhaps Vasu intended to say ‘sound’ and not ‘letter’. 

54 This example in the Kāśikā is borrowed from Mahābhāṣya on 1.4.2 (Mbh I.304.15). 55 Another version of this paribhāṣā is balavan nityam anityāt (92, Bhojaparibhāṣāsūtra). 56 Another version of this paribhāṣā is (balavad) antaraṅgaṁ bahiraṅgāt (93, Bhojaparibhāṣāsūtra),  where balavat is anuvr̥tta from the previous paribhāṣā. 

57 It is not clear why the word pūrva has been mentioned in the paribhāṣā. 

21 

antaraṅga-apavādānām uttarottaraṁ balīyaḥ (Pbh 38, Paribhāṣenduśekhara). We have  already mentioned this paribhāṣā before. Below I will clarify its implications. 

Paribhāṣā 38 of the Paribhāṣenduśekhara says that a para sūtra is stronger than a pūrva sūtra;  a nitya sūtra is stronger than a para sūtra; an antaraṅga sūtra is stronger than a nitya sūtra;  and an apavāda sūtra is stronger than an antaraṅga sūtra. In practical terms this translates into  the following procedure. 

First try establishing the relationship taught in step a: 

a. apavāda>utsarga: an apavāda (exception) sūtra is more powerful than, and wins when  competing with, an utsarga (general rule) sūtra. 

If and only if this step does not yield the correct result, try establishing the relationship taught  in step b:  

b. antaraṅga>bahiraṅga58: an antaraṅga sūtra is more powerful than, and wins when  competing with, a bahiraṅga sūtra. 

If and only if this step does not yield the correct result, try establishing the relationship taught  in step c:  

c. nitya>anitya: a nitya rule is more powerful than and wins when competing with an anitya rule. 

If and only if this step does not yield the correct result, apply 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam,  which we call step d here:  

d. para>pūrva: a para sūtra (a later rule in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial order) is more powerful  than, and wins when competing with, a pūrva sūtra (which appears before the para sūtra). 

58 Patañjali and Nāgeśa hold the antaraṅga paribhāṣā true for both conflict and other situations. See  the Mahābhāṣya on 1.4.2 (Mbh I.309.24 onwards) and paribhāṣā 50 of the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, asiddham bahiraṅgam antaraṅge.

22 

Traditional solution: rule conflict 

 unequal strength equal strength (vipratiṣedha)  stronger rule wins the para rule wins (1.4.2) 

### 1.5 Analysis of the Traditional Perspective 

Let us look at 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam again. Pāṇini does not explain the meaning of  vipratiṣedha in the Aṣṭādhyāyī. The Kāśikā claims that vipratiṣedha means tulyabalavirodha ‘conflict between two equally powerful rules.’ This is a plausible assumption because, in  Sanskrit literature, the term has been used to mean ‘the opposition of two courses of action  which are equally important, the conflict of two even-matched interests’59. But which conflicts  qualify as tulyabala ‘having equal strength’? The Kāśikā says that rule pairs which are not  nitya-anitya, antaraṅga-bahiraṅga, apavāda-utsarga are tulyabala ‘having equal strength’.  

Let us try to understand why the tradition felt the need to come up with these tools. According  to the tradition, para in 1.4.2 means ‘the rule that appears after another in the serial order of  the Aṣṭādhyāyī’. Thus, in the case of a conflict (vipratiṣedha) between two rules, the operation  prescribed by the later rule should prevail. However, if one assumes that any rule conflict can  be called vipratiṣedha, and therefore applies 1.4.2 uniformly to every instance of such a  conflict, in many cases one gets the wrong answer at the end of the derivation. Let us consider  a few examples: tud is a 6th class root which can take both parasmaipada ‘active’ and ātmanepada ‘middle’ endings.  

When deriving its present third person singular form, two rules become applicable at the step  tud + tiP. One is 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca (sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ guṇaḥ)60,  which teaches that the penultimate light vowel iK (i, u, r̥, l̥) is replaced with guṇa (a, e, o) when  followed by a sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix. The other is 3.1.77 tudādibhyaḥ śaḥ 

(sārvadhātuke kartari), which teaches the addition of affix Śa after roots belonging to the class  starting with tud in the Dhātupāṭha, when the root is followed by a sārvadhātuka affix in an  

59 See the entry on vipratiṣedha in Apte’s Sanskrit dictionary.  

60 The terms in brackets are anuvr̥tta ‘continued’ from previous sūtras. 

23 

active construction. Note that, since 7.3.86 comes after 3.1.77 in the serial order of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī, according to the traditional understanding of 1.4.2 it should win, but applying  7.3.86 would give the wrong answer: tod + tiP (7.3.86) 🡪 tod + Śa + tiP (3.1.77) 🡪 *todati.  

Notice that 3.1.77 is applicable after 7.3.86 applies, as seen in the derivation above. On the  other hand, if 3.1.77 applies first, we get: tud + Śa + tiP. Since Śa is marked with a Ś, it is  sārvadhātuka by 3.4.113 tiṅśit sārvadhātukam, and being a sārvadhātuka which is not marked  with a P, it is treated as if marked by Ṅ by 1.2.4 sārvadhātukam apit (ṅit). By 1.1.5 kṅiti ca (na  iko guṇavr̥ddhī), the guṇa replacement of u in tud by 7.3.86 is no longer possible. So 7.3.86 is  not applicable once 3.1.77 has applied.  

Thus, 3.1.77 and 7.3.86 are nitya and anitya respectively. If the nitya rule, i.e., 3.1.77 wins, we  get: tud + Śa + tiP (3.1.77) 🡪 tudati, which is the correct answer. In this example, relying on  paratva gives the wrong answer, but using nityatva gives the right answer. We shall come back  to this after we look at a few more examples.  

Consider the next example: to derive syona ‘a sack, something stitched’, na is added to siv ‘to  sew, stitch’: siv + na (3.3.1 uṇādayo bahulam).61 First, by 6.4.1962 chvoḥ śūḍ anunāsike ca  (kvijhaloḥ kṅiti), v of siv is replaced with ū: (siū) + na. Now, two rules are simultaneously  applicable here: 6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci, which is caused by ū and prescribes the replacement of i  with y, and 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca, which is caused by na and prescribes the  replacement of i of si with its corresponding guṇa (i.e., e). Since 7.3.86 comes after 6.1.77 in  the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, by 1.4.2 it should win. But applying 7.3.86 gives us the  wrong answer. 

According to the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, ‘antaraṅga is (a rule) the causes (of the application)  of which lie within (or before) the sum of the causes of a bahiraṅga rule’. So, in the case of siū  + na, ū, the cause of 6.1.77, lies before (i.e., to the left of) na, the cause of 7.3.86. Thus, 6.1.77  

61 This is one of only two sūtras that refer to an ancillary text known as Uṇādisūtras, which provide for  introducing certain affixes after verb roots to derive nominal bases (Cardona 1976: 170). There is no  clear consensus about whether or not Pāṇini himself wrote the Uṇādisūtras (Cardona 1976: 174). I  personally do not think he did, and so I do not consider this derivation ‘Pāṇinīya’. But because the  commentarial tradition uses this as an example in the present context, I discuss it nonetheless. The  relevant Uṇādi sūtra here is 289 siveṣ ṭer yū ca. 

62 I am aware that the tradition reads this rule as cchvoḥ… and not as chvoḥ…. However, I think that  the original version must have been chvoḥ. See Kiparsky 1982: 89.

24 

is antaraṅga whereas 7.3.86 is bahiraṅga. Using the antaraṅgatva tool, 6.1.77 wins. We get  syū + na 🡪 syo + na (sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ) 🡪 syona, which is the correct answer.  Relying on paratva gives the wrong answer, while using antaraṅgatva gives the right answer.  

Let us look at one more example. Two rules, namely 1.4.16 siti ca (padam) and 1.4.18 yaci  bham (svādiṣv asarvanāmasthāne) lie in the ekā saṁjñā section (1.4.1 ā kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā). 1.4.1 teaches that up to 2.2.38 kaḍārāḥ karmadhāraye, any item can take only one saṁjñā ‘technical designation’. 1.4.16 siti ca (padam) teaches that an item is called pada when an affix  marked with S follows, and 1.4.18 yaci bham (svādiṣv asarvanāmasthāne) teaches that an item  is called bha when a y- or vowel-initial, non-sarvanāmasthāna affix belonging to the class  starting with sU follows. Consider the example ūrṇā + yuS.63 Here ūrṇā can potentially take  two saṁjñās: pada by 1.4.16 and bha by 1.4.18. However, since both rules lie within the  jurisdiction of 1.4.1, ūrṇā can take only one of the two saṁjñās. By 1.4.2, the para rule i.e., 1.4.18 should win. But if ūrṇā takes the bha saṁjñā, then ā of ūrṇā gets deleted by 6.4.148  yasyeti ca (bhasya lopaḥ taddhite), which teaches that the final i or a (both short and long) of  an item which is termed bha are deleted when followed by an ī or a taddhita affix. This gives  us the wrong taddhita stem *ūrṇyu. The Kāśikā says that 1.4.16 is an apavāda of 1.4.18 without  justifying this claim.64 If the apavādatva tool is used, 1.4.16 wins, which gives the correct stem  ūrṇāyu. Using paratva gives the wrong answer, while using apavādatva gives the right answer.  

In all three examples discussed above, using paratva gives the wrong answer, but using  nityatva, antaraṅgatva and apavādatva respectively leads to the correct answer. Below, I  present an abridged version of how I think the current method of solving rule conflict has  gradually evolved. Having realized that treating all rule conflicts as vipratiṣedha and applying  

63 5.2.123 ūrṇāyā yus ‘The taddhita suffix yuS occurs to denote the sense of matUP after syntactically  related nominal stem ūrṇā “wool”’. 

64 I agree with Cardona’s (1970: 46) explanation for this: “Consider now 1.4.16. There are only four  affixes marked with S in Pāṇini’s grammar: ghaS (🡪 iya by 7.1.2) introduced by 5.1.106, chaS (🡪 īya,  7.1.2) by 4.2.114-5, yaS (ya) by 5.2.138, and yuS (🡪 aka, 7.1.1) by 5.2.123, 138, 140. For example,  r̥tviya- ‘tempestivus’ (<r̥tu ‘appropriate time, season’) contains ghaS. All such affixes are taddhita 

(4.1.76: taddhitāḥ), included among the affixes referred to in 1.4.17-8, and all also begin with y or a  vowel. Hence, items occurring before these are eligible for being bha by 1.4.18.” With the help of this  information, we can infer that 1.4.18 is applicable wherever 1.4.16 is applicable, but 1.4.16 is not always  applicable where 1.4.18 is. 1.4.16 is more specific than 1.4.18 and thus wins.

25 

1.4.2 uniformly to every instance of such a conflict gives the wrong answer in many cases, the  Pāṇinīyas: 

(1) claimed that they found jñāpakas ‘hints or clues’ in Pāṇini’s sūtras which authorised them  to devise new tools like nityatva, antaraṅgatva, anavakāśatva, etc., for the purpose of solving  rule conflicts; 

(2) restricted the jurisdiction of rule 1.4.2 by declaring that vipratiṣedha implies only tulyabala conflicts, i.e., conflicts between equally powerful rules; and 

(3) declared that rule pairs like nitya-anitya, antaraṅga-bahiraṅga, and anavakāśa-sāvakāśa were to be called atulyabala ‘not equally powerful’. 

This allowed them to exclude the atulyabala rule pairs, namely nitya-anitya, antaraṅga bahiraṅga etc., from the jurisdiction of 1.4.2, thereby containing the problems caused by their  interpretation of 1.4.2 to a smaller number of cases. Gradually, the Pāṇinīyas also constructed  the hierarchy taught in paribhāṣā 38 of Paribhāṣenduśekhara above to determine which tool  takes precedence over which other tools. 

However, these post-Pāṇinian tools are not without flaws, to compensate for which umpteen  other paribhāṣās have been written by Pāṇinīyas. Many of these paribhāṣās address very  specific cases65 or even single examples of conflict, thereby defeating the entire purpose of  writing metarules, which is to arrive at broad generalizations that can govern the application of  and interactions between the whole body of rules. And even after this, the Pāṇinīyas are not  able to solve every case of conflict correctly: every time they falter, they find one tortuous  explanation or the other to justify that ‘exception’. 

I do not think that all paribhāṣās taught by the Pāṇinīyas should be rejected. Many post Pāṇinian paribhāṣās accurately capture how the Pāṇinian machine functions, and thus they are  of great importance to us. They are mostly descriptive in nature and make insightful  observations about the Aṣṭādhyāyī. However, we also find post-Pāṇinian paribhāṣās that teach  us tools for rule conflict resolution, such as nityatva and antaraṅgatva, which Pāṇini would  

65 For example, consider Pbh 52 of the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, antaraṅgān api vidhīn bahiraṅgo lug bādhate ‘A bahiraṅga rule teaching LUK deletion defeats an antaraṅga rule [in case of conflict]’, which  is an exception of Pbh 50 antaraṅge bahiraṅgam asiddham ‘An antaraṅga rule treats a bahiraṅga rule  as suspended.’

26 

certainly not have left unstated if he actually wanted to teach them, and which impose post Pāṇinian ideas onto the Aṣṭādhyāyī. Thus, the validity of this set of paribhāṣās is questionable. 

### 1.6 Modern Scholarship on 1.4.2 

The tradition thinks that 1.4.2 applies to tulyabala conflicts between any two rules of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī. But many modern scholars, starting with Faddegon (1936), have tried to restrict  the scope of 1.4.2 further, to include only those rules that lie between 1.4.2 and 2.2.38: they  argue that since 1.4.2 lies within the ekā saṁjñā adhikāra (cf. 1.4.1 ā kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā ‘up  to 2.2.38 kaḍārāḥ karmadhāraye, each item can take only one saṁjñā’), the jurisdiction of  1.4.2 too should be suspended at 2.2.38.66 Kiparsky comes up with his own justification for  this interpretation, in which he argues that the alternate version of 1.4.1 mentioned by Patañjali  is proof of the fact that 1.4.2 only governs rules between 1.4.2 and 2.2.38. Let us look at  Patañjali’s commentary first, and then consider Kiparsky’s argument based on it. On 1.4.1,  Patañjali suggests that Pāṇini has taught two different versions of 1.4.1 to his pupils: 

kathaṁ tv etat sūtram paṭhitavyam. kim ā kaḍārād ekā saṁjñeti. āhosvit prāk kaḍārāt paraṁ kāryam iti. kutaḥ punar ayaṁ sandehaḥ. ubhayathā hy ācāryeṇa śiṣyāḥ sūtraṁ pratipāditāḥ.  kecid ākaḍārād ekā saṁjñeti. kecit prāk kaḍārāt paraṁ kāryam iti. kaś cātra viśeṣaḥ. 

tatraikasaṁjñādhikāre tadvacanaṁ (vt. 2) 

tatraikasaṁjñādhikāre tadvaktavyam. kim. ekā saṁjñā bhavatīti. nanu ca yasyāpi  paraṁkāryatvaṁ tenāpi paragrahaṇaṁ kartavyam. parārtham mama bhaviṣyati. vipratiṣedhe  ca iti. mamāpi tarhy ekagrahaṇam parārthaṁ bhaviṣyati. sarūpāṇām ekaśeṣa ekavibhaktau  iti.67 

66 On this, Joshi (1998: 58) makes an interesting remark: ‘in his 1936 publication on Pāṇini’s grammar  (p. 26-27) B. Faddegon casually notes that P. 1.4.2 is a paribhāṣā, and that it is valid up to the end of  P. 2.2, as if there never had been any doubt. Compare further Cardona 1976, p. 190.’ 67 Mbh I.296.11-18.

27 

“But how should this rule be read? Is it ā kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā68 or prāk kaḍārāt paraṁ kāryam69? But how [does] this doubt [arise]? Because the students have been taught this rule  in both ways by the teacher. Some [have been taught] ā kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā [and] some prāk  kaḍārāt paraṁ kāryam. And what is the difference [between these alternative readings] here? 

In that section where one name applies, the statement of that [must be made]. (vt. 2) 

In that section where one name applies, that should be stated. What [should be stated]? That  only one saṁjñā applies [per item]. However, one who [believes that] the following rule  [prevails] has to include the word para too. It will [serve] another [purpose] for me later [that  is, by continuation, in] vipratiṣedhe ca. For me too then, the mention of eka will [serve] another  [purpose], in sarūpāṇām ekaśeṣa ekavibhaktau.70”71 

The two versions of the rule pair 1.4.1-2 are: 1.4.1 ā kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā, 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe  param kāryam; and 1.4.1 prāk kaḍārād param kāryam, 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe ca. The former  version is found in the available manuscripts of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, while the latter version is first  mentioned by Patañjali himself. In the case of the latter, Patañjali only indirectly hints at what  I have called 1.4.2, when explaining how he could use para from 1.4.1 prāk kaḍārād paraṁ 

68 Up to 2.2.38 kaḍārāḥ karmadhāraye, each item can take only one saṁjñā. 

69 Up to 2.2.38 kaḍārāḥ karmadhāraye, the rule that comes later in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial order  prevails. 

70 In the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial order, 1.2.64 sarūpāṇām ekaśeṣa ekavibhaktau comes before 1.4.1 ā  kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā. So, one may wonder how Patañjali would be able to continue ekā from 1.4.1 into  1.2.64 by anuvr̥tti. I want to clarify here that Patañjali is proposing to reorder the rules such that ā  kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā comes before sarūpāṇām ekaśeṣa ekavibhaktau, so that he may be able to continue  ekā from the former into the latter by anuvr̥tti. I do not see how doing this would be justified or useful. 

71 Note that there is no evidence that Kātyāyana was aware of these two versions. Vt. 2  tatraikasaṁjñādikāre tadvacanaṁ (Mbh I.296.15) has been written in context of the first vārttika, and  not in the context of these supposedly different versions of 1.4.1 (and 1.4.2). The first vārttika reads:  anyatra saṁjñāsamāveśān niyamārthaṁ vacanam “Because names co-apply elsewhere, the statement  is for the sake of making a restriction.” (Mbh I.296.3). And so, the second vārttika continues to discuss  this topic: tatraikasaṁjñādikāre tadvacanaṁ ‘In that section where one name applies, the statement of  that [must be made].’ As is peculiar of Patañjali, he skilfully weaves Kātyāyana’s vārttikas into his own  discourse. But it must be borne in mind that, as far as we know, the idea of two different versions of  1.4.1 (and 1.4.2) is Patañjali’s alone. 

28 

kāryam later in the following rule (1.4.2) vipratiṣedhe ca through anuvr̥tti72. It logically follows  that its co-referent kāryam too would be continued into 1.4.2 along with paraṁ.  

1.4.1 prāk kaḍārād [paraṁ kāryam] 

1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe ca 





	Original version 

	Patañjali’s alternate version

	1.4.1 

	ā kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā 

	prāk kaḍārāt paraṁ kāryam

	1.4.2 

	vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam 

	vipratiṣedhe ca (paraṁ kāryam)

	







Note that both versions of 1.4.1 apply only to the section between 1.4.1 and 2.2.38, whereas  both versions of 1.4.2 apply to the entire Aṣṭādhyāyī. Besides, while the two versions of 1.4.1  say different things (one says ekā saṁjñā and the other says paraṁ kāryam), the two versions  of 1.4.2 essentially say the same thing. 

So, what does the alternative version of 1.4.1 i.e., prāk kaḍārāt paraṁ kāryam exactly mean?  It translates as: between 1.4.1 and 2.2.38 the later rule should be applied. But when? In which  context or situation? This version of 1.4.1 is at best ambiguous. Secondly, it seems very  unlikely that Pāṇini would teach two different versions of his own rules to his pupils. In the  following chapter, I reinterpret the meaning of para, which makes it clear that the alternate  version of 1.4.1 does not make sense. For all these reasons, I conclusively reject the alternate  version.  

On the other hand, Kiparsky assumes that the alternate version is the correct one, and uses this assumption to argue for restricting the scope of 1.4.2 to the section up to 2.2.38. He says, “A  very suggestive piece of evidence that the domain of 1.4.2 is limited to 1.4-2.2 is that Patañjali  actually records a variant reading of Pāṇini’s rules in which that must be the interpretation. In  discussing 1.4.1 Patañjali says, ‘How then is this rule to be read: as ā kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā “up  to kaḍāra (2.2.38) (everything gets only) one technical term” or as prāk kaḍārāt paraṁ kāryam  “up to kaḍāra apply the last”? Why is this an issue? Because the teacher [Pāṇini] had his  students recite both ways, some of the ā kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā, others prāk kaḍārāt paraṁ 

72 The presence of the word ca in 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe ca hints at the fact that some words would become  anuvr̥tta from 1.4.1 into 1.4.2.

29 

kāryam. Thus, these were still two versions of the rules in Patañjali’s time. Not surprisingly,  the version in which the domain of the para relation could be extended over the whole grammar  eventually won out. But it seems reasonable to assume that the version in which the domain  obviously has to be limited to 1.4 to 2.2 has a greater claim to authenticity.’73 

In his analysis, Kiparsky conveniently ignores the part where Patañjali talks about 1.4.2  vipratiṣedhe ca (param kāryam). If 1.4.1 is prāk kaḍārāt paraṁ kāryam, 1.4.2 would be vipratiṣedhe ca (param kāryam), as mentioned by Patañjali himself. Thus, the para relation  would still be applicable to the entire Aṣṭādhyāyī even if we accept the alternate version of  1.4.1-2 as being the actual or correct one. So, I conclude that contrary to Kiparsky’s claim, both  versions of the pair (1.4.1-2) allow the para relation to extend to the entire Aṣṭādhyāyī. Thus,  his speculation about why the ekā saṁjñā version won out does not pass muster, and the  argument that paraṁ kāryam does not hold beyond 2.2.38 too remains unsubstantiated. 

Now going back to the general argument that 1.4.2 does not apply beyond 2.2.38, Faddegon  and others reduced the scope of 1.4.2 with the objective of avoiding the application of 1.4.2 to  those cases of conflict wherein applying 1.4.2 may give the wrong answer. But we have already  seen in the derivation of ūrṇāyu that even within 1.4.1-2.2.38, the pūrva rule 1.4.16 siti ca 

prevails over the para rule 1.4.18 yaci bham. In other words, even within 1.4.1-2.2.38, 1.4.2  does not give the right answer.  

Besides, those conflicts which we come across in 1.4.2-2.2.38, which are essentially conflicts  between saṁjñā rules, can be successfully solved by choosing the specific rule (the exception)  over the general one, thereby rendering Faddegon’s restriction of 1.4.2’s scope redundant  anyway.74 For example, 1.4.16 siti ca, as we have seen above, is more specific than and  therefore an exception of 1.4.18 yaci bham. Thus 1.4.16 wins. Similarly, 1.4.11 saṁyoge guru 

(which teaches that a short vowel is called guru ‘heavy’ when followed by a consonantal  conjunct) is more specific than 1.4.10 hrasvaṁ laghu (which teaches that a short vowel is called  laghu ‘light’). Thus, 1.4.11 wins.  

73 Kiparsky 1982: 114. 

74 While Joshi (1998: 45)’s overall view on this topic is very different from mine, he makes some  observations which resonate with my findings: “the tradition in general is wrong…in thinking that  apavādatva cannot take care of the designations introduced in the ekā saṁjñā section”. 

30In the same way, 1.4.100 taṅānāv ātmanepadam (which teaches that taṄ, ŚānaC and KānaC,  which replace la, take the ātmanepada saṁjñā) is more specific than and thus defeats 1.4.99  laḥ parasmaipadam (which teaches that the affixes which replace la take the parasmaipada  saṁjñā’). Similarly, 1.4.46 adhiśīṅsthāsāṁ karma (which teaches that a kāraka which  constitutes the locus of the action is called karma with the verbs śīṄ ‘to lie down’, sthā ‘to  stand’, and ās ‘to sit’ occurring with preverb adhi) is more specific than and thus wins against 1.4.45 ādhāro’dhikaraṇam (which teaches that a kāraka which constitutes the locus of the  action is called adhikaraṇa).75 These examples satisfactorily prove that the apavāda tool is  sufficient to identify the winning rule in the section 1.4.1-2.2.38. 

Secondly, restricting the scope of 1.4.2 to 1.4.1-2.2.38 implies that Pāṇini has given us no  instructions about the conflicts that lie beyond 2.2.38, which I think is a highly unlikely  scenario. In any case, the few attempts that have been made to deal with conflicts beyond 2.2.38 by scholars such as Cardona (1970) and Joshi and Kiparsky (1979) address only certain types  of rule conflict and fail to paint an overarching picture.76 

### 1.7 My Opinion 

In my view, firstly, Pāṇini did not expect us to create the categories ‘tulyabala’ and  ‘atulyabala’. Secondly, I think that he taught 1.4.2 as a metarule which, rather than being  restricted to a particular section of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, is applicable to the entire Aṣṭādhyāyī. 

More broadly, I do not agree with both the traditional and the modern perspectives towards this  topic, because instead of trying to decipher the actual meaning of 1.4.2, these approaches try  to brush 1.4.2 under the carpet, to make it less effective or to weaken its impact. One does it  

75 Besides, there are some cases which may appear to be conflicts between rules teaching kāraka saṁjñās but which, according to me, are not conflicts at all. For example, whether one says geham praviśati (cf. 1.4.49 kartur īpsitatamaṁ karma 🡪 2.3.2 karmaṇi dvitīyā) or gehe praviśati (cf. 1.4.45  ādhāro’dhikaraṇam 🡪 2.3.36 saptamy adhikaraṇe ca) depends entirely on the non-linguistic feature  that the speaker wishes to express - that is, whether he/she wants to express kartur īpsitatama or ādhāra. So, this choice lies outside the domain of Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī. In conclusion, in my opinion, rule  conflict does not arise between 1.4.45 and 1.4.49.  

76 We shall look at limited blocking (Cardona) in chapter 4 and siddha principle (Joshi and Kiparsky)  in Appendix E.

31 

by excluding certain rule pairs from the scope of vipratiṣedha, and the other by reducing the  jurisdiction of 1.4.2. This approach which seeks to undervalue Pāṇini’s rule interaction mechanism and replaces it with self-invented methods of ‘rule conflict resolution’ can lead to  some success for a limited set or specific type of examples, but does not allow us to understand  and appreciate the larger picture.  

To get instructions about dealing with rule interaction, I try to rely, as much as possible, upon  ‘internal metarules’, that is, those metarules which Pāṇini has taught in his work, setting aside  any ‘external metarules’, that is, those metarules that are not found in the Aṣṭādhyāyī, such as  nityatva, antaraṅgatva, post-Pāṇinian paribhāṣās from the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, vārttikas 

that discuss rule interaction etc. In this thesis, I have come up with my own interpretation of  1.4.2 and, using that, I have reinterpreted Pāṇini’s derivational mechanism. I have attempted  to show that Pāṇini’s grammatical machine is self-sufficient, that is, its own (internal)  metarules, are able to run it with remarkable perfection, and that no external metarules are able  or required to aid this process.

32 

## 
Chapter Two 

### 2.1 Two Types of Operational Rule Interaction  

In the previous chapter, I have discussed how the tradition has misinterpreted 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe  paraṁ kāryam. In this section, I lay the conceptual foundation that will help us understand the  actual meaning of 1.4.2 in the next section (2.2).  

Over a period of time, I studied different examples in which two vidhi sūtras ‘operational rules’ are simultaneously applicable at the same step of a derivation, from both traditional sources  and modern literature. Henceforth, we will refer to such interaction between two  simultaneously applicable operational rules as ‘Same-Step Rule Interaction’, or simply SSRI. I tried to divide these examples into different groups on the basis of the similarities between  them.  

In my opinion, at any step in a derivation, even though two (or more) rules are applicable, only  one rule applies. So, I attempted to determine if, of the two competing rules, a certain kind of  rule always prevails over the other rule, in all the examples of that group. In other words, I  came up with one generalization per group about the result of such competition between rules.  The generalization that I made for one particular group of rules immediately caught my  attention. In order to highlight the common property that binds together the examples of this  group, first, I need to explain certain concepts, which I will do in this section. In section 2.2, I  will discuss the said group of examples, and how this group of examples led me to discover the  actual meaning of 1.4.2.  

Consider the two types of SSRI: 

Type 1: A + B 

 R1A R2A 

Type 2: A + B 

 RA RB

33 

We will call Type 1 Same Operand Interaction - henceforth SOI - because both rules R1A and R2A are applicable to the same operand A at the same step. We will call Type 2 Different  Operand Interaction - henceforth DOI - because the two rules RA and RB are applicable to two  different operands A and B respectively at the same step.  

In their efforts to understand the meaning of 1.4.2, both traditional and modern scholars have  failed to make good use of this clear distinction between SOI and DOI.1 Going further, we will  see that this distinction plays a critical role in helping us understand Pāṇini’s key rule 1.4.2  and, consequently, the entire derivational system of the Aṣṭādhyāyī.  

As stated before, in my opinion, at any step in a derivation, even though two (or more) rules  are applicable, only one rule applies. So, for both Type 1 and Type 2, we need to determine  which of the two rules should be applied at the given step.  

### 2.2 Solutions for Type 1 (SOI) and Type 2 (DOI) 

 A + B 

 R1A R2A 

Which one of the two rules R1A and R2A should we apply at this step? Pāṇini does not give us  any explicit instructions about solving SOI. In my view, if two rules are applicable  simultaneously to the same operand, the rule that is more specific, which we may call ‘the special or exception rule’, wins. Note that this is similar to the traditional notion that an  apavāda ‘exception’ rule defeats an utsarga ‘general’ rule.  

It is likely that Pāṇini did not deem it necessary to state explicitly that the exception rule defeats  the general rule in case of SOI because the general-exception framework is not a feature of  ‘grammar’ alone but more broadly, a feature of the sūtra style itself. Freschi and Pontillo (2013:  2) point out that “the basic framework of Sanskrit śāstras ‘systematic treatises’ is based on the  practical and effective opposition between general and specific rules”. 

1 Cardona (1970: 48) does recognize this distinction: “the general condition for vipratiṣedha is, as  noted…that two rules tentatively apply to provide operations which cannot possibly take place  concurrently. The two operations can involve (a) a single operand or (b) different operands.” But he  does not develop this intuition, relying instead on the traditional approach to rule interaction. 

34 

Note that the traditional approach is different from mine because: 

(i) The tradition does not draw a clear distinction between SOI and DOI. (ii) The tradition often ends up using tools other than utsarga-apavāda to resolve SOI.  

(iii) The tradition has not developed a systematic procedure to determine which of the two rules  involved in SOI is more specific.  

I will develop such a procedure later in this chapter. Now, let us look at DOI. A + B 

RA RB 

The group of examples referred to in section 2.1 are those that involve DOI. I noticed that in  the case of DOI, if we pick the right-hand side (henceforth, RHS) operation, that is, application  of rule RB to its operand B, over the left-hand side (henceforth, LHS) operation, that is, the  application of rule RA to operand A, we always get the correct answer. This led me to realize  the meaning of para in 1.4.2: para stands for the RHS operation. And thus, vipratiṣedha  ‘mutual opposition’ in 1.4.2 stands for DOI. I think it is apt to refer to DOI as vipratiṣedha 

‘mutual opposition’ because only one of the two operations wins, so in that sense, the two  operations oppose each other. In sum, 1.4.2 means: ‘in the event of DOI (mutual opposition  between the two operations), the RHS operation wins.’  

Note that even though in the previous chapter I frequently used the phrase ‘rule conflict’ - which has acquired a very specific connotation in modern Pāṇinian scholarship - to discuss the  traditional and modern interpretations of 1.4.2, I have not used this phrase in the context of my  own interpretation of 1.4.2. I interpret vipratiṣedha ‘mutual opposition’ as ‘DOI’ and not as  ‘rule conflict’. DOI and rule conflict are different concepts. I will discuss this topic in detail  later in this chapter. 

### 2.3 Evidence for My Interpretation of Para 

Before going further, let me provide more evidence to support my interpretation of para. The  meaning of para in 1.4.2 can be confirmed by looking at the meaning of para in the rest of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī. The term para has been used by Pāṇini on many occasions. Its occurrences can be  classified into two groups:

35 

Group A: 1.1.34, 1.4.109, 3.2.39, 3.3.138, 3.4.20, 4.3.5, 5.2.92, 5.3.29, 6.3.8.2 

Group B: 1.1.47, 1.1.51, 1.1.54, 1.1.57, 1.1.70, 1.2.40, 1.4.2, 1.4.62, 1.4.81, 2.1.2, 2.2.31,  2.4.26, 3.1.2, 6.1.84, 6.1.94, 6.1.112, 6.1.115, 6.1.120, 6.2.199, 6.4.156, 7.3.22, 7.3.27, 7.4.80,  7.4.88, 7.4.93, 8.1.2, 8.1.56, 8.2.92, 8.3.4, 8.3.6, 8.3.26, 8.3.27, 8.3.35, 8.3.87, 8.3.110, 8.3.118,  8.4.283, 8.4.58.4 

Let us consider an example from Group A. 1.1.34 pūrvaparāvaradakṣiṇottarāparādharāṇi  vyavasthāyām asaṁjñāyām (vibhāṣā jasi sarvanāmāni) teaches that the terms pūrva, para etc.  are called sarvanāma optionally when followed by Jas. In 1.1.34 and in the other rules  belonging to Group A, para is used as an ordinary word of the object language Sanskrit. In  these rules, it does not have any special technical connotation with respect to Pāṇini’s  derivational system. We are not interested in Group A, because 1.4.2 belongs to group B. 

Let us consider some examples from Group B. 1.1.47 mid aco’ntyāt paraḥ teaches that an item  marked with anubandha M is placed after, i.e., to the right-hand side of, the last vowel of the  item to which it is added. 1.1.51 ur aṇ raparaḥ teaches that r is added after, i.e., to the right  side of the vowels a, i, u when they are substitutes of r̥. 1.1.54 ādeḥ parasya teaches that a  substitute taught for the following or right-hand side item replaces its first sound. From these  examples, it becomes clear that in the rules I have listed under group B, para is used to mean  ‘right-hand side’ in the context of Pāṇinian derivations.  

Furthermore, we also see that in the Aṣṭādhyāyī the term pūrva, the antonym of para, when  used specifically in the context of Pāṇinian derivations, means LHS. For example, consider the  pair of rules 1.1.66 tasminn iti nirdiṣṭe pūrvasya and 1.1.67 tasmād ity uttarasya. 1.1.66 teaches  that when an item is taught (nirdiṣṭe) in the locative (tasminn iti), it means that the item to its  left-hand side (pūrvasya) undergoes an operation, and 1.1.67 teaches that, when an item is  

2 Since our focus is not on this group, I have not listed certain rules in which we find compounds or  secondary derivatives containing para. Examples include parasmaipada, parokṣa, aparokṣa, parovara, parama, and paraspara. 

3 The original rule is upasargād anotparaḥ, but Patañjali has suggested that it should be read as  upasargād bahulam. We find the latter version in many recensions. 

4 See Appendix F for the list of sūtras.

taught in the ablative (tasmād iti), it means that the item to its right-hand side (uttarasya)5 undergoes the operation6.  

Let us confirm this by considering some rules which contain both pūrva and para. 6.1.84 ekaḥ pūrvaparayoḥ teaches that (in the following rules) a single sound replaces both the LHS sound  and the RHS sound in case of saṁhitā ‘immediate proximity’. Similarly, 1.1.57 acaḥ parasmin  pūrvavidhau teaches that a substitute for a vowel, if it is conditioned by an RHS context, is  treated like its substituendum with respect to an operation on an LHS element. 

Besides, the word kāryam in 1.4.2 also gives us some crucial information. We know that in the  Aṣṭādhyāyī, Pāṇini does not generally use finite verbal forms in his rules. For example, in  6.1.77, he does not say iko yaṇ aci bhavati / kāryam, but simply iko yaṇ aci. So, in the case of  1.4.2 too, we can safely interpret kāryam as a noun rather than interpreting it as an optative  passive participle meaning ‘should be done’. What does the noun kārya generally mean? It  means ‘operation’, not ‘rule’. If Pāṇini wanted to say what the tradition interprets him as saying,  I think he would have simply said vipratiṣedhe paraṁ sūtram and not vipratiṣedhe paraṁ 

kāryam. All this corroborates my interpretation of para in 1.4.2.  

Let me summarize this topic now. In ordinary speech, para means ‘following, something that  lies after’. Accordingly, in 1.4.2, para actually means ‘that which comes after’ in the left-to right sense in the context of derivations. However, the tradition took it as ‘that which comes  after’ in the top (first)-to-bottom (last) or beginning-to-end sense in the context of the serial  order of rules. And so, while para in 1.4.2 refers to the operand or operation that lies after, or  on the right-hand side relative to another operand or operation, the tradition misunderstood it  as the rule which comes after the other rule in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. 

This leads to an important question: if traditional scholars interpreted para as ‘RHS  item/operation’ in so many metarules as shown above, why did they interpret it as ‘the  following rule’ in 1.4.2?7 I think this misunderstanding possibly arose because another  

5 Here uttara is a synonym of para. 

6 These are the traditional interpretations of these two rules. I discuss my interpretations of them in  Appendix B.  

7 While I will discuss this in detail in chapter 6, I must mention here that Kātyāyana mentions that para in 1.4.2 could mean ‘RHS’ in vt. 12 on 6.1.158 anudāttaṁ padam ekavarjam. He says:  śāstraparavipratiṣedhāniyamād vā śabdaparavipratiṣedhāt siddham ‘[in the event of vipratiṣedha between two operations] because it has not been [explicitly] mandated that paratva of rules [alone 

37 

metarule, 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham, uses pūrva, the opposite of para, to mean ‘preceding rule’.  8.2.1 teaches that from 8.2.1 onwards, a preceding rule treats a following rule as suspended.  This may have led Kātyāyana, the first scholar to comment upon Pāṇini’s sūtras, to think that,  in sūtras dealing with relationships between rules such as 8.2.1 and 1.4.2, pūrva and para mean  preceding rule and following rule respectively. However, upon closer examination, one realizes  that when Pāṇini wants to indicate that he is referring to the relationship between preceding  and following rules rather than operands, he adds the affix traL8 to the base: he says pūrva-tra in 8.2.1.9 This topic deserves our meticulous attention, and we will discuss it in greater detail  in chapter 5. Here is the summary of my comprehensive solution: 

Same Step Rule Interaction (SSRI)10 

  

 Type 1 (SOI) Type 2 (DOI = vipratiṣedha ‘mutual opposition’) 

  

 the exception rule wins RHS (para) operation wins 

### 2.4 A Key Difference Between SOI and DOI 

SOI and DOI have one prominent feature in common: in case of both SOI and DOI, two (or  more) rules are simultaneously applicable at a certain step of the derivation. However, it is  important to shed light on a key difference between SOI and DOI. This difference between SOI  and DOI pertains to whether or not they involve competition between two operands.

8 5.3.10 saptamyās tral. 

9 Pūrvatra stands for ‘with respect to a rule which comes earlier in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial order’.  10 As stated before, by ‘rule’, here I specifically mean vidhi sūtra ‘operational rule’. 

38 

Type 1 (SOI) 

	Type 2 (DOI)

	  

 A + B 

  

 R1A R2A

	 A + B 

  

 RA RB

	







In case of DOI, we see that the two simultaneously applicable rules RA and RB compete for the  sole position of the rule that applies at that step. But the two operands A and B too compete for  the sole position of the operand that undergoes an operation at that step. 

In case of SOI, the two simultaneously applicable rules R1A and R2A compete for the sole  position of the rule that applies at that step. However, since both are applicable to the same  operand A, we do not observe any competition between operands. 

Because Pāṇini has not given any instructions about SOI, but has taught the metarule 1.4.2 for  dealing with DOI, we can say that Pāṇini has given explicit instructions about how we must  deal with competition between operands (which we see in DOI but not in SOI), but not about  how we must deal with competition between rules (which we see in both DOI and SOI).  

Thus, we must understand vipratiṣedha in 1.4.2 not as mutual opposition between rules but  rather as mutual opposition between operands. 

### 2.5 Pāṇinian and Post-Pāṇinian Approaches to Derivations 

In order to determine why post-Pāṇinian (both traditional and modern) scholars have  misinterpreted Pāṇini’s rule 1.4.2, we need to understand that there is a fundamental difference  between what I think are Pāṇinian11 and post-Pāṇinian conceptions of, or perspectives towards,  the derivational procedure itself. I will explain exactly what I mean by this statement by means  of examining six representative examples of SSRI from both Pāṇinian and post-Pāṇinian  perspectives below.  

Let us start with the latter. But before we examine these representative examples from the post Pāṇinian perspective, let me explain certain fundamental concepts which will help us  

11 When I make the distinction between Pāṇinian and post-Pāṇinian approaches in the following pages,  it must be understood that by ‘Pāṇinian approach’, I mean ‘my interpretation of the Pāṇinian approach’.

39 

understand this perspective better. Let us divide SSRI into two categories, namely ‘conflict’  and ‘non-conflict’. In order to define conflict and non-conflict, we must first define blocking. Let us say that two rules X and Y are simultaneously applicable at step K12. We say that rule  X blocks rule Y if Y will not be applicable at the following step (K+1) after the hypothetical  application of X at the present step (K). Conflict is defined as an SSRI which involves some  blocking. Non-conflict is defined as an SSRI which does not involve any blocking. 

SSRI 

 blocking no blocking 

 conflict non-conflict 

Note that, in my opinion, Pāṇini has not defined or discussed the categories ‘conflict’ and ‘non conflict’ in any way whatsoever, and he does not expect us to know about or use them either.  Traditional scholars too have not made an explicit distinction between conflict and non conflict. In modern / western scholarship, the concept of ‘(rule) conflict’ has been widely used,  but ‘non-conflict’ has not been used at all.  

Then, the question arises: why have I made this distinction between conflict and non-conflict?  I have done this to highlight that, for the most part, post-Pāṇinian scholarship has focused on  conflict and has not paid much attention to non-conflict. Why is this the case? To answer this  question, let us look closely at non-conflict, wherein the two rules X and Y do not block each  other: if X applies at the present step, then Y is applicable at the following step, and if Y applies  at the present step, then X is applicable at the following step. Before we go further, note that  ‘being applicable’ is different from ‘applying’. Consider the following situation: 

12 In other words, let us say that there is an SSRI between X and Y.

40Step 1: g h 

 X Y 

Let us say Y applies at this step, changing h to h*. Now, at the following step, not only X but  another rule Z too becomes applicable: 

Step 2: g h* 

 X Z 

Suppose that Z, and not X, applies at step 2.  

Here, we see that, if Y applies at step 1, X is applicable at the step 2.13 However, X does not  apply at the step 2. This is the difference between ‘being applicable’ and ‘applying’. 

Now, let us go back to our conversation about why post-Pāṇinian scholarship does not take  much interest in non-conflict. In most cases of non-conflict, if X applies at the present step,  then Y is not only applicable but also applies at the following step. Similarly, if Y applies at  the present step, then X is not only applicable but also applies at the following step. Thus,  regardless of the order in which the two rules apply, one gets the correct form at the end of the  derivation. This explains why the tradition can afford to overlook such examples of non 

conflict, which, as I said, constitute a huge majority of the set of all non-conflict examples. 

However, there is a minority of examples of non-conflict wherein if Y applies at the present  step, X is applicable at the following step, but does not end up applying at the following step.  The tradition does take some interest in such examples of non-conflict, which constitute a very  tiny minority of the set of all non-conflict examples. 

Having defined both blocking and conflict, now let us look at how post-Pāṇinian scholarship  views the following representative examples: 

13 So, going by the definition of blocking, Y does not block X.

41 

1) k + l 

 W R 

If we apply R at this step, W will be applicable at the following step. R does not block W. If we apply W at this step, R will not be applicable at the following step. W blocks R. 

We call this a case of asymmetrical or unidirectional blocking. Since this interaction involves  blocking, this is a case of conflict. Such examples are of interest to post-Pāṇinian scholars. 

2) m + n 

 S V 

If we apply S at this step, V will not be applicable at the following step. S blocks V. If we apply V at this step, S will not be applicable at the following step. V blocks S. 

We call this a case of symmetrical or mutual blocking. Since this interaction involves blocking,  this is a case of conflict. Such examples are of interest to post-Pāṇinian scholars. 

3) e + f 

 P Y 

If we apply P at this step, Y will be applicable at the following step. P does not block Y. If we apply Y at this step, P will not be applicable at the following step. Y blocks P. 

We call this a case of asymmetrical or unidirectional blocking. Since this interaction involves  blocking, this is a case of conflict. Such examples are of interest to post-Pāṇinian scholars. 

4) g + h 

 Q X 

If we apply Q at this step, X will not be applicable at the following step. Q blocks X.  If we apply X at this step, Q will not be applicable at the following step. X blocks Q. 

We call this a case of symmetrical or mutual blocking. Since this interaction involves blocking,  this is a case of conflict. Such examples are of interest to post-Pāṇinian scholars.

42 

Post-Pāṇinian scholars are very interested in these four representative examples (REs). But one  may ask: what about the remaining two REs? Let us look at them. 

5) i + j 

 U T 

If we apply T at this step, U will be applicable at the following step. T does not block U. If we apply U at this step, T will be applicable at the following step. U does not block T. 

There is no blocking, so this is a case of non-conflict. The tradition does not think about or pay  much heed to this kind of situation, for the most part.  

6) c + d 

 O Z  

If we apply O at this step, Z will be applicable at the following step. O does not block Z. If we apply Z at this step, O will be applicable at the following step. Z does not block O. 

There is no blocking, so this is a case of non-conflict. The tradition does not think about or pay  much heed to this kind of situation, for the most part. 

Let us now summarize the relationship between blocking and conflict. 

No blocking 

	Non-Conflict

	Unidirectional blocking 

	Conflict

	Mutual blocking 

	Conflict

	







Before we continue discussing these six examples from the post-Pāṇinian perspective, let us  consider the Pāṇinian perspective on them:

43 

1) k + l 

 W R 

This is a case of SOI. Let us say W is more specific. Thus, W wins. 

2) m + n 

 S V 

This is a case of SOI. Let us say V is more specific. Thus, V wins. 

3) e + f 

 P Y 

This is a case of DOI. By 1.4.2, the RHS rule Y wins.  

4) g + h 

 Q X 

This is a case of DOI. By 1.4.2, the RHS rule X wins.  

5) i + j 

 U T 

This is a case of SOI. Let us say U is more specific. Thus, U wins. 

6) c + d 

 O Z  

This is a case of DOI. By 1.4.2, the RHS rule Z wins. 

Note that in all six representative examples discussed here, Pāṇini does not require us to worry  about what happens to the losing rule, for instance, P, in example 3: we need not be concerned  about whether or not P is applicable at the following step, or whether or not P actually applies  at the following step. In other words, Pāṇini does not use concepts like blocking and conflict  to give instructions about dealing with SOI and DOI.

44 

Even though Pāṇini does not use concepts like ‘conflict’ to give instructions about SSRI, and  even though the tradition makes no explicit distinction between SOI and DOI, let us discuss  both Pāṇinian and post-Pāṇinian concepts under one umbrella to understand this topic better. I  have included both SOI and DOI examples because Pāṇini deals with them separately and have  included examples of both conflict and non-conflict because the post-Pāṇinian approach  subconsciously makes this distinction by focusing on conflict alone. Here is a summary of the  examples:

Representative examples 1, 2, 3 and 4 are of significant interest to post-Pāṇinian scholarship  because they involve some kind of blocking, thereby constituting cases of conflict. 

### 2.6 Traditional Solutions 

Now let us look at how the tradition solves examples of conflict. As stated in the previous  chapter, traditional scholars tried to use their interpretation of 1.4.2 (the rule that comes later  in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī wins the conflict) to resolve such conflicts. This often gave  them the wrong answer, so in order to reduce the challenges posed by their interpretation of  1.4.2, they significantly reduced the scope of applicability of 1.4.2. 

They achieved this by restricting the meaning of vipratiṣedha to tulyabalavirodha ‘conflicts between rules of equal strength’. So, 1.4.2 does not apply to pairs of conflicting rules if the two  rules are not of equal strength. In the case of such pairs of unequal strength, the rule which is  

14 RE = ‘Representative Example’. 

15 Only a minority of cases of SOI involve unidirectional blocking. Most cases of SOI involve mutual  blocking. 

45 

stronger than the other wins. The tradition has come up with certain methods to identify these  pairs of unequal strength. While we have already looked at some of them in the previous  chapter, I will briefly discuss them below to outline which tool is used to deal with what kind  of interaction (SOI / DOI) and what kind of blocking (unidirectional / mutual).16 

1. nitya > anitya: in a conflict between two rules A and B, A is called nitya with respect to B  if A is applicable (both before and) after the application of B. B is called anitya with respect to  A if B is applicable before but not after the application of A. The nitya rule A is stronger than  and defeats the anitya rule B. In other words, A wins against B if A unidirectionally blocks B. 

2. antaraṅga > bahiraṅga: according to the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, ‘antaraṅga is (a rule) the  causes (of the application) of which lie within (or before) the sum of the causes of a bahiraṅga rule’.17 Note that this tool is seldom used to solve actual cases of conflict and is mostly only  used to solve what I call cases of pseudo-conflict. We will delve into this in Appendix C. 

3. apavāda > utsarga: an exception rule, or a more specific rule, defeats the general rule. 

4. pūrvavipratiṣiddha: when applying 1.4.2 gives the wrong answer, Kātyāyana comes up with  pūrvavipratiṣiddha vārttikas. These state that in certain cases, contrary to what is taught by the  traditional interpretation of 1.4.2, it is not the para rule (the rule which comes after the other  rule in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī), but instead the pūrva rule (the rule that comes before  the other rule in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī) that wins. Pūrvavipratiṣiddha too has come  to be used like a conflict resolution tool. Here are two well-known examples of such vārttikas  (vt. 10 and 1118 respectively on 7.1.96 striyāṁ ca): 

16 In the previous chapter I have discussed the hierarchy of these rules (Pbh 38 of the  Paribhāṣenduśekhara), so I do not discuss it here again. This hierarchy is not of much consequence,  practically speaking. 

17 See Abhyankar’s reprint (second edition) of Kielhorn’s work (1960: 221-222). 18 Mbh III.275.23-276.12.

46 

a. vt. 10 guṇavr̥ddhyauttvatr̥jvadbhāvebhyo num pūrvavipratiṣiddham: in case of vipratiṣedha,  the pūrva sūtra, which teaches the insertion of the augment nUM, takes precedence over para  sūtras which teach (i) guṇa19, (ii) vr̥ddhi20, (iii) auttva21, (iv) tr̥jvadbhāva22. 

b. vt. 11 numaciratr̥jvadbhāvebhyo nuṭ (pūrvavipratiṣiddham): in case of vipratiṣedha, the  pūrva sūtra, which teaches the insertion of the augment nUṬ23 takes precedence over para  sūtras which teach (i) numāgama ‘insertion of augment nUM’24, (ii) replacement with r when  followed by a vowel (aC)25, (iii) tr̥jvadbhāva26.  

5. niravakāśa / anavakāśa > sāvakāśa27: In his first vārttika28 on 1.4.2, Kātyāyana defines  vipratiṣedha as a conflict which arises between two sāvakāśa rules: dvau prasaṅgāv anyārthāv  ekasmin sa vipratiṣedhaḥ ‘[When] two rules [which are] applicable elsewhere (i.e., in other  derivations) [become applicable] at the same place, this [situation is called] vipratiṣedha’. But  when one of the two rules is niravakāśa, that is, when it does not have scope to apply elsewhere,  such a conflict is not called vipratiṣedha. In such cases, the niravakāśa rule is thought to be  stronger than the sāvakāśa rule. The niravakāśa rule wins. 

As discussed in the previous chapter, the tradition does not apply these tools consistently, and  often, applying some of these tools gives the wrong form. Nonetheless, through the table  presented below, I try to give a broad and general overview of the tools that are used to deal  with different kinds of conflicts: 

19 7.3.111 gher ṅiti. 

20 7.2.115 aco ñṇiti. 

21 7.3.119 ac ca gheḥ. 

22 7.1.95 tr̥jvat kroṣṭuḥ.

25 7.2.100 aci ra r̥taḥ.

27 niravakāśā hi vidhayaḥ sāvakāśān vidhīn bādhante ‘niravakāśa operations defeat sāvakāśa operations’ (Pbh 11 of Vyāḍiparibhāṣāpāṭha).

Lastly, alongside these tools, the tradition liberally uses (its interpretation of) 1.4.2 to deal with  all kinds of conflict when it is necessary and / or desirable to do so.  

### 2.7 Examples of DOI 

In my opinion, 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam means: in the event of DOI, the RHS rule  wins. As stated before, I have not used the term ‘rule conflict’ in my interpretation of 1.4.2.  This is because I think that Pāṇini does not require us to use such a concept to understand 1.4.2,  and consequently, to perform derivations correctly. 

However, as shown above, all post-Pāṇinian discussion pertaining to 1.4.2 has focused on  conflict. So, I do need to deal with the topic of conflict to contextualize my findings in the  contemporary discourse. In other words, I need to show that my interpretation of 1.4.2 correctly  resolves examples of DOI conflict, which I will call Type 2a henceforth. For each example, I  will first prove that the example involves conflict, then discuss my solution to it, and finally  present the traditional solution to it. 

Even though the tradition is not very interested in non-conflict, I will also show that 1.4.2 helps  deal with examples of DOI non-conflict, which I will call Type 2b henceforth.  

Before we start looking at examples, here is a diagram which summarizes this topic:

48 

Type 2 (DOI = vipratiṣedha)  

unidirectional blocking (RE29 3) mutual blocking (RE 4) no blocking (RE 6) 

 DOI conflict (Type 2a) DOI non-conflict (Type 2b)  [of significant interest to the tradition] [not of much interest to the tradition] 

  

 My solution: 1.4.2 (RHS wins) 

Note the difference between vipratiṣedha, as interpreted by me, and the concept of conflict,  which is popularly discussed in modern post-Pāṇinian literature, in the diagram above.  

In this section, I have chosen examples from nominal inflection.30 

In all derivations performed in this thesis, I present only those steps diagrammatically at which  multiple rules are simultaneously applicable. For example, at step a + b, if rules R1 and R2 are  applicable to a and b respectively, then I draw the following kind of diagram to illustrate the  same: 

a + b 

 R1 R2 

However, if only one rule K1 is applicable (to c) at a given step c + d, then I do not draw  diagrams of the following kind to represent this: 

29 RE = ‘Representative Example’. 

30 Note that examples from nominal inflection are simpler than those from verbal inflection. One of the  many reasons behind this is that, while nominal inflection involves only two items, i.e., a base and affix,  verbal inflection generally involves at least three items, i.e., a base followed by two affixes. We will  look at examples from verbal inflections as well as primary and secondary derivatives in the following  chapters.

49 

c + d 

 K1 

Instead, I simply describe this in words, or symbolically, as follows: c + d 🡪 c* + d (K1). 

(1) deva + bhis – ‘God’ (masculine), instrumental plural 

 deva + bhis 

 7.3.103 7.1.9 

7.3.103 bahuvacane jhaly et (ataḥ supi): an e replaces the final a of a nominal base when a  plural declensional affix starting with jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative) follows. 

7.1.9 ato bhisa ais: ais replaces bhis when bhis occurs after an a-final base. 

If bhis is replaced with vowel-initial ais by 7.1.9, then 7.3.103, which applies to only those  bases which are followed by a jhaL-initial affix, will not be applicable at the following step.  Similarly, if the a of deva is replaced with e by 7.3.103, then 7.1.9, which applies to affixes  that are preceded by a-final bases, will not be applicable at the following step.  

Therefore, 7.1.9 and 7.3.103 block each other. This is a case of mutual blocking, and thus of  Type 2a (DOI conflict). 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS operation 7.1.9 wins, leading to the correct form: deva + ais 🡪 devais (6.1.88 vr̥ddhir eci) 🡪 devair (8.2.66 sasajuṣoḥ ruḥ) 🡪 devaiḥ (8.3.15  kharavasānayor visarjanīyaḥ). 

In his comments on 7.1.9, Patañjali tries to solve this conflict by using paratva (the rule that  comes later in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī wins) but that gives the wrong answer:  *devebhis. He then asserts that 7.1.9 is nitya and thus wins, giving the correct form: devaiḥ.31 His explanation for calling 7.1.9 nitya is illogical at best, and we will not delve into it. Suffice  it to say that the nitya tool, which can only solve cases of unidirectional blocking, cannot be  applied to the present case of mutual blocking. Pradīpa and Uddyota, the two popular  commentaries on the Mahābhāṣya suggest that the rule 7.1.9 is anavakāśa whereas 7.3.103 is  

31 Mbh III.244.13-21.

50sāvakāśa. So, the former wins. The anavakāśa tool is simply a technical way of arguing the  following: 

(i) 7.1.9 does not apply anywhere else.  

(ii) Surely, Pāṇini must have composed 7.1.9 because it applies somewhere.  From (i) and (ii), the tradition concludes that it has to apply here. 

For this and many other examples, instead of following a systematic procedure of rule conflict  resolution, the tradition adopts a trial-and-error approach to come up with a justification for the  application of the rule which leads to the correct form. 

(2) hari + āṄ – ‘green’ (masculine), instrumental singular 

 hari + āṄ32 

 6.1.77 7.3.120 

6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci: iK (i, u, r̥, l̥) is replaced with yaṆ (y, v, r, l) when aC (any vowel) follows. 

7.3.120 āṅo nāstriyām: nā replaces the affix āṄ, when it occurs after a non-feminine base  termed ghi (a base ending in i or u except sakhi).  

If the i of hari is replaced with y by 6.1.77, then 7.3.120 which applies only to bases ending in  i or u, will not be applicable at the following step. And if āṄ is replaced with consonant-initial  nā, then 6.1.77, which could have applied to the i of hari when it is followed by a vowel, will  no longer be applicable. Thus, 7.3.120 and 6.1.77 block each other. 

This is a case of mutual blocking, and thus of Type 2a (DOI conflict).  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS operation 7.3.120 wins, leading to the correct form:  hariṇā.33 

32 The instrumental singular affix taught by 4.1.2 sv-au-jas… is Ṭā and not āṄ. The use of āṄ instead  of Ṭā “is best understood as reflecting earlier traditions” (Cardona 1997: 51). 

33 n > ṇ, by 8.4.2 aṭkupvāṅnumvyavāye’pi.

To the best of my knowledge, the tradition does not discuss this conflict. But I would guess  that it would have used its interpretation of 1.4.2 (the rule that comes later in the serial order  of the Aṣṭādhyāyī wins) or niravakāśatva to solve it. 

(3) vāri + āṄ – ‘water’ (neuter), instrumental singular 

For reasons I will clarify below, let us look at the three rules which are applicable at this step  without resorting to a diagram: 

6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci: same as above. 

7.1.73 iko’ci vibhaktau (num napuṁsakasya): augment nUM is attached to a neuter base ending  in iK (i, u, r̥, l̥) when a vowel-initial declensional affix follows. 

7.3.120 āṅo nāstriyām: same as above. 

The important question to ask here is, how should we regard the interaction between 6.1.77 iko  yaṇ aci and 7.1.73 iko’ci vibhaktau? Is it a case of SOI or that of DOI? 

One could argue that it is a case of DOI. Let me explain why. 6.1.77 is applicable to i of vāri. On the other hand, by 1.1.47 mid aco’ntyāt paraḥ (which teaches that an item marked with M  is placed after i.e., to the RHS of the last vowel of the morpheme), 7.1.73 is applicable, not to  i, but instead to the (currently empty) position that is to the right-hand side of i. Additionally,  note that 1.1.47 uses the term para which is also used in the rule governing DOI (cf. 1.4.2  vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam). For these reasons, one could say that the two rules are applicable to two different operands. Here is the diagrammatic representation of the same: 

 vār i + āṄ 

 6.1.77 7.1.73 7.3.120 On the other hand, one could argue that the interaction between 6.1.77 and 7.1.73 is a case of  SOI because the whole base vāri itself is the common operand of both 6.1.77 and 7.1.73. Here  is the diagrammatic representation of the same: 

 [vāri] + āṄ 

 6.1.77 7.1.73 7.3.120

52 

In fact, we ought to answer other similar questions before moving forward: if there is an SSRI  between a rule teaching the attachment of an augment marked with Ṭ (cf. 1.1.46 ādyantau  ṭakitau34) to a given item and a rule teaching the substitution of the first sound of that item,  then should that interaction be treated as an SOI or as a DOI? Similarly, if there is an SSRI  between a rule teaching the attachment of an augment marked with K (cf. 1.1.46 ādyantau  ṭakitau) to a given item and a rule teaching the substitution of the last sound of that item, then  should that interaction be treated as an SOI or as a DOI? 

Without looking at a large number of examples of SSRI involving augments marked with M, Ṭ or K, it would be difficult to decide which of the two positions is correct. In my thesis, I do  not focus on augments and thus am not in a position to definitively answer the aforementioned  questions. For the sake of this thesis, I have treated examples of the aforementioned kind  involving M-marked augments as cases of DOI and those of the aforementioned kind involving  Ṭ- or K-marked augments as cases of SOI. I have done this so that the reader may get exposure  to both positions – one, that these are cases of SOI and the other, that these are cases of DOI.  This will help set the stage for future research on this topic. 

Coming back to the present example, this is a case of DOI between the three rules.   vār i + āṄ 

 6.1.77 7.1.73 7.3.120 Now let us look at the relationships between these rules. We have already seen in the previous  example that 6.1.77 and 7.3.120 block each other.  

Let us look at the DOI interaction between 6.1.77 and 7.1.73. If vāri takes the augment nUM by 7.1.73, then we get vārin which does not end in vowel i and thus, 6.1.77 will not be  applicable at the following step. If i of vāri is replaced with y by 6.1.77, then we get vāry which  does not end in i, thus 7.1.73 will not be applicable at the following step. Thus, 6.1.77 and  7.1.73 block each other. This is a case of mutual blocking and thus of Type 2a (DOI conflict).  

Now let us look at the DOI interaction between 7.1.73 and 7.3.120. If vāri takes the augment  nUM by 7.1.73, thereby becoming consonant-final vārin, then 7.3.120, which applies only to  

34 Items marked with Ṭ and items marked with K should be attached to the beginning and end  respectively.

53 

those affixes that are preceded by ghi bases ending in i or u, will not be applicable at the  following step. And if consonant-initial nā replaces Ṭā by 7.3.120, then 7.1.73 which only  applies to certain bases followed by vowel-initial affixes will not be applicable at the following  step. Thus, 7.3.120 and 7.1.73 block each other. This is a case of mutual blocking, and thus of  DOI conflict.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right-most rule 7.3.12035 and get the correct form:  vāriṇā.36 

We have already discussed the traditional position on the conflict between 6.1.77 and 7.3.120 in the previous example. I do not think the tradition discusses the conflict between 6.1.77 and  7.1.73. We can assume that it would use its interpretation of 1.4.2 (the rule that comes later in  the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī wins) or the apavāda tool to solve this conflict. As for the  conflict between 7.1.73 and 7.3.120, the Bālamanoramā commentary on the Siddhāntakaumudī solves it using the traditional interpretation of 1.4.2.  

(4) strī + ām – ‘woman’ (feminine), genitive plural 

strī + ām 

6.4.79 7.1.54 

6.4.79 striyāḥ (aci iyaṅ): the final sound of the base strī is replaced with iyAṄ when a vowel initial affix follows. 

7.1.54 hrasvanadyāpo nuṭ (āmi): augment nUṬ is introduced to affix ām when it occurs after a  nominal base which ends in a short vowel, or is termed nadī (feminine long ī- and ū-final  bases), or has taken the feminine affix ṬāP. 

If the ī of strī is replaced with iyAṄ by 6.4.79, thereby making it striy, then 7.1.54, which  applies to ām when preceded by nadī-final vowels ī and ū, will not be applicable at the  following step.  

35 Note that this is one of the rare cases in which even if we had applied another rule, namely 7.1.73,  we would still have got the correct form. 

36 n > ṇ, by 8.4.2 aṭkupvāṅnumvyavāye’pi.

54 

If the augment nUṬ is added to the affix ām by 7.1.54, thereby making it consonant-initial nām,  then 6.4.79, which is only applicable to the base strī when it is followed by vowel-initial affixes,  will not be applicable at the following step.  

This is a case of mutual blocking, and thus of Type 2a (DOI conflict).  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS operation 7.1.54 wins, leading to the correct form:  strīṇām.37 

The Bhaimī commentary on the Laghusiddhāntakaumudī solves the conflict between 6.4.79 and 7.1.54 using the traditional interpretation of 1.4.2 (i.e., the rule that comes later in the serial  order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī wins). 

(5) vāri + ām – ‘water’ (neuter), genitive plural 

 vāri + ām 

 7.1.73 7.1.54 

7.1.73 iko’ci vibhaktau (num napuṁsakasya): augment nUM is attached to a neuter base ending  in iK (i, u, r̥, l̥) when a vowel-initial declensional affix follows. 

7.1.54 hrasvanadyāpo nuṭ (āmi): same as above. 

If the augment nUM is attached to vāri by 7.1.73, thereby making it consonant-final vārin (1.1.47 mid aco’ntyāt paraḥ), then 7.1.54, which only applies to ām when it is preceded by  certain vowel-final bases, will not be applicable at the following step.  

On the other hand, if the augment nUṬ is attached to the affix ām by 7.1.54, thereby making it  consonant-initial nām, then 7.1.73, which is only applicable to certain bases that are followed  by vowel-initial affixes, will not be applicable at the following step.  

Both 7.1.54 and 7.1.73 block each other. This is a case of mutual blocking, and thus of Type  2a (DOI conflict).  

37 n > ṇ, by 8.4.2 aṭkupvāṅnumvyavāye’pi.

55 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS operation 7.1.54 wins, leading to the correct form:  vārīṇām38 (6.4.3 nāmi, 8.4.2 aṭkupvāṅnumvyavāye’pi). 

The tradition resorts to Kātyāyana’s vārttika ‘numaciratr̥jvadbhāvebhyo nuṭ pūrvavipratiṣiddham’ (vt. 1139 on 7.1.96 striyāṁ ca) to solve this conflict. This vārttika teaches  that even though the rule teaching the attachment of the augment nUṬ (7.1.54) comes before  the rule teaching the attachment of the augment of nUM (7.1.73) in the serial order of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī, the former wins. In this and other pūrvavipratiṣiddha vārttikas, Kātyāyana simply  lists those conflicts which cannot be correctly solved using the traditional interpretation of  1.4.2. 

(6) kroṣṭu + ām – ‘jackal’ (masculine), genitive plural 

kroṣṭu + ām 

 7.1.97 7.1.54 

7.1.97 vibhāṣā tr̥tīyādiṣv aci (tr̥jvat kroṣṭuḥ): ‘the base kroṣṭu, is treated as if ending in affix  tr̥C optionally, when a vowel-initial ending of the tr̥tīyā triplet (instrumental) or any of the  following triplets (namely dative, ablative, genitive or locative) follows.40 

7.1.54 hrasvanadyāpo nuṭ (āmi): same as above. 

If the u of kroṣṭu becomes r̥ by 7.1.97, then 7.1.54, which applies to ām when it is preceded by  any of the short vowels, will be applicable to ām at the following step. But if the augment nUṬ is added to ām by 7.1.54, thereby making it (consonant-initial) nām, then 7.1.97, which applies  to kroṣṭu only when it is followed by a vowel-initial tritīyādi affix, will not be applicable at the  following step.  

38 Note that both augments i.e., nUM and nUṬ essentially refer to the same sound n. However, if we  applied the rule prescribing nUM, we would get vārin + ām (1.1.47 mid aco’ntyāt paraḥ). In such a  situation, we would not be able to elongate the ī of vārin because 6.4.3 nāmi would not apply here. 39 Mbh III.276.6. 

40 Note that this is not actually an operational rule, but an atideśa sūtra ‘extension rule’. For the sake  of studying conflict, we may treat it as an operational rule which teaches that the u of kroṣṭu changes to  r̥.

56 

7.1.54 blocks 7.1.97, but 7.1.97 does not block 7.1.54. This is a case of unidirectional blocking,  and thus of DOI conflict.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS operation 7.1.54 wins, leading to the correct form:  kroṣṭūnām (6.4.3 nāmi). 

Since this is a case of unidirectional blocking, the tradition could have used the nitya tool to  solve this conflict. However, it does not do so.41 Instead, Kātyāyana has written the vārttika ‘numaciratr̥jvadbhāvebhyo nuṭ pūrvavipratiṣiddham’ (vt. 1142 on 7.1.96 striyāṁ ca) to solve  it. This vārttika teaches that even though the rule teaching the attachment of the augment nUṬ (7.1.54) comes before the rule teaching tr̥jvadbhāva (7.1.97) in the serial order of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī, the former wins.  

(7) kartr̥ + sU – ‘doer’ (neuter), nominative singular 

kartr̥ + sU 

 7.1.94 7.1.23  

7.1.94 r̥duśanaspurudaṁso’nehasāṁ ca (asambuddhau anaṅ sau): the final sound of a base  ending in r̥Ṭ or of the bases uśanas, purudaṁsas and anehas is substituted with anAṄ when  followed by non-vocative sU. 

7.1.23 svamor napuṁsakāt (luk): affixes sU and am occurring after a neuter base are substituted  with LUK. 

If we apply 7.1.23, then 7.1.94, which applies only when followed by sU, will not be applicable at the following step. If we apply 7.1.94, then 7.1.23, which applies to any neuter base  regardless of its final sound, will be applicable at the following step.  

This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of Type 2a (DOI conflict).  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS operation 7.1.23 wins, thereby giving the correct form:  kartr̥. 

41 This is discussed in Pradīpa on vt. 11, 7.1.96. 

42 Mbh III.276.6.

57 

To the best of my knowledge, the tradition does not discuss this conflict. However, I think it  would use the nitya tool (the rule that unidirectionally blocks the other wins) to solve it. 

(8) tad + sU – ‘that’ (neuter), nominative singular 

 tad + sU 

 7.2.102 7.1.23  

7.2.102 tyadādīnām aḥ (vibhaktau): the final sound of a base belonging to the group headed by  tyad ‘that’ is replaced with a when a declensional affix follows. 

7.1.23 svamor napuṁsakāt (luk): same as above. 

What kind of interaction occurs between the two rules? The tradition seems to be confused  about this. So, let us start by looking at my solution. 

This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 7.1.23 wins, giving us the  correct answer: tad.43 

In his commentary44 on 7.1.23, Patañjali first tries to use the traditional interpretation of 1.4.2  (the rule that comes later in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī wins) to determine which of the  two rules he must apply. But he gets the wrong answer upon doing so. Then, he tries to use the  nitya tool.  

If we apply 7.1.23 at this step, 7.2.102 will not be applicable at the following step. On the other  hand, if we apply 7.2.102 at this step, 7.1.23 will still be applicable at the following step. Thus,  this is a case of unidirectional blocking, and of Type 2a (DOI conflict). Therefore, the nitya tool can be used here.  

However, Patañjali then says that 7.1.23 is not nitya with respect to 7.2.102. This is because,  after the hypothetical application of 7.2.102, 7.1.23 is not the only rule that will be applicable.  7.1.24 ato ’m45 will also be applicable. Since 7.1.24 is an apavāda of 7.1.23, the former will  win. So 7.1.23 will, despite being applicable, fail to apply, following the application of 7.2.102.  

43 Note that 7.2.102 is not applicable at this point, thanks to 1.1.63 na lumatāṅgasya. 44 Mbh III.248.23-249.2. 

45 Affixes sU and am occurring after a neuter base ending in a are replaced with am.

58 

For this reason, Patañjali says that 7.1.23 cannot be called nitya with respect to 7.2.102. To  deal with this problem, Patañjali suggests some changes in the wording of 7.1.23 svamor  napuṁsakāt. We will not dwell on his argument, because it is beyond our scope.  

Contrary to Patañjali’s conclusion that 7.1.23 cannot be called nitya, according to paribhāṣā 47 of the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, 7.1.23 is nitya and thus should win. It reads: yasya ca  lakṣaṇāntareṇa nimittaṁ vihanyate na tad anityam. Kielhorn translates it as follows: ‘(an  operation [here 7.1.23]), the cause of which would, (after the taking effect of another operation  [here, 7.2.102] that applies simultaneously), be removed by another (third) rule [here, 7.1.24],  is not (on that account regarded as) anitya.’ 

(9) vāri + Ṅe – ‘water’ (neuter), dative singular 

vār i + Ṅe 

 7.3.111 7.1.73  

7.3.111 gher ṅiti (guṇaḥ supi): the final vowel of a ghi base (a base ending in i or u, except  sakhi) is replaced with guṇa (here, e / o) when followed by a declensional affix marked with  Ṅ. 

7.1.73 iko’ci vibhaktau (num napuṁsakasya): augment nUM is attached to a neuter base which  ends in iK (i, u, r̥, l̥), provided a vowel-initial declensional affix follows. 

This is a case of DOI. If we apply 7.3.111 at this step, then 7.1.73 will not be applicable at the  following step. If we apply 7.1.73 at this step, then 7.3.111 will not be applicable at the  following step. This is a case of mutual blocking and thus of Type 2a (DOI conflict). 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.73 and get the correct form: vāriṇe. 

The tradition uses the vārttika, guṇavr̥ddhyauttvatr̥jvadbhāvebhyo num pūrvavipratiṣiddham (vt. 1046 on 7.1.96 striyāṁ ca) to solve this conflict. This vārttika teaches that even though the  rule teaching the attachment of the augment nUM (7.1.73) comes before the rule teaching guṇa (7.3.111) in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, the former wins. 

46 Mbh III.275.23.

59 

Having looked at examples of DOI conflict (Type 2a), now let us look at examples of DOI non conflict (Type 2b). 

(10) rājan + sU – ‘king’ (masculine), nominative singular 

 rājan + sU 

 6.4.8 6.1.68 

6.4.8 sarvanāmasthāne cāsambuddhau (nopadhāyāḥ dīrghaḥ): the penultimate sound of a base  ending in n is replaced with its dīrgha ‘long’ equivalent when a non-vocative sarvanāmasthāna affix (sU, au, Jas, am, auṬ in non-neuter forms or Śi) follows. 

6.1.68 halṅyābbhyo dīrghāt sutisyapr̥ktaṁ hal (lopaḥ): there is elision by LOPA of the finite  verb affixes ti and si, when they consist of a single sound and follow a form which ends in a  consonant, and of the nominative singular case affix sU, when it follows a form which ends in  a consonant or the long final vowel of feminine affixes Ṅī or āP. 

If 6.4.8 applies at step K, we get rājān, which still ends in a consonant. So 6.1.68 will be  applicable at the step K+1. If sU is replaced with LOPA by 6.1.68 at step K, the properties of  the affix sU still hold (cf. 1.1.62 pratyayalope pratyayalakṣaṇam), so 6.4.8 will be applicable at step K+1.  

We see that 6.4.8 and 6.1.68 do not block each other. This is a case of Type 2b (DOI non conflict). 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 6.1.68 wins and we get rājan. Now thanks to 1.1.62  pratyayalope pratyayalakṣaṇam, we apply 6.4.8 and get rājān. At this juncture, we apply 8.2.7  nalopaḥ prātipadikāntasya47, which teaches that n is replaced with LOPA at the end of a nominal stem which is termed pada, and get the correct form: rājā. 

Note that even if we had applied 6.4.8 (the LHS rule) at the first step, we could have still applied  6.1.68 at the following step. And applying these two rules in this order too would have given  us the correct form. 

47 8.2.7 is asiddha with respect to 6.4.8 and 6.1.68 so it cannot be applied before them. 

60Why then did Pāṇini need to say anything about DOI non-conflict at all? Why did he prescribe  that the RHS be applied in such cases (cf. my interpretation of 1.4.2)? We will answer this  question while discussing the following examples.  

The tradition is not interested in such cases of non-conflict.  

(11) tri + ām – ‘three’ (feminine), genitive plural 

 tri + ām 

 7.2.99 7.1.54 

7.2.99 tricaturoḥ striyāṁ tisr̥catasr̥: tri and catur are replaced with tisr̥ and catasr̥ respectively in the feminine. 

7.1.54 hrasvanadyāpo nuṭ (āmi): augment nUṬ is introduced to affix ām48 when it occurs after  a nominal base which ends in a short vowel, or is termed nadī (feminine bases ending with ī and ū), or has taken the feminine affix ṬāP. 

If we replace tri with tisr̥ at this step, 7.1.54 will still be applicable at the following step because  tisr̥ ends in a short vowel. And if we apply 7.1.54 at this step, 7.2.99 will still be applicable at  the following step, because its application does not depend on the affix. 

Neither of the two rules blocks the other, and so this is a case of Type 2b (DOI non-conflict).  By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.54 and get tri + nām. Thereafter, we  apply 7.2.99 tricaturoḥ striyāṁ tisr̥catasr̥ and get the correct form: tisr̥ṇām49. 

In order to understand why Pāṇini has prescribed that we pick the RHS rule in cases of DOI  non-conflict, let us perform this derivation again, this time by picking the LHS rule in case of  DOI non-conflict. 

48 The augment nUṬ is added at the beginning of ām by 1.1.46 ādyantau ṭakitau. 49 The r̥ of tisr̥ does not undergo elongation by 6.4.3 nāmi because this is prohibited by the following  rule 6.4.4 na tisr̥catasr̥. The n of nām becomes ṇ in tisr̥ṇām. There is no rule in the Aṣṭādhyāyī which  explicitly teaches this. However, there is a vārttika on 8.4.1 raṣābhyāṁ no ṇaḥ samānapade which  correctly teaches this operation: raṣābhyāṁ ṇatvam r̥kāragrahaṇam ‘it should be added that [not only]  after r and ṣ, [but after] r̥ [too], [n is replaced with] ṇ.’ (Mbh III.452.1-6).

61 

 tri + ām 

 7.2.99 7.1.54 

7.2.99 tricaturoḥ striyāṁ tisr̥catasr̥: same as above. 

7.1.54 hrasvanadyāpo nuṭ (āmi): same as above. 

This is a Type 2b (DOI non-conflict). As stated above, as an experiment, we are going to apply  the LHS rule 7.2.99 in this case (of DOI non-conflict). Upon applying 7.2.99, we get tisr̥ + ām.  Here, two rules are applicable: 

 tisr̥ + ām 

7.2.100 7.1.54 

7.2.100 aci ra r̥taḥ (vibhaktau tricaturoḥ tisr̥catasr̥): a r replaces r̥ of the bases tisr̥ and catasr̥,  when a vowel-initial declensional affix follows. 

7.1.54 hrasvanadyāpo nuṭ (āmi): same as above. 

If r̥ is replaced with consonant r by 7.2.100, then 7.1.54, which applies to ām when it is  preceded by certain vowel-final bases will not be applicable at the following step. And if ām takes augment nUṬ by 7.1.54, thereby becoming consonant-initial nām, then 7.2.100 which  applies to r̥ when a vowel-initial affix follows will not be applicable at the following step.  

Thus, 7.2.100 and 7.1.54 block each other. This is a case of mutual blocking, and thus of Type  2a (DOI conflict).  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS operation 7.1.54 wins, leading to the correct form:  tisṛṇām. 

We have seen that, regardless of whether we pick the LHS or the RHS rule in case of Type 2b  (DOI non-conflict) here, we get the same answer: tisr̥ṇām. However, the two derivational paths  look different from each other. The first path, in which we pick the RHS rule at the first step (as taught by Pāṇini in [my interpretation of] 1.4.2), is significantly shorter than the second  path, in which we pick the LHS rule at the first step. In other derivations too, I have noticed that the derivation looks relatively shorter when we pick the RHS rule in case of type 2b (DOI  non-conflict) and relatively longer when we pick the LHS rule.

62 

But is it merely to keep derivations compact that Pāṇini has prescribed the choice of the RHS  rule in cases of DOI non-conflict? No. In the next example, we will see that we cannot get the  correct answer without picking the RHS rule in case of DOI non-conflict. 

How does the tradition perform this derivation? Vārttikas 11 to 1450 on 7.1.96 striyāṁ ca, and  Patañjali’s comments on them, deal with this topic in detail and propose various tools like  pūrvavipratiṣiddha and apavāda to solve this problem. We will not delve into this topic here. 

(12) idam + Ṅe – ‘this’ (masculine), dative singular 

All cases of DOI in this derivation are of Type 2b (DOI non-conflict). I will not prove this at  each step.  

id a m + Ṅe 

 7.2.112 7.2.102 

7.2.112 an āpy akaḥ (vibhaktau idamaḥ idaḥ): the id of idam is substituted with an, when it  does not include a k, and when a declensional affix belonging to āP, i.e., any instrumental,  dative, ablative, genitive or locative affix, follows. 

7.2.102 tyadādīnām aḥ (vibhaktau): the final sound of a base belonging to the group headed by  tyad ‘that’ is replaced with a when a declensional affix follows. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 7.2.102 wins, and we get: ida-a + Ṅe. Here,  multiple rules are applicable: 

id [ a-a ] + Ṅe 

 7.2.112 6.1.97 7.1.14 

7.2.112 an āpy akaḥ (vibhaktau idamaḥ idaḥ): same as above. 

6.1.97 ato guṇe: when a short a, which is not pada-final (word-final) is followed by a guṇa vowel i.e., a, e, or o, then both a and the following guṇa are replaced with the latter. 

50 Mbh III.276.6-22.

63 

7.1.14 sarvanāmnaḥ smai (ṅer yaḥ ataḥ): the affix Ṅe, when occurring after a pronominal base  ending in a, is replaced with smai. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right-most rule 7.1.14, and get ida-a + smai. Here,  multiple rules are applicable: 

id [ a-a ] + smai  

 7.2.112 7.2.113 6.1.97 

7.2.112 an āpy akaḥ (vibhaktau idamaḥ idaḥ): the id of idam is substituted with an, when it  does not include a k, and when a declensional affix belonging to āP, i.e., any instrumental,  dative, ablative, genitive or locative affix, follows. 

7.2.113 hali lopaḥ (vibhaktau idamaḥ idaḥ akaḥ): the id of idam is replaced with LOPA, when  it does not include a k, and when a consonant-initial declensional affix belonging to āP, i.e., any instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive or locative affix, follows. 

6.1.97 ato guṇe: same as above. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.1.97 and get ida + smai. Here multiple  rules are applicable: 

 id a + smai 

 7.2.112 7.2.113  

We see that there is a case of SOI between 7.2.112 and 7.2.113. Because 7.2.113 applies only  when the base is followed by a consonant initial affix, it is more specific than, and defeats  7.2.112. Thus, we get the correct form: asmai. 

At the very first step of this derivation, where we see the two rules 7.2.112 and 7.2.102 involved  in DOI non-conflict, if we had chosen to apply the LHS rule 7.2.112 instead of the RHS rule  7.2.102, we would have got the wrong form at the end of the derivation: *anasmai. The same  can be said about the second step too: picking 7.2.112 at the second step instead of 7.1.14 too  would have given us the wrong form: *anasmai.  

This shows that, even though whether we choose the LHS rule or the RHS rule may not matter  in certain cases of DOI non-conflict (see examples 10 and 11 above), in cases of DOI non conflict like this one, choosing the RHS rule alone gives the correct answer. 

64 

Finally, let us look at an example which involves cases of both DOI conflict and DOI non conflict. 

(13) asmad + sU – ‘I’ (any gender), nominative singular 

asma d + sU 

 7.2.94 7.2.86 7.1.28 

7.2.94 tvāhau sau (yuṣmadasmador maparyantasya vibhaktau): the parts of yuṣmad and asmad  extending up to ma51 are replaced with tva and aha respectively when followed by the case  affix sU. 

7.2.86 yuṣmadasmador anādeśe (vibhaktau āḥ): the final sounds of yuṣmad and asmad are  replaced with ā when followed by consonant-initial case affixes which have not undergone any  substitution.  

7.1.28 ṅeprathamayor am (yuṣmadasmadbhyāṁ vibhaktau): Ṅe, and nominative, accusative  affixes are replaced with am when preceded by yuṣmad and asmad. 

Let us determine the relationship between 7.2.94 and the two other rules.  

If we apply 7.2.94 at this step, 7.2.86 will be applicable at the following step. Similarly, if we  apply 7.2.86 at this step, 7.2.94 will be applicable at the following step. There is a Type 2b  (DOI non-blocking) relationship between 7.2.94 and 7.2.86.  

Similarly, if we apply 7.2.94 at this step, 7.1.28 will be applicable at the following step. If we  apply 7.1.28 at this step, 7.2.94 will be applicable at the following step.52 There is a Type 2b  (DOI non-blocking) relationship between 7.2.94 and 7.1.28.  

51 The tradition translates maparyantasya as ‘up to m’ but I think that Pāṇini means ‘up to ma’. Both  interpretations lead to correct answers for all forms of yuṣmad-asmad. My interpretation makes  derivations simpler and shorter.  

52 Given that sU has been replaced with am, how will 7.2.94 apply at the following step? This is because,  by 1.1.56 sthānivadādeśo’nalvidhau, am is treated like sU. How do we know this is not an aL-vidhi?  asma and am are not adjacent to each other (d sits in the middle of the two), and so this is not an aL  operation.

65 

Thus 7.2.94 has a Type 2b (DOI non-conflict) with the other two rules.  

Now let us determine the relationship between 7.2.86 and 7.1.28. If we apply 7.2.86 at this  step, 7.1.28 will still be applicable at the following step. However, if we apply 7.1.28 at this  step, then the affix sU will undergo ādeśa ‘substitution’ with am. 7.2.86 can only apply to  asmad when followed by a non-substituted, consonant-initial affix. Thus, 7.2.86 will not be  applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of Type 2a  (DOI conflict). 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right-most rule 7.1.28 and get: asmad + am. Here  again, two rules are applicable: 

asma d + am 

 7.2.94 7.2.90 

7.2.90 śeṣe lopaḥ: the final sounds of yuṣmad and asmad are replaced with LOPA when  followed by case affixes not listed in the preceding rules (7.2.86-89).53 

If we apply 7.2.94 at this step, 7.2.90 will still be applicable at the following step. If we apply  7.2.90 at this step, 7.2.94 will be applicable at the following step. This is a case of no blocking,  and thus of Type 2b (DOI non-conflict). By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.2.90 and get asma + am. Lastly, we apply 7.2.94 and get aha + am, to which we apply 6.1.97  ato guṇe.54 This gives the correct form: aham. 

As stated in a footnote on 7.2.94, the traditional interpretation of 7.2.94 is different from mine.  Thus, its derivational process is different and slightly longer. We will not delve into it here. I  will simply say that the tradition would have resolved the DOI conflict in this example using  the nitya tool. 

53 Note that, here, the affix sU has undergone ādeśa ‘substitution’ with am. So, 7.2.86, which can only  apply to asmad when followed by a non-substituted and consonant initial affix, and which was  applicable in the previous step, is no longer applicable at this step. Instead of that rule, 7.2.90 has  become applicable. 

54 An a which is not at the end of a pada and the guṇa vowel following it are both replaced with the  latter.

66 

This brings us to the end of examples of DOI in this chapter. We will, of course, study more  examples of DOI conflict in later chapters. Before we go to the next section, here I want to  emphasize that I have discussed blocking and conflict in these derivations only because post Pāṇinian scholarship is interested in these topics. In other words, I have attempted to show that  examples of conflict can be solved by my interpretation of 1.4.2.  

Note that, if we had simply avoided talking about blocking and conflict, we would have  completed these derivations almost effortlessly, by simply picking the right-most rule (cf. my  interpretation of 1.4.2) in every case of DOI, irrespective of whether or not the rules in question are involved in any kind of conflict. 

### 2.8 Examples of SOI 

Having discussed examples of DOI, I will now show, through the following examples, that my  solution (i.e., the more specific rule wins) helps deal with cases of SOI. Note that we find very  few examples of RE 5 (SOI non-conflict) in Pāṇinian derivations. These cases are neither  particularly challenging nor of interest to the tradition. Thus, I will only discuss cases of  conflict here. To avoid redundancy, I will refrain from reiterating or proving the existence of  conflict in these examples. I will also develop a systematic procedure to identify which rule is  more specific. At the end of each example, I will mention the traditional solution. 

Type 1 (SOI)  

unidirectional blocking (RE 1) mutual blocking (RE 2) no blocking (RE 5) 

 SOI conflict SOI non-conflict   

My solution: the rule which is more specific (i.e., the exception rule) wins

67 

(1) rāma + bhyas – ‘Rāma’ (masculine), dative plural 

 rāma + bhyas 

 7.3.102 7.3.103 

7.3.102 supi ca (ato dīrgho yañi): the a at the end of a nominal base is replaced with its long  equivalent when followed by a declensional affix starting with yaÑ (i.e., y, v, r l, jh, bh or any  nasal). 

7.3.103 bahuvacane jhaly et (ataḥ supi): the a at the end of a nominal base is replaced with e when followed by a plural declensional affix starting with jhaL (any non-nasal stop or  fricative).  

Note that the sets of operands of both rules are exactly the same, namely the final a of a nominal  stem. 

final a of a nominal stem

operands of 7.3.102 = operands of 7.3.103 

However, the sets of contexts of the two rules are different. Neither set is a subset of the other.  Instead, the two sets intersect each other.  

68 

other case affixes  starting with  

y, v, r, l, ñ, m, ṅ, ṇ, n, jh, bh

with jh or  bh

plural case affixes  starting with

 contexts of 7.3.102 contexts of 7.3.103 

So how do we decide which rule is ‘more specific?’ Let us develop a procedure that we can use to deal with all examples of SOI. 

Each Pāṇinian rule actually represents a collection of one or more sub-rules. For example,  consider 7.3.102 which teaches that  

a& + yaÑ ! 🡪 ā& + yaÑ ! 

[& = end of nominal stem; ! = beginning of case affix] 

7.3.102 represents the following collection of sub-rules: 

1. a& + y!🡪 ā& + y! 

2. a& + v!🡪 ā& + v! 

3. a& + r!🡪 ā& + r! 

4. a& + l!🡪 ā& + l! 

5. a& + ñ!🡪 ā& + ñ! 

6. a& + m!🡪 ā& + m! 

7. a& + ṅ!🡪 ā& + ṅ! 

8. a& +ṇ!🡪 ā& + ṇ! 

69 

9. a& + n!🡪 ā& + n! 

10. a& + jh!🡪 ā& + jh! 

11. a& + bh!🡪 ā& + bh! 

Pāṇini teaches these 11 sub-rules together in the form of the rule 7.3.102, using his pratyāhāra system, purely for the sake of brevity. Similarly, let us deconstruct 7.3.103 which teaches: 

a& + jhaL! #🡪 e & + jhaL! # 

[& = end of nominal stem; ! = beginning of case affix; # = plural] 

7.3.103 can be represented by the following collection of sub-rules: 

1. a& + jh! #🡪 e & + jh! # 

2. a& + bh! #🡪 e & + bh! # 

3. a& + gh! #🡪 e & + gh! # 

4. a& + ḍh! #🡪 e & + ḍh! # 

5. a& + dh! #🡪 e & + dh! # 

…and so on. 

Note that two sub-rules from the collection represented by 7.3.102 namely 11 and 12, which I  have underlined, look similar to their respective underlined counterparts in the collection  represented by 7.3.103. The actual SOI takes place between these two pairs of sub-rules. In  fact, when I say that the more specific rule prevails in case of SOI, I mean, the more specific  ‘subrule’ prevails.  

The other (non-underlined) subrules just happen to be represented by 7.3.102 and 7.3.103  respectively and are actually completely irrelevant to the SOI at hand.  

We know that jh is not present at the beginning of any case affix, so we will focus on the sub rules which apply to the final a of nominal stems when they are followed by bh-initial case  affixes.

Relevant subrule of 7.3.102 

	Relevant subrule of 7.3.103

	11. a& + bh!🡪 ā& + bh! 

	2. a& + bh! #🡪 e & + bh! #

	







70Note that we find an extra # symbol in case of sub-rule 2 under 7.3.103. This # stands for plural.  Therefore, we conclude that subrule 2 under 7.3.103 is more specific than sub-rule 11 under  7.3.102 and thus wins. Henceforth, I shall take the liberty to rephrase this as ‘7.3.103 is more  specific than 7.3.102 and thus wins’.  

I will discuss this detailed procedure for the next example too. But after that, to avoid  redundancy, I will present this procedure in an abbreviated form for all examples of SOI in this  thesis. I will now present the abbreviated form of the procedure discussed above for the present  example. 

Let us consider the conditions in which each of the two rules 7.3.102 and 7.3.103 apply. Note  that here I draw a distinction between a rule and a condition: a rule can apply in multiple  conditions. This clarification is important insofar as the exact conditions in which a rule applies  can vary, as I will show below.  

7.3.102 applies to: 

base ending in a + declensional affix starting with bh 

base ending in a + declensional affix starting with any other sound of yaÑ 7.3.103 applies to: 

base ending in a + declensional affix starting with bh (plural)  

base ending in a + declensional affix starting with any other sound of jhaL (plural) 

Notice that I write sounds, for example, a, bh, yaÑ, jhaL etc., outside of brackets and all their  characteristics such as being a plural affix, being a neuter base etc. inside brackets. I treat  sounds and their characteristics as two distinct sources of information. Broadly speaking, I will  follow this convention for all examples of SOI discussed throughout this thesis.  

In every case of SOI, only one condition per rule is relevant to the conflict. I mark the relevant  conditions by writing them in bold fonts, as can be seen above. I will do the same for the rest  of the examples. We compare the two and determine which one is more specific.  

Here the rule including the condition ‘in the plural’ (bahuvacane) is more specific than the  other rule, which has no restriction based on number. So, the rule teaching the operation  reserved for the plural, that is rule 7.3.103, wins, leading to the correct form: rāmebhyaḥ.

71 

The Mahābhāṣya55 on 7.3.103 and the Kāśikā on 1.4.2 state that both 7.3.102 and 7.3.103 are  sāvakāśa: 7.3.102 applies in derivations of forms like vr̥kṣābhyām and plakṣābhyām, and  7.3.103 applies in derivations of forms like vr̥kṣeṣu and plakṣeṣu. As stated before, Kātyāyana  teaches that vipratiṣedha takes place between two sāvakāśa rules. Thus, by the traditional  interpretation of 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam, the rule which comes later in the serial order  of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, namely 7.3.103, wins.  

(2) Now let us consider the sandhi between the two words of the compound rāmaudārya  ‘Rāma’s generosity’. We will not look at how this compound is formed, confining ourselves to  the relevant step of the derivation: 

rām[a + au]dārya 

 6.1.87 6.1.88 

6.1.87 ād guṇaḥ (aci): guṇa (a, e, o) replaces both a and the vowel immediately following it. 

6.1.88 vr̥ddhir eci (āt): vr̥ddhi (ā, ai, au) replaces both a and the eC vowel (e, o, ai, au)  immediately following it.56 

6.1.87 which teaches that 

a + aC 🡪 a / e / o 

can be rewritten as the following collection of sub-rules: 

a + a 🡪 a 

a + i 🡪 e 

a + u 🡪 o 

a + r̥ 🡪 a 

55 Mbh III.340.1-5. 

56 Note that both 6.1.87 and 6.1.88 belong to the ekādeśa-adhikāra i.e., the section headed by the sūtra  6.1.84 ekaḥ pūrvaparayoḥ which teaches that both the LHS and the RHS item are replaced with a single  substitute.

72 

a + l̥ 🡪 a 

a + e 🡪 e 

a + o 🡪 o 

a + ai 🡪 e 

a + au 🡪 o 

6.1.88 which teaches that 

a + eC 🡪 ā / ai / au 

can be rewritten as the following collection of sub-rules: 

a + e 🡪 ai 

a + o 🡪 au 

a + ai 🡪 ai 

a + au 🡪 au 

Note that the four underlined subrules under 6.1.87 correspond with the four underlined  subrules under 6.1.88 respectively. However, both groups of underlined sub-rules are applicable in exactly the same four conditions, namely a + e, a + o, a + ai and a + au,  respectively. In such a case how can we decide which one is more specific? Since we cannot  use sub-rules alone to make this decision, we need to look at the rules themselves. Even though  6.1.87 already deals with these four conditions, among other conditions, Pāṇini composed  6.1.88 exclusively to deal with these four conditions. This tells that Pāṇini wants us to apply  6.1.88, and not 6.1.87 in this example.  

In the remaining examples I will present only abbreviated versions of this procedure, as  follows: 

6.1.87: 

a + e/ai/o/au 

a + any other vowel 

6.1.88: 

a + e/o/ai/au

73 

Unlike example 1, where one condition was slightly different from the other (by virtue of being  marked with the grammatical restriction ‘plural’), in this example, both conditions highlighted  in bold are exactly the same i.e., a + e/ai/o/au. In such a case, we go a step further and compare  the two rules themselves. 6.1.88 applies only to a + e/ai/o/au whereas 6.1.87 also applies to a 

+ any other vowel. Thus 6.1.88 is more specific and wins the SOI, giving us the correct form:  rāmaudārya. 

On 6.1.88, the Kāśikā says that 6.1.88 is an apavāda of, and thus wins against, 6.1.87. Even  though the tradition does not explicitly define apavāda, I think that the tradition uses the  apavāda tool in cases of SOI, when, for example, the conditions in which one rule, here 6.1.88, applies (cf. a + e/ai/o/au), clearly constitute a subset of the conditions in which the other rule,  here 6.1.87, applies (cf. a + any vowel). In many such cases, the apavāda rule is taught in the  close vicinity of, and often immediately after, the utsarga rule, in the serial order of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī. For example, the apavāda sūtra 6.1.88 is taught right after the utsarga sūtra 6.1.87.  

(3) Let us look at the sandhi between two padas, i.e., words, tava ‘your’ and ānandam ‘happiness’. This example is similar to example 2. Two rules are simultaneously applicable to  a + ā: 

 tav[a + ā]nandam 

 6.1.87 6.1.101 

6.1.87 ād guṇaḥ (aci): guṇa (a, e, o) replaces both a and the vowel immediately following it. 

6.1.101 akaḥ savarṇe dīrghaḥ: a long vowel replaces both aK (a, i, u, r̥, l̥) and the immediately  following savarṇa ‘homogeneous’ vowel. 

6.1.101: 

a + savarṇa 

i / u / r̥ / l̥ + savarṇa 

6.1.87: 

a + savarṇa 

a + any other vowel

74 

Here too, like in example 2, the conditions highlighted in bold are exactly the same. So, we  have to compare the two rules themselves.  

However, here, this too seems difficult. Thus, we have to eliminate those conditions which are  completely irrelevant to the SOI at hand, namely ‘i / u / r̥ / l̥ + savarṇa’. It is likely that Pāṇini  combined this condition with ‘a + savarṇa’ purely for the sake of brevity. So, we omit it from  the comparison.  

6.1.101 applies only to cases of ‘a + savarṇa’ whereas 6.1.87 applies to ‘a + any other vowel’  as well. Thus, we conclude that 6.1.101 is more specific and wins, thereby leading to the correct  form: tavānandam.57 To the best of my knowledge the tradition does not mention this conflict.  I suppose it would use its interpretation of 1.4.2 to resolve it.  

(4) Now let us consider an example similar to example 2. We will derive the genitive plural of  the feminine form of tri ‘three’. 

tri + ām 

 7.1.53 7.2.99  

57 I must admit that my method is able to tackle other examples with greater ease as compared to this  one. Here, I am compelled to add an extra step i.e., that of excluding the condition ‘i / u / r̥ / l̥ + savarṇa’  from the comparison. Perhaps we could attach greater value to Pāṇini’s use of the term savarṇa and  characterize this SOI as follows: 

6.1.101: 

a + vowel (savarṇa) 

i / u / r̥ / l̥ + vowel (savarṇa) 

6.1.87: 

a + vowel 

I have written the conditions that are relevant to the conflict in bold. 6.1.101 is applicable only when  the following vowel is a savarṇa. Thus, it is more specific and wins.

75 

7.1.53 tres trayaḥ (āmi): the base tri is replaced with traya when ām follows. 

7.2.99 tricaturoḥ striyāṁ tisr̥catasr̥ (vibhaktau): tri and catur are replaced with tisr̥ and catasr̥ respectively in the feminine when a declensional affix follows. 

7.1.53: 

tri + ām 

7.2.99: 

tri (feminine) + ām 

tri (feminine) + any other declensional affix 

catur (feminine) + any declensional affix 

I have written the conditions that are relevant to the conflict in bold. 7.2.99 is applicable only  to the feminine tri base, whereas 7.1.53 is applicable to the base in all genders. 7.2.99 is more  specific and thus wins, thereby giving us the correct form: tisr̥ṇām. 

To the best of my knowledge the tradition does not mention this conflict. I suppose it would  use its interpretation of 1.4.2 to resolve it.  

Note that in the four examples above, (1) and (4) are similar to each other, and (2) and (3) are  similar to each other.  

In both (1) and (4), the two conditions (in bold) involved in the SOI are not exactly the same.  One operation is conditioned by a grammatical specification (‘plural’ in example 1 and  ‘feminine’ in example 4), while the other is not. The operation conditioned by the grammatical  specification (which is often morphological) wins.  

On the other hand, in the case of examples (2) and (3), the conditions highlighted in bold are  exactly the same, and thus we have to go a step further and compare the two rules themselves.  

For clarity, let us give names to these two types: we will call examples 1 and 4 SOI-L and  examples 2 and 3 SOI-M. The primary definition of SOI-L is that it can be resolved at the first  step of comparison: the conditions highlighted in bold are not exactly the same, and so the one  which has a specific restriction or marker (e.g., plural) wins. The choice of the winning rule  can be made at the first step of comparison itself, i.e., by comparing conditions.

76 

On the other hand, SOI-M cases are defined as those where the conditions highlighted in bold  are exactly the same, and so we cannot decide which one is more specific. We need to go a step  further and compare the two rules themselves to determine the winning rule.  

(5) Now let us look at the sandhi-related step of the derivation of the compound bhānūdaya  ‘sunrise’: 

bhānu + udaya 

Here the following two rules are applicable: 

6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci: iK (i, u, r̥, l̥) is replaced with yaṆ (y, v, r, l) when aC (any vowel) follows. 

6.1.101 akaḥ savarṇe dīrghaḥ (aci): a long vowel replaces both aK (a, i, u, r̥, l̥) and the  following savarṇa ‘homogeneous’ vowel. 

However, the problem is that they do not have exactly the same operand. Here I use round  brackets to indicate the operand of 6.1.77 and square brackets to indicate the operand of  6.1.101: 

bhān[(u) + u]daya 

The operand of 6.1.77 is inside the operand of 6.1.101. How do we solve such an example? I  propose that we treat u + u as the operand of both rules. This means that we have to reanalyse  rule 6.1.77: instead of saying that iK is replaced with yaṆ when aC follows, we say that iK + aC is replaced with yaṆ + aC.58  

Now that both rules have the same operand, we can choose the rule that is more specific.  6.1.77: 

u + savarṇa 

u + any other vowel 

i / r̥ / l̥ + any vowel 

58 Another way of comparing the two rules is to simply compare the RHS item of each. For example,  for 6.1.77, the RHS item is aC (any vowel) while for 6.1.101, it is specifically a savarṇa sound. This  leads us to the correct conclusion that 6.1.101 is more specific than 6.1.77. 

77 

6.1.101  

u + savarṇa 

a / i / r̥ / l̥ + savarṇa 

The conditions in bold are exactly the same. This is a case of SOI-M. Thus, we need to compare  the two rules.  

Note that the conditions ‘i / r̥ / l̥ + any vowel’ (under 6.1.77) and ‘a / i / r̥ / l̥ + savarṇa’ (under  6.1.101) are not relevant here because our operand is u + u. So, we won’t take these conditions into account. 6.1.77 applies to cases in which u is followed by any vowel. On the other hand,  6.1.101 applies only to those cases in which u is followed by a savarṇa. 6.1.101 is more specific  and thus wins, leading to the correct form: bhānūdaya. 

To the best of my knowledge the tradition does not mention this conflict. I suppose it would  use its interpretation of 1.4.2 to resolve it.  

(6) vana + sU – ‘forest’ (neuter), nominative singular 

 vana + sU 

 7.1.23 7.1.24 

7.1.23 svamor napuṁsakāt (luk): affixes sU and am occurring after a neuter base are replaced with LUK. 

7.1.24 ato’m (svamor napuṁsakāt): affixes sU and am occurring after a neuter base ending in  a are replaced with am. 

7.1.23 

-a (neuter) + sU / am 

- any other sound (neuter) + sU / am 

7.1.24 

-a (neuter) + sU / am

78 

The conditions in bold are exactly the same. This is a case of SOI-M. Thus, we now compare  the rules. Both rules are meant for sU and am affixes added to neuter bases, but 7.1.24 is  specifically meant for those cases in which sU and am are preceded by a base ending in a. 7.1.24 is more specific and thus wins, leading to the correct form: vanam. 

On 7.1.24, the Kāśikā says that 7.1.24 is an apavāda of, and thus wins against, 7.1.23. 

(7) yuṣmad + bhyas – ‘you’ (any gender), ablative plural 

yuṣmad + bhyas 

 7.1.30 7.1.31 

7.1.30 bhyaso bhyam (yuṣmadasmadbhyām): the affix bhyas which occurs after the bases  yuṣmad and asmad is replaced with bhyam. 

7.1.31 pañcamyā at (yuṣmadasmadbhyām bhyaso): the ablative affix bhyas which occurs after  the bases yuṣmad and asmad is replaced with at. 

7.1.30 

yuṣmad / asmad + bhyas 

7.1.31 

yuṣmad / asmad + bhyas (ablative) 

Note that bhyas is a plural affix used for both dative and ablative forms. 7.1.31 is specifically  about the ablative bhyas. This is a case of SOI-L. 7.1.73 is more specific because it mentions  the ablative, and thus wins, leading to the correct form: yuṣmat.  

On 7.1.31, the Nyāsa says that 7.1.31 is an apavāda of, and thus wins against, 7.1.30. 

(8) eka + Ṅe – ‘one’ (masculine), dative singular 

eka + Ṅe 

 7.1.13 7.1.14

79 

7.1.13 ṅer yaḥ (ataḥ): the affix Ṅe, when occurring after a base ending in a, is replaced with ya. 

7.1.14 sarvanāmnaḥ smai (ṅer yaḥ ataḥ)59: the affix Ṅe, when occurring after a pronominal  base ending in a, is replaced with smai. 

7.1.13  

a + Ṅe  

7.1.14 

a (pronoun) + Ṅe  

This is a case of SOI-L. 7.1.14 concerns only pronominal bases. Thus, it is more specific and  wins, leading to the correct form: ekasmai. 

To the best of my knowledge the tradition does not mention this conflict. I suppose it would  use the apavāda tool to solve it.  

(9) hari + au – ‘green’ (masculine) nominative dual 

hari + au 

The two rules that are applicable here are: 

6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci: iK (i, u, r̥, l̥) is replaced with yaṆ (y, v, r, l) when aC (vowel) follows. 

6.1.102 prathamayoḥ pūrvasavarṇaḥ (aci akaḥ dīrghaḥ): aK (a, i, u, r̥, l̥) and the following  vowel which constitutes the first sound of nominative and accusative affixes, are both replaced  with a long vowel which is homogeneous with the sound on the left-hand side. 

Note that, here too, like in example 5 of this section, the operand of one rule is inside the  operand of another. We overcome this problem just as we did in example 5.  

6.1.77  

i / u/ r̥ / l̥ + any vowel 

59 The base eka is listed in the sarvādigaṇa, referred to in 1.1.27 sarvādīni sarvanāmāni.

806.1.102 

a + any vowel (nominative / accusative) 

i / u/ r̥ / l̥ + any vowel (nominative / accusative) 

This is a case of SOI-L. 6.1.102 is more specific and thus wins, leading to the correct form:  harī. 

To the best of my knowledge the tradition does not mention this conflict. I suppose it would  use its interpretation of 1.4.2 to solve it.  

(10) vāri + Ṅi – ‘water (neuter)’ locative singular 

Let us look at the rules that apply: 

7.3.116 ṅer ām nadyāmnībhyaḥ 

7.3.117 idudbhyām 

7.3.118 aut 

7.3.119 ac ca gheḥ 

Kielhorn60 shows that 7.3.117-7.3.119 together originally constituted one sūtra: idudbhyām  aud ac ca gheḥ. Kātyāyana split it into two: idudbhyām and aud ac ca gheh, and Patañjali  further split the latter into two: aut and ac ca gheḥ. I accept the original version taught by Pāṇini  himself: 7.3.117 idudbhyām aud ac ca gheḥ.  

Now, in vāri + Ṅi, two rules are applicable: 

 vāri + Ṅi   

 7.3.117 7.1.73 7.3.117 7.1.73 iko’ci vibhaktau (num napuṁsakasya): augment nUM is attached to a neuter iK-final  (ending in i, u, r̥, l) base when a vowel-initial declensional affix follows.’  

60 See Staal’s ‘A Reader on the Sanskrit Grammarians’ (1972: 115).

81 

7.3.117 idudbhyām aut ac ca gheḥ (ṅer): after ghi bases, Ṅi is replaced with au, and the final  sound of the base is replaced with a.  

Note that 7.3.117 is unusual because it teaches two operations together. And curiously, we can  say that the operand of 7.1.73 lies between the two operands of 7.3.117. We cannot treat this  as a case of DOI, so we have to treat this as a case of SOI. 

7.1.73 applies to: 

i/u (neuter) + Ṅi 

i/u (neuter) + other vowel initial affixes  

r̥/l̥ (neuter) + vowel initial affixes  

7.3.117 applies to: 

i/u + Ṅi 

This is a case of SOI-L and the condition which is marked ‘neuter’ is more specific and thus  wins, giving us the correct form vāriṇi.  

The tradition uses the vārttika, guṇavr̥ddhyauttvatr̥jvadbhāvebhyo num pūrvavipratiṣiddham (vt. 1061 on 7.1.96 striyāṁ ca), to solve this conflict. This vārttika teaches that even though the  rule teaching the attachment of the augment nUM (7.1.73) comes before the rule teaching  auttva (7.3.117 idudbhyām aud ac ca gheḥ) in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, the former  wins.

## 
Chapter Three 

### 3.1 Challenges1 

In the previous chapter, I introduced my solution to the problem of rule interaction at the same  step. In this chapter, I will discuss the relationship of my solution with other aspects of the  functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. 

Let us look at two examples of DOI from nominal inflection which pose a challenge to my  interpretation of 1.4.2. In these two cases, it can be argued that the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s derivational  machine does not follow its own algorithm.2 

Like in the previous chapter, I will first prove that the example involves conflict, given the  interest of the post-Pāṇinian discourse in the subject of conflict, and will also discuss both my  solution and the traditional solution thereafter. 

(1) tri + ām – ‘three’ (masculine), genitive plural 

tri + ām 

 7.1.53 7.1.54 

7.1.53 tres trayaḥ: tri is replaced with traya when ām follows. 

7.1.54 hrasvanadyāpo nuṭ: augment nUṬ is introduced to affix ām when it occurs after a base which ends in a short vowel (hrasvānta), or in a form which is termed nadī (nadyanta), or else,  ends in the feminine affix āP (ābanta).  

If we apply 7.1.53 at this step, we get traya + ām, to which 7.1.54 will be applicable. If we  apply 7.1.54 at this step, we get tri + nām, to which 7.1.53 will not be applicable. This is  because 7.1.53 is applicable to tri if it is followed by ām, not nām.  

This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of Type 2a (DOI conflict).  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 7.1.54 wins and we get: tri + nām (7.1.54) 🡪 trīnām (6.4.3 nāmi) 🡪 *trīṇām (8.4.2 aṭkupvāṅnumvyavāye’pi), which is not the correct form.  

1 In this chapter, and in the following chapters, I will not provide anuvr̥tta ‘continued’ terms in brackets (unless necessary), even though I did this in the previous chapters. 

2 These are the only two exceptions of my interpretation of 1.4.2 known to me.

83 

To get the correct answer, we must apply 7.1.53 here: traya + ām (7.1.53) 🡪 traya + nām (7.1.54) 🡪 trayānām (6.4.3 nāmi) 🡪 trayāṇām (8.4.2 aṭkupvāṅnumvyavāye’pi). 

To the best of my knowledge, the tradition does not say anything on this matter.  

As seen above, my interpretation of 1.4.2 does not give us the correct answer here. I have not  found a convincing way to explain this phenomenon. However, below, I present a purely  speculative and unsubstantiated explanation. Further research needs to be done to understand  this issue better. 

We know that Pāṇini was familiar with the form trayāṇām because he uses it in his rule 7.4.75  nijāṁ trayāṇāṁ guṇaḥ ślau “a guṇa vowel replaces the abhyāsa of a base constituted by the  list of three roots beginning with nijIR ‘to cleanse, nourish’ when ŚLU follows”. However, he  may also have been familiar with the form trīṇām: even though trīṇām is not to be found in  classical Sanskrit, it is in fact used in Vedic Sanskrit: trīṇām api samudrāṇām ‘also of the three  oceans’3. It is possible that when Pāṇini composed the Aṣṭādhyāyī, or at least its first layer of  rules, both trīṇām and trayāṇām were acceptable as genitive plural form of tri (masculine) in  bhāṣā ‘everyday Sanskrit’. So, even though he uses the form (trayāṇām) in his sūtra, perhaps  he wanted to teach the derivation of the other acceptable form (trīṇām). 

In the course of time, as the language underwent further change, trīṇām got fully replaced with  trayāṇām.4 And to accommodate this change, it is possible that a later scholar added the sūtra 7.1.53 tres trayaḥ to the Aṣṭādhyāyī. This scholar may not have known the actual meaning of  1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam, which is perhaps why he did not realize that this would create  a problem. 

In fact, we do find a very similar and related example of language change reflected in Pāṇini’s own rules. Consider the genitive plural of tri (feminine): tri + ām. As shown in example 2 of  section 2.3, after performing some operations, we get tisr̥ + nām. Here, 6.4.3 nāmi, which  teaches the elongation of r̥, is not applicable, thanks to 6.4.4 na tisr̥catasr̥, which forbids us  from applying 6.4.3 vis-à-vis tisr̥ and catasr̥. However, the next rule 6.4.5 chandasy ubhayathā teaches that, when constructing the Vedic form, one can optionally elongate r̥ in the genitive  

3 This example has been given in the Kāśikā on 7.1.53. Another example is: mahi trīṇām avo’stu  dyukṣam mitrasyāryamṇaḥ (Maṇḍala 10, Sūkta 185, R̥k 1). 

4 Observe its similarity with trayaḥ, the nominative plural form of tri (masculine). It is likely that the  presence of traya here rubbed off on the genitive plural.

84 

plural of tri (feminine). This gives us two acceptable Vedic forms: tisr̥ṇām and tisr̥̄ṇām. It is  likely that when Pāṇini composed the Aṣṭādhyāyī, the older version, tisr̥̄ṇām was becoming  obsolete and simultaneously making way for the newer version tisr̥ṇām.  

Similarly, it seems plausible that, in order to register the change from trīṇām to trayāṇām in  the Aṣṭādhyāyī, or put differently, to update the Aṣṭādhyāyī, someone added the sūtra 7.1.53  tres trayaḥ to it. 7.1.53 tres trayaḥ must have been placed after 7.1.52 āmi sarvanāmnaḥ suṭ to  continue āmi into 7.1.53 by anuvr̥tti. But observe how oddly located it is – a substitution rule  in the midst of augment insertion rules.

We also have another reason to believe that 7.1.53 might be an interpolation. Consider Pāṇini’s rule 6.4.3 nāmi (dīrghaḥ). If he had said āmi dīrghaḥ instead of nāmi dīrghaḥ, then in deva +  ām, two rules would have been simultaneously applicable: 

deva + ām 

 āmi (dīrghaḥ) hrasvanadyāpo nuṭ 

Both rules would block each other. This is a Type 2a interaction (DOI conflict). By my  interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule would win leading to rāmanām 🡪 *rāmaṇām (8.4.2  aṭkupvāṅnumvyavāye’pi), which is not the correct form. It is for this reason that Pāṇini said  nāmi and not āmi, thereby requiring us to add the nUṬ augment first and to lengthen the vowel  after doing so. Since Pāṇini was careful enough about this derivation, he would also have been  careful about the derivation of trayāṇām – that is, if he had wanted to derive this form – which  also deals with ām and nuḍāgama. 

If Pāṇini had wanted to derive the word trayāṇām, I think he would have come up with a rule  similar in style to 6.4.3 nāmi (dīrghaḥ): tres trayaḥ nāmi. The derivation would have proceeded 

85 

as follows: tri + ām 🡪 tri + nām (7.1.54 hrasvanadyāpo nuṭ). At this juncture there would  arise an SOI conflict between 6.4.3 nāmi and tres trayaḥ nāmi. The latter would win by virtue  of being more specific, and we would get the correct form: trayāṇām (8.4.2 aṭkupvāṅnumvyavāye’pi). This suggests that Pāṇini may not be the composer of 7.1.53 tres  trayaḥ. 

To conclude, as stated before, it is possible that when Pāṇini composed the Aṣṭādhyāyī, or at  least its first layer of rules, both trīṇām and trayāṇām were acceptable as genitive plural form  of tri (masculine) in bhāṣā ‘everyday Sanskrit’. It is possible that Pāṇini, despite using the form  trayāṇām in his rule, taught us the derivation of trīṇām, while a later scholar added the rule  7.1.53 tres trayaḥ to the Aṣṭādhyāyī to facilitate the derivation of trayāṇām.  

However, I admit it is odd that Pāṇini would use one form (trayāṇām) in his sūtra but would  teach the derivation of the other acceptable form (trīṇām), therefore this matter will require  further consideration.  

(2) bhavatU + sU – ‘Sir’ (masculine), nominative singular 

bhav a t + sU 

  

 6.4.14 7.1.70 6.1.68 

6.4.14 atvasantasya cādhātoḥ: the vowel, which is the penultimate sound of a base which ends  in atU or as but is not a verbal root, is replaced with its long counterpart when the non sambuddhi ending sU follows.  

7.1.70 ugidacāṁ sarvanāmasthāne’dhātoḥ: augment nUM is introduced to a base which is not  a verbal root but is marked with UK (U, R̥, L̥), and also to a base constituted by verbal root  añcU, when an affix termed sarvanāmasthāna follows. 

6.1.68 halṅyābbhyo dīrghāt sutisyapr̥ktaṁ hal: there is elision by LOPA of the finite verb  affixes ti and si, when they consist of a single sound and follow a form which ends in a  consonant, and of the nominative singular case affix sU, when it follows a form which ends in  a consonant or the long final vowel of feminine affixes Ṅī or āP.

86 

If we apply 6.1.68 at this step, both 6.4.14 and 7.1.70 will potentially be applicable at the  following step, thanks to 1.1.62 pratyayalope pratyayalakṣaṇam5. Similarly, even after 6.4.14  and 7.1.70 have been applied, the stem will still end in the consonant t, so 6.1.68 will be  applicable at the following step. So, 6.1.68 neither blocks nor is blocked by the other two rules,  and thus shares a Type 2b (DOI non-conflict) relationship with them.  

Now let us look at the relationship between 6.4.14 and 7.1.70. If we apply 6.4.14 at this step,  then 7.1.70 which introduces nUM after the last vowel, will still be applicable at the following  step. But if we apply 7.1.70 at this step, then a will no longer be the penultimate sound and so  6.4.14 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking,  and is classified as Type 2a (DOI conflict).  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right-most rule 6.1.68 and get: bhavat. At this step,  thanks to 1.1.62 pratyayalope pratyayalakṣaṇam, two rules are applicable: 

bhav a t 

 6.4.14 7.1.70 

As seen above, there is a Type 2a (DOI conflict) relationship between them. By my  interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 7.1.70 wins and we get bhavant. Here, 6.4.14 is not  applicable. We apply 8.2.23 saṁyogāntasya lopaḥ which teaches LOPA deletion of the second  consonant of a pada-final conjunct. This gives us *bhavan which is not the correct answer.6 

To get the correct answer, we have to apply 6.4.14 first, and then apply 7.1.70: bhavat + sU 🡪 bhavat (6.1.68) 🡪 bhavāt (6.4.14) 🡪 bhavānt (7.1.70) 🡪 bhavān (8.2.23). 

The tradition too takes cognizance of this problem, because even the application of its own  conflict resolution tools gives the wrong form. 7.1.70 is both nitya (the rule which  unidirectionally blocks the other rule) and para (the rule which comes after the other rule in  the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī) with respect to 6.4.14. And yet 6.4.14 has to prevail for us  to get the correct answer. On 6.4.14 the Kāśikā says: atra kr̥te dīrghe numāgamaḥ kartavyaḥ.  yadi hi paratvān nityatvāc ca nuṁ syāt, dīrghasya nimittam atūpadhā vihanyeta ‘Here, the  

5 An operation conditioned by an affix applies even if the affix has been replaced with LOPA. 6 Note that we cannot replace the penultimate a of bhavan at this stage with ā by 6.4.14 because 6.4.14  treats 8.2.23 as asiddha and thus cannot see that t has been deleted by 8.2.23. So 6.4.14 still sees the  form as bhavant, to which it cannot apply.

87 

augment nUM should be inserted [only] after lengthening [the vowel]. If nUM wins, because  it is para and nitya, then the cause of lengthening [namely] the status of a as the penultimate  sound is finished.’ 

Returning to the topic at hand, this example too seems to invalidate my interpretation of 1.4.2. I have not found a fully satisfactory way to overcome this problem. Nonetheless, I present here,  which I think might explain why this happens. Let us write down the group of rules to which  6.4.14 belongs, along with those words (in box brackets) which are continued by anuvr̥tti. 

(Please go to the next page)

88 

08 sarvanāmasthāne cāsambuddhau [dīrghaḥ nopadhāyāḥ] 

09 [sarvanāmasthāne cāsambuddhau dīrghaḥ nopadhāyāḥ] (vā ṣapūrvasya nigame) 

10 [sarvanāmasthāne cāsambuddhau dīrghaḥ nopadhāyāḥ] x sāntamahataḥ saṁyogasya 11 [sarvanāmasthāne cāsambuddhau dīrghaḥ upadhāyāḥ] x aptr̥ntr̥csvasr̥naptr̥…7 x 12 śau x [dīrghaḥ upadhāyāḥ] x inhanpūṣāryamṇām x 13 sau [cāsambuddhau dīrghaḥ upadhāyāḥ x inhanpūṣāryamṇām] x ca  14 [sau cāsambuddhau dīrghaḥ upadhāyāḥ] x atvasantasya !!! ca adhātoḥ  

If a term A in rule number ‘n’ does not have an equivalent term B in rule number n+1, then A becomes anuvr̥tta from rule n to n+1, if it is relevant  in rule n+1.8 For example, inhanpūṣāryamṇām of 6.4.12 is the equivalent of aptr̥ntr̥csvasr̥naptr̥… of 6.4.11 so aptr̥ntr̥csvasr̥naptr̥… is not  continued by anuvr̥tti from 6.4.11 to 6.4.12. The phrase vā ṣapūrvasya nigame makes the concerned operation optional in a certain context and  does not get continued into the following rules9. 

Note that cāsambuddhau ‘and not in vocative singular10’ which is anuvr̥tta from 6.4.8 into 6.4.9, 6.4.10 and 6.4.11 does not become anuvr̥tta in  6.4.12 śau inhanpūṣāryamṇām because Śi is never seen in sambuddhi ‘vocative singular’ forms. So, it is irrelevant there and does not get continued  into 6.4.12. The next rule is 6.4.13 sau ca, and we know that sU is added to bases to derive both vocative and non-vocative forms. cāsambuddhau is relevant in 6.4.13, because it can play the role of restricting 6.4.13 to only non-vocative cases of sU, and thus, gets anuvr̥tta in 6.4.13. This is  one of many examples in the Aṣṭādhyāyī in which a term displays what is called maṇḍukapluti ‘frog jump’, i.e., it becomes anuvr̥tta from rule  number ‘n’ to rule number ‘n+2’ without becoming anuvr̥tta in rule number ‘n+1’, thereby jumping like a frog from one rule in which it is relevant to the next rule in which it is relevant, skipping, on its way, those rules in which it would be irrelevant. 

7 aptr̥ntr̥csvasr̥naptr̥neṣṭr̥kṣattr̥hotr̥potr̥praśāstr̥̄ṇām. 

8 Joshi-Bhate 1984: 48. 

9 For more on the anuvr̥tti of optional terms see Joshi-Bhate (1984: 70). 

10 2.3.49 ekavacanaṁ sambuddhiḥ.

89 

Now let us look at saṁyogasya of 6.4.10. 

6.4.10 sāntamahataḥ saṁyogasya: a substitute long vowel replaces the short vowel that is  penultimate with respect to a n which is part of a stem-final conjunct either ending in s or  constituting part of the pre-affixal stem mahat- ‘great’ when a sarvanāmasthāna affix other  than sambuddhi follows. 

saṁyogasya is not relevant in 6.4.11, 6.4.12 and 6.4.13 because those bases do not end in a  saṁyoga ‘conjunct’. In the table above I have put ‘x’ marks under saṁyogasya to indicate this.  What about 6.4.14? The tradition does not continue saṁyogasya into 6.4.14. However, I think  that saṁyogasya is relevant in 6.4.14, so I propose to read saṁyogasya by anuvr̥tti in 6.4.14  (See ‘!!!’ sign). Like cāsambuddhau, saṁyogasya too displays the trait of maṇḍukapluti.  

Now 6.4.14 reads:  

6.4.14 atvasantasya cādhātoḥ (saṁyogasya sau cāsambuddhau dīrghaḥ upadhāyāḥ): a  substitute long vowel replaces a short vowel that is penultimate with respect to the stem-final  conjunct of a non-verbal stem ending in atU or with respect to the last sound of a non-verbal  stem ending in as, when a non-sambuddhi ending sU follows. 

Note that saṁyogasya is only relevant to atU and not to as. Now, let us perform the derivation  again, bearing this new meaning of 6.4.14 in mind: 

bhav a t + sU  

  

 7.1.70 6.1.68 

Note that 6.4.14, as interpreted by me, is not applicable here because bhavat does not end in a  conjunct. 7.1.70 and 6.1.68 do not block each other. This is a Type 2b (DOI non-conflict)  interaction.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.1.68 and get bhavat. Now by 1.1.62  pratyayalope pratyayalakṣaṇam, 7.1.70 applies and we get bhavant. Since bhavant ends in a  saṁyoga ‘conjunct’, my interpretation of 6.4.14 applies here: bhavānt. Finally, we apply 8.2.23  saṁyogāntasya lopaḥ and get the correct form: bhavān.  

Admittedly, this is a weak explanation because, in order to facilitate the anuvr̥tti of saṁyogasya in 1.4.14, I had to split the compound atvasantasya into two, the at part, which is compatible  with saṁyogasya, and the vas part, which is not. Despite the helpful work done by Joshi and 

90Bhate (1983, 1984) on the subject of anuvr̥tti, this is still a hitherto poorly understood topic.  As of now, we do not have sufficient evidence suggesting that it is acceptable to split a samāsa in this manner to accommodate items continued by anuvr̥tti. Further research needs to be done  on this topic. 

### 3.2 DOI in the Inflection of Taddhita, Samāsa and Kr̥danta Nominal Bases 

So far, we have looked at cases of DOI in the inflection of simple (i.e., underived) nominal  bases (cf. 1.2.45 arthavad adhātur apratyayaḥ prātipadikam). Now let us look at some cases  of DOI in the inflection of complex (i.e., derived) nominal bases such as kr̥t ‘primary  derivative’, taddhita ‘secondary derivative’, and samāsa ‘compound’ (cf. 1.2.46  kr̥ttaddhitasamāsāś ca). 

Generally speaking, as compared to the inflection of simple nominal bases, which we have  seen in the previous chapter and in this chapter, and verbal inflection and primary derivatives,  which we will see in the following chapters, we find a smaller number of examples of conflict in taddhita derivations, and even fewer examples in samāsa derivations. I will explain why this  is the case towards the end of chapter 4.  

We will see that the tradition manages to avoid dealing with conflict in the first four examples.  However, it has to rely on certain external (post-Pāṇinian) metarules to correctly derive these four forms. I will show that my solution for DOI (my interpretation of 1.4.2) can help us  perform these derivations without relying on such external metarules. In the following four examples, we do find cases of conflict. Here too, I use my solution for DOI (cf. my  interpretation of 1.4.2) to get the correct answer and also mention the traditional solution where  it is known. 

(1) Consider the genitive singular form of prati-ac11 ‘turned towards, facing’: pratīcas. By  2.2.18 kugatiprādayaḥ, prati-ac is a tatpuruṣa compound made of prati, which takes the  technical designation gati by 1.4.60 gatiś ca and ac, which is derived as follows: añcU + KvIN 

11 I use the ‘+’ sign between a base and an affix. Since ac is not an affix with respect to prati, I put a ‘– ’ instead of a ‘+’ between prati and ac.

(3.2.59 r̥tvigdadhr̥ksragdiguṣṇigañcuyujikruñcāṁ ca12) 🡪 ac + v (6.4.24 aniditāṁ hala  upadhāyāḥ kṅiti13) 🡪 ac (6.1.67 ver apr̥ktasya14).  

The Siddhāntakaumudī (SK) completes all the operations within the base before adding the  genitive singular affix Ṅas15: prati-ac (2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ) 🡪 pratyac (6.1.77  iko yaṇ aci). If the derivation is stopped at the addition of the genitive affix Ṅas to pratyac, that  does not give the correct answer: pratyac + Ṅas 🡪 *pratyacaḥ. 

The tradition has found a way to work around this. In pratyac + Ṅas, pratyac takes the  designation bha by 1.4.18 because it is followed by a non-sarvanāmasthāna affix beginning  with a vowel. Then, 6.4.138 acaḥ teaches that the a of verbal base ac (from añc), when  designated as bha, is replaced with LOPA: pratyc + Ṅas. To get the correct form, it takes  recourse to the metarule nimittābhāve naimittikasyāpy abhāvaḥ16, which teaches that when the  cause of an operation is lost, the impact or effect of that operation too is lost. In other words, if  X causes A to change to B, upon the deletion of X, B becomes A again. Thanks to this  paribhāṣā, since the cause of the operation 6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci, namely a, has been deleted, the  preceding y will go back to its original form i. Thus, we get pratic + Ṅas. At this step the  tradition applies 6.3.138 cau, which teaches that, the final aṆ of the preceding pada in a  compound is replaced with its dīrgha equivalent when c (from añc) follows. This gives the  correct form: pratīcaḥ.  

Another Pāṇinian paribhāṣā, which makes this very argument in terms of antaraṅga and  bahiraṅga operations, is cited by the Siddhāntakaumudī17 when discussing this derivation:  akr̥tavyūhāḥ pāṇinīyāḥ ‘The Pāṇinīyas do not insist that a rule should take effect if its causes  disappear’. Nāgeśa (Pbh 56, Paribhāṣenduśekhara), while discussing this paribhāṣā in  antaraṅga and bahiraṅga terms, says: bahiraṅgeṇāntaraṅgasya nimittavināśe paścāt  

12 Among other things, this rule teaches that KvIN occurs after the root añcU ‘to bend’ when this root  co-occurs with a pada ending in sUP. 

13 LOPA replaces the penultimate n of a verbal base ending in a consonant and not marked with I [in  the Dhātupāṭha] when an affix marked with K or Ṅ follows. 

14 Affix vI unaccompanied [by any other sound] is replaced with LOPA. 

15 We know this because of a paribhāṣā it mentions, will I will discuss below.  16 Another version of this, which we occasionally find in paribhāṣā texts, is nimittāpāye naimittikasyāpy  apāyaḥ. 

17 SK 417 (6.3.138 cau).

92 

sambhāvite antaraṅgaṁ neti yāvat ‘An antaraṅga operation (here, 6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci) should  not be undertaken if its cause would disappear later due to the bahiraṅga operation (here,  6.4.138 acaḥ)’. 

These two paribhāṣās require one to go a step back into the derivation and undo a previous  operation. This runs contrary to the idea that derivations should move in one direction, and that  each operation should take us one step forward (rather than backward) into the derivation.  Besides, if Pāṇini wanted us to use these metarules, he would have taught them explicitly in  the Aṣṭādhyāyī. For these reasons, I do not accept these two paribhāṣās. Now I will derive this  form using my method. Two rules are simultaneously applicable to prati - ac: 

 prati - ac 

 6.1.77 4.1.2 

4.1.2 svaujasamauṭchaṣṭābhyāmbhisṅebhyāmbhyasṅasibhyāmbhyasṅasosāmṅyossup18 6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci: iK (i, u, r̥, l̥) is replaced with yaṆ (y, v, r, l) when aC (vowel) follows. 

This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 4.1.2 and get prati  - ac + Ṅas. Here two rules are applicable: 

 prati - ac + Ṅas 

 6.1.77 6.4.138  

6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci: same as above. 

6.4.138 acaḥ: the a of ac which has taken the technical designation bha is replaced with LOPA. 

This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 6.4.138 wins, and we get:  praticaḥ 🡪 pratīcaḥ (6.3.138 cau), which is the correct form. 

18 This rule teaches all the declensional affixes. The affix that is applicable here is the genitive singular  Ṅas.

93 

(2) Let us derive the genitive singular of the perfect participle of sad ‘to sit’, namely sad + vas ‘one who had sat’. The Siddhāntakaumudī attaches the declensional affix Ṅas to the base only  after the base is fully ready.19 The base is derived by replacing LIṬ with KvasU: sad + LIṬ 🡪 sad + KvasU (3.2.108 bhāṣāyāṁ sadavasaśruvaḥ20). Now, (i) by 6.1.8 liṭi dhātor  anabhyāsasya, (which teaches that the un-reduplicated root undergoes reduplication when  followed by LIṬ), (ii) by 6.1.1 ekāco dve prathamasya (which teaches that the first syllable of  the root undergoes reduplication) and (iii) by 1.1.56 sthānivad ādeśo’nalvidhau (which teaches  that the substitute should be treated like the substituendum except when an operation relative  to the original sound is to be performed), we get sadsad + vas. By 7.4.60 halādiḥ śeṣaḥ, which  teaches that all but the first consonant of the abhyāsa (first half of sadsad) are deleted, we get  sasad + vas. Now, by 6.4.120 ata ekahalmadhye’nādeśāder liṭi21, we get sed + vas. At this  point, 7.2.67 vasv ekājādghasām is applicable, which, according to the tradition22, teaches that  the augment iṬ should be attached to vasU when it occurs after a root which, after doubling,  consists of a single syllable, or a root ending in ā, or ghas ‘to eat’. By applying this rule, we  get the base sedivas, but, if at the next step we add the genitive singular affix Ṅas, we get  *sedivasaḥ, which is the incorrect answer. 

Here, again, the tradition uses the two paribhāṣās discussed above to circumvent this problem.  In sedivas + Ṅas, sedivas takes the designation bha because it is followed by a non sarvanāmasthāna affix beginning with a vowel (cf. 1.4.18 yaci bham). To this, the tradition  applies 6.4.131 vasoḥ samprasāraṇam, which teaches that the semivowel of the affix vasU in  an item termed bha is replaced with the corresponding vowel u. This gives sediuas, and the  augment i in sedivas, which is attached to vas by 7.2.67 vasv ekājādghasām, is lost, because its  cause v no longer exists (cf. akr̥tavyūhāḥ pāṇinīyāḥ and nimittāpāye naimittikasyāpy apāyaḥ).  Then, the a of seduas is deleted by 6.1.108 samprasāraṇāc ca which teaches that both the  

19 We know this because of the use of the paribhāṣā, akr̥tavyūhāḥ pāṇinīyāḥ on SK 435 (6.4.131 vasoḥ samprasāraṇam). I will discuss this later in the example. 

20 The affix LIṬ is optionally replaced with KvasU in classical Sanskrit after the roots sadA ‘to sit’,  vasA ‘to inhabit’ and śru ‘to listen’ when the action has taken place in the past. 21 An a, which occurs in between two single consonants of a verbal base whose initial sound has not  undergone replacement, is replaced with e, when a LIṬ affix marked with K or Ṅ follows. In such cases,  the abhyāsa (i.e., the first of the two reduplicated syllables) is also deleted.  

22 I interpret this rule differently. I will discuss my interpretation later in this example. 

94 

samprasāraṇa replacement and the vowel following it are together replaced with the former.  This gives us sedus + Ṅas 🡪 seduṣaḥ, which is the correct form. 

Again, like in the previous example, I reject the use of these two anitya paribhāṣās. I perform  this derivation as follows. I add the affix LIṬ to sad by the following rule: 

3.2.115 parokṣe liṭ: affix LIṬ occurs after a verbal root when an unwitnessed (parokṣa) action  which is not current (anadyatana) is denoted in the past (bhūta). 

Then, the following rules become applicable: 

 sad + LIṬ  

 6.1.8 3.2.108  

6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya: an un-reduplicated root undergoes reduplication when followed  by LIṬ.23 

3.2.108 bhāṣāyāṁ sadavasaśruvaḥ: the affix LIṬ is optionally replaced with KvasU in classical  Sanskrit after the roots sadA ‘to sit’, vasA ‘to inhabit’ and śru ‘to listen’ when the action has  taken place in the past. 

This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 3.2.108 wins and we get sad  + vas. Multiple rules are applicable here: 

 sad + vas  

 6.1.8 7.2.67 4.1.2 

6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya: same as above. 

7.2.67 vasv ekājādghasām: (my interpretation) augment iṬ is introduced to vasU when it  occurs after a root which either consists of a single syllable, or ends in a, or else, is  constituted by ghas ‘to eat’.24 

23 Note that, the whole base does not undergo reduplication. Instead, only one syllable does. See 6.1.1  ekāco dve prathamasya and 6.1.2 ajāder dvitīyasya. 

24 The tradition interprets this rule as follows: augment iṬ is introduced to vasU when it occurs after a  root which, after doubling, either consists of a single syllable, or ends in a, or else, is constituted by  ghas ‘to eat’. Note that Pāṇini does not say ‘after doubling’ anywhere in his rule, and ‘after doubling’ 

95 

4.1.2 svaujasamauṭchaṣṭābhyāmbhisṅebhyāmbhyasṅasibhyāmbhyasṅasosāmṅyossup25 

This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the right-most rule 4.1.2 wins and we get sad + vas + Ṅas. Multiple rules are applicable here: 

 sad + vas + Ṅas 

 6.1.8 6.4.131 7.2.67 

6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya: same as above. 

7.2.67 vasv ekājādghasām: same as above. 

6.4.131 vasoḥ samprasāraṇam: vasU of an item termed bha undergoes samprasāraṇa.26 There is an SOI between 6.4.131 and 7.2.67. Let us find out which rule is more specific. 6.4.131: 

monosyllabic root / ākārānta root / ghas + vas (termed bha)  

other bases + vas (termed bha) 

7.2.67  

monosyllabic root / ākārānta root / ghas + vas 

The conditions highlighted in bold are relevant to this SOI. Since 6.4.131 has been taught  specifically for a bha-saṁjñaka vas, it is more specific and thus wins.  

Now let us consider the DOI relationship between 6.1.8 and 6.4.131. By my interpretation of  1.4.2, the RHS rule 6.4.131 wins and we get: sad + uas + Ṅas. Here, again, two rules are  applicable: 

cannot be inferred by anuvr̥tti either. The tradition takes the liberty to read this phrase into this rule  purely on the basis of certain derivational considerations. I do not think we should make such  assumptions and therefore I do not include ‘after doubling’ in my interpretation. 25 1.2.46 kr̥ttaddhitasamāsāś ca. 

26 1.4.18 yaci bham.

96 

sad + uas + Ṅas 

 6.1.8 6.1.108 

6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya: same as above. 

6.1.108 samprasāraṇāc ca: both the samprasāraṇa replacement and the vowel following it are  together replaced with the former.  

This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 6.1.108 wins and we get sad  + us + Ṅas. Thereafter, the derivation proceeds as follows: sadsad + us + Ṅas (6.1.8 liṭi dhātor  anabhyāsasya) 🡪 seduṣaḥ (6.4.120 ata ekahalmadhye’nādeśāder liṭi), which is the correct  form. 

(3) Let us derive the nominative plural of ‘descendant of garga’, first through the traditional  method and then through mine.  

The tradition27 adds the declensional affix only after the base is ready. As per the traditional  method, we first add the affix yaÑ to garga + Ṅas by 4.1.105 gargādibhyo yañ28; then by 2.4.71  supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ29, Ṅas is deleted, which gives us garga + yaÑ. At this juncture,  7.2.117 taddhiteṣv acām ādeḥ prescribes the vr̥ddhi substitution of the first vowel of garga  given that the following affix is marked with Ñ. Thus, we get gārga + yaÑ. The a of gārga is  deleted by 6.4.148 yasyeti ca, which teaches that the final i or a of a bha item is deleted when  it is followed by ī or a taddhita affix. Thus, we get our base gārgya. 

At this point, the tradition prescribes the addition of the affix Jas to the base gārgya: gārgya +  Jas. This leads to the application of 2.4.64 yañañōś ca, which teaches that the gotra affixes  yaÑ and aÑ are replaced with LUK when the following declensional affix denotes plural, except  when the base is feminine. Stopping here gives us the incorrect form: *gārgaḥ.  

27 I give a reference later in the example. 

28 The taddhita affix yaÑ is added to the syntactically related genitive form of any base included in the  list starting with garga to construct a form which means gotra-descendant of that individual. 29 A suP undergoes LUK deletion when it occurs inside a dhātu ‘verbal base’ or a prātipadika ‘nominal  base’.

97 

On 2.4.64, the Bhaimī commentary on the Laghusiddhāntakaumudī suggests the metarule, nimittāpāye naimittikasyāpy apāyaḥ, which we have discussed in the previous two examples,  to solve this problem: because yaÑ is deleted, the vr̥ddhi of the first vowel (cf. 7.2.117) and the  deletion of the final a (6.4.148), which were caused by yaÑ, also must be undone, thereby  giving us the correct form: garga + Jas 🡪 gargāḥ. However, I do not accept this metarule, as  stated above. I perform this derivation as follows. Upon adding the affix yaÑ to garga, the  following rules are applicable: 

 g a rg a + yaÑ  

 7.2.117 6.4.148 4.1.2 

7.2.117 taddhiteṣv acām ādeḥ: the first vowel of the base undergoes vr̥ddhi when an affix  marked with Ñ or Ṇ follows in taddhita derivations. 

6.4.148 yasyeti ca: the final i or a of a bha item is deleted when it is followed by ī or a taddhita affix. 

4.1.2 svaujasamauṭchaṣṭābhyāmbhisṅebhyāmbhyasṅasibhyāmbhyasṅasosāmṅyossup 

This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the right-most rule 4.1.2 applies and we  get gargya + yaÑ + Jas. Here multiple rules are applicable: 

 [ g a rg a + yaÑ ] + Jas 

 7.2.117 6.4.148 2.4.64 

7.2.117 taddhiteṣv acām ādeḥ: same as above. 

6.4.148 yasyeti ca: same as above. 

2.4.64 yañañoś ca: LUK replaces the gotra affixes yaÑ and aÑ introduced after a nominal stem  when that nominal stem ending in these affixes itself denotes plurality and is not followed by  a feminine affix.  

This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right most rule 2.4.64 and  get: garga + Jas 🡪 gargāḥ (6.1.102 prathamayoḥ pūrvasavarṇaḥ30), which is the correct form.  

30 The a, i or u at the end of the base and the following vowel, which constitutes the first sound of  nominative and accusative affixes, are together replaced with the long equivalent of the former.

98 

Note that, at this point, 7.2.117 and 6.4.148 no longer have a chance to apply. So, unlike the  traditional solution, mine does not require us to go backwards to undo the application of rules  like 7.2.117 and 6.4.148. Therefore, my solution is more acceptable than the one provided by  the tradition.  

(4) Now let us derive the nominative plural of ‘a kṣatriya descendent of the country of the  pañcālas’ first through the traditional method, and then through mine. The tradition first  derives the base and then adds the declensional affix at the end. Consider the following rule: 

4.1.168 janapadaśabdāt kṣatriyād añ: the taddhita affix aÑ is added to a syntactically related  base ending in the genitive which stands for both a janapada and its class of kṣatriyas, in order  to denote the sense of apatya ‘descendent’. 

The tradition31 starts by adding the affix aÑ to pañcāla + ām by 4.1.168: [pañcāla + ām] +  aÑ. ām is deleted by 2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ. At this juncture, 7.2.117 taddhiteṣv  acām ādeḥ teaches that the first vowel of pañcāla undergoes vr̥ddhi given that the following  affix is marked with Ñ. Upon applying this rule, we get: pāñcāla + aÑ. The a of pāñcāla is  deleted by 6.4.148 which teaches that the final i or a of a bha item is deleted when it is followed  by ī or a taddhita affix. Thus, we get our base pāñcāla. 

At this point, the tradition prescribes the addition of the affix Jas to the base pāñcāla: pāñcāla  + Jas. By 4.1.174 te tadrājāḥ, the taddhita affixes, including aÑ, which occur after a  syntactically related genitive to indicate a ‘kṣatriya descendent of the kṣatriyas of a janapada’  take the technical designation tadrāja. Thus 2.4.62 tadrājasya bahuṣu tenaivāstriyām becomes  applicable here: it teaches that LUK replaces a tadrāja affix introduced after a nominal stem  when it denotes plurality if that plurality is expressed by the stem ending in that affix except  when followed by a feminine affix. 

If the derivation stops here, we get pāñcāl + Jas 🡪 *pāñcālaḥ, which is not the correct answer.  On 2.4.62, the Bhaimī commentary on the Laghusiddhāntakaumudī suggests the metarule nimittāpāye naimittikasyāpy apāyaḥ, which we have discussed above, to solve this problem:  because aÑ is deleted, the vr̥ddhi of the first vowel (cf. 7.2.117) and the deletion of the final a  (6.4.148), which were caused by aÑ, also must be undone, thereby giving us the correct form:  

31 I give a reference later in the example.

99 

pañcāla + Jas 🡪 pañcālāḥ. However, I do not accept this metarule, as stated above. I perform  this derivation as follows. 

 [ p a ñcāl a + aÑ ]  

 7.2.117 6.4.148 4.1.2 

7.2.117 taddhiteṣv acām ādeḥ: same as above. 

6.4.148 yasyeti ca: same as above. 

4.1.2 svaujasamauṭchaṣṭābhyāmbhisṅebhyāmbhyasṅasibhyāmbhyasṅasosāmṅyossup 

This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the right-most rule 4.1.2 applies and we  get pañcāla + aÑ + Jas. Here multiple rules are applicable: 

[ p a ñcāl a + aÑ ] + Jas 

 7.2.117 6.4.148 2.4.62 

7.2.117 taddhiteṣv acām ādeḥ: same as above. 

6.4.148 yasyeti ca: same as above. 

2.4.62 tadrājasya bahuṣu tenaivāstriyām: same as above. 

This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the right-most rule 2.4.62 wins and we  get: pañcāla + Jas 🡪 pañcālāḥ (6.1.102 prathamayoḥ pūrvasavarṇaḥ) which is the correct  form. As in the previous example, at this point 7.2.117 and 6.4.148 can no longer apply. This  shows that my solution is better than the traditional one.  

(5) Now let us derive the nominative plural of ‘the student of gārgya’, or in other words, the  student of the descendent of garga’. To derive this form, cha is added to [gārgya + Ṅas] by  the following rule:  

4.2.114 vr̥ddhāt chaḥ: affix cha is added to a syntactically related item termed vr̥ddha (cf.  1.1.73 vr̥ddhir yasyācām ādis tad vr̥ddham) in the remaining senses.

100In gārgya + Ṅas + cha, Ṅas is deleted by 2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ and we get gārgya  + cha.32 Let us look at my solution first. I will only highlight the cases of conflict here. The  following rules are applicable: 

 [ gārgya + cha ]  

  

 7.1.2 4.1.2  

7.1.2 āyaneyīnīyiyaḥ phaḍhakhacchaghāṁ pratyayādīnām: the sounds ph, ḍh, kh, ch and gh,  when occurring at the beginning of the affix, are replaced with āyan, ey, īn, īy and iy respectively.  

4.1.2 svaujasamauṭchaṣṭābhyāmbhisṅebhyāmbhyasṅasibhyāmbhyasṅasosāmṅyossup The two rules do not block each other.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 4.1.2 and get: gārgya + cha + Jas. Here,  multiple rules are applicable: 

[ gārgya + cha ] + Jas 

  

 2.4.64 7.1.2 

7.1.2 āyaneyīnīyiyaḥ phaḍhakhacchaghāṁ pratyayādīnām: same as above. 

2.4.64 yañañoś ca: LUK replaces the gotra affixes yaÑ and aÑ introduced after a nominal stem  when that nominal stem ending in these affixes itself denotes plurality and is not followed by  a feminine affix.  

If we apply 2.4.64 at this step, 7.1.2 will be applicable at the following step. If we apply 7.1.2  at this step, thereby replacing ch of cha with īy (which gives us gārgya + īya), then 4.1.89  gotre’lug aci comes into play: 

32 Note that, in all the derivations that I have performed using my method in this chapter, I apply 2.4.71  supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ before actually starting the derivation. I do this to avoid making the  derivations unnecessarily lengthy and to avoid monotony. I take this liberty because the correctness of  the form we get at the end of the derivation does not depend on the step at which we apply 2.4.71.  Ideally, one should apply this rule only when it ought to be applied. 

101 

4.1.89 gotre’lug aci: LUK does not replace a taddhita affix denoting a gotra descendant, when  the following affix begins with a vowel and is introduced in the prāgdīvyatīya section33. 

Therefore, 2.4.64, which teaches LUK, will not be applicable at the following step. 7.1.2 blocks  2.4.64. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of Type 2a (DOI conflict).  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 7.1.2 wins and we get gārgya + īya + Jas. Here by  applying 6.4.148 yasyeti ca, we get gārgy + īya + Jas. At this stage, 6.4.151 applies: 

6.4.151 āpatyasya ca taddhite’nāti: a y which occurs after a consonant and is part of a taddhita  affix signifying an apatya ‘off-spring’ which is in turn part of an item termed bha, is replaced  with LOPA, when a taddhita affix not beginning with a, follows. 

This gives us the correct form: gārgīyāḥ. 

Even though Patañjali does discuss this derivation in his commentary on vt. 234 on 4.1.89  gotre’lug aci, he does not discuss this conflict.35 

(6) Let us now derive the nominative singular of puṣya ‘a moon (which is) in conjunction with  the constellation Puṣya’ of the sentence adya puṣyaḥ ‘today the moon is in conjunction with  constellation puṣya. We start by adding the affix aṆ to puṣya + Ṭā by 4.2.3: 

4.2.3 nakṣatreṇa yuktaḥ kālaḥ: the taddhita affix aṆ is introduced after a nominal form which  signifies a particular constellation (nakṣatra) and ends in tr̥tīyā ‘instrumental’, to denote the  time when the moon is in conjunction with that constellation. 

By 2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ, Ṭā is deleted, leading to puṣya + aṆ. Here, the following  rules are applicable: 

 [ p u ṣy a + aṆ ]  

 7.2.117 6.4.148 4.2.4 4.1.2 

33 4.1.83 prāg dīvyato’ṇ - 4.4.2 tena dīvyati khanati jayati jitam. 

34 Mbh II.240.14. 

35 He focuses on the question: should the ya of gārgya be deleted by 2.4.64 yañañoś ca before a plural  declensional affix is introduced to the derivation? I think this question is invalid because, in my view,  2.4.64 should only apply to a base when a plural affix is present. 

102 

7.2.117 taddhiteṣv acām ādeḥ: same as above. 

6.4.148 yasyeti ca: same as above. 

4.2.4 lub aviśeṣe: a taddhita affix introduced after a nominal stem ending in tr̥tīyā and denoting  a constellation is replaced with LUP when the time of conjunction is not qualified with specifications.36 

4.1.2 svaujasamauṭchaṣṭābhyāmbhisṅebhyāmbhyasṅasibhyāmbhyasṅasosāmṅyossup 

Let us look at the relationship of 4.2.4 with the two rules 6.4.148 and 7.2.117. If we apply 4.2.4  at this step, thereby deleting the affix which triggers rules 7.2.117 and 6.4.148, neither of these  two rules will be applicable at the following step. However, if we apply any of these two rules  at this step, 4.2.4 will still be applicable at the following step. So, 4.2.4 unidirectionally blocks  6.4.148 and 7.2.117 and is thus in conflict with both of them.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the right-most rule 4.1.2 applies and we get puṣya + aṆ + sU.  Here multiple rules are applicable: 

 [ p u ṣy a + aṆ ] + sU  

 7.2.117 6.4.148 4.2.4  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the right-most rule 4.2.4 applies and we get: puṣya + sU 🡪 puṣyaḥ, which is the correct form. 

The Bhaimī commentary on the Laghusiddhāntakaumudī does not mention this conflict. However, after applying 4.2.4 at this step, it does say that by 1.1.63 na lumatāṅgasya, 7.2.117  and 6.4.148 fail to apply at the following step.  

36 Note that our sentence is adya puṣyaḥ wherein the time mentioned is adya which is not specific  (unlike for example, rātri, which is specific); thus 4.2.4 is applicable here. 

103 

(7) Let us now derive the nominative singular form of ‘fifth’. We add ḌaṬ to pañcan + Ṅas  by the following rule: 

5.2.48 tasya pūraṇe ḍaṭ: the taddhita affix ḌaṬ occurs to denote the sense of pūraṇa ‘that by  which something is brought to completion, ordinal number’ after a syntactically related nominal stem which signifies number and ends in ṣaṣṭhī ‘genitive’. 

In pañcan + Ṅas + ḌaṬ, Ṅas is deleted by 2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ, so we get pañcan  + ḌaṬ. Thereafter, the following rules become applicable: 

 [ pañc an + ḌaṬ ]  

 6.4.143 5.2.49 4.1.2  6.4.143 ṭeḥ: the ṭi (cf. 1.1.64 aco’ntyādi ṭi) of an item termed bha is replaced with LOPA when  an affix marked with Ḍ follows. 

5.2.49 nāntād asaṁkhyāder maṭ: the augment mAṬ is attached to the taddhita affix ḌaṬ when  used to denote its ordinal, after a n-final nominal stem which ends in ṣaṣṭhī ‘genitive’ and does  not have a number as its initial constituent. 

4.1.2 svaujasamauṭchaṣṭābhyāmbhisṅebhyāmbhyasṅasibhyāmbhyasṅasosāmṅyossup 4.1.2 neither blocks nor is blocked by the other two rules.  

Now let us look at the relationship between 5.2.49 and 6.4.143. If we apply 5.2.49 at this step,  then ḌaṬ will take the augment mAṬ. As a result, it will begin with a consonant. This implies  that pañcan is no longer followed by an affix beginning with a vowel or y, and therefore it  cannot be called bha. Thus, 6.4.143, which applies only to items termed bha, will not be  applicable to an at the following step.  

If we apply 6.4.143 at this step, an gets deleted, so ḌaṬ will no longer be preceded by an item  ending in n. Therefore, 5.2.49 will not be applicable at the following step.  

Both rules block each other. This is a case of mutual blocking, and of Type 2a (DOI conflict).  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right-most rule 4.1.2 and get pañcan + ḌaṬ + sU.  Here two rules are applicable:

104 

 [ pañc an + ḌaṬ ] + sU  

 6.4.143 5.2.49  

6.4.143 ṭeḥ: same as above. 

5.2.49 nāntād asaṁkhyāder maṭ: same as above. 

This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 5.2.49 and get:  pañcan + ma + sU. By 1.4.17 svādiṣv asarvanāmasthāne37, pañcan takes the technical  designation pada, and so by 8.2.7 nalopaḥ prātipadikāntasya, the n of pañcan gets deleted.  Thus, we get the correct form: pañcamaḥ. 

On 5.2.49, Nyāsa says that 5.2.49 is antaraṅga with respect to 6.4.143 and thus wins.  

(8) Let us now look at the derivation of kālimmanyā ‘a woman who considers herself to be  Kālī’. This is the feminine version of the upapada compound made of the two padas kālī and  manya. manya is derived by adding KHaŚ to the verbal root man ‘to consider’ by the following  rule:  

3.2.83 ātmamāne khaś ca: affixes KHaŚ and ṆinI are added to the verbal root man when the  root co-occurs with a pada which ends in a sUP and the derivate denotes ātmamāna ‘thinking  about one’s own self’.  

Now, because KHaŚ is marked with Ś, it is a sārvadhātuka affix by 3.4.113 tiṅśit  sārvadhātukam. Here, 3.1.69 divādibhyaḥ ŚyaN instructs us to add the affix ŚyaN between the  root man, which belongs to the fourth class of verbal roots, and KHaŚ, which is a sārvadhātuka affix used in the active sense. This gives us manya + a. By 6.1.97 ato guṇe, both a and the  guṇa sound following it are replaced with the latter. This gives us manya.  

37 A form is termed pada when a svādi (affixes enumerated under 4.1.2 svaujas... through 5.4.151 uraḥ prabhr̥tibhyaḥ kap) affix which is not a sarvanāmasthāna (sU, au, Jas, am, auṬ; see 4.1.2 svaujas...)  follows.

105 

Now let us build the compound: [kālī Ṅas manya]38. By 2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ, Ṅas  is deleted. Here two rules are simultaneously applicable: 

 kāl ī - manya 

 6.3.66 6.3.67 

6.3.66 khity anavyayasya: the final vowel of the first member of a compound, except  indeclinables, is replaced with a short vowel, when a constituent marked with KH combines to  follow. 

6.3.67 arurdviṣadajantasya mum: augment mUM is introduced to arus, dviṣat and word ending  in a vowel, except indeclinables, when a constituent marked with KH combines to follow. 

If we apply 6.3.66 at this step, 6.3.67 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply  6.3.67 at this step, ī will no longer be the final sound of the pūrvapada. Thus, 6.3.66 will not  be applicable at the following step.  

This is a case of unidirectional blocking and thus of Type 2a (DOI conflict).  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 6.3.67 wins, and we get: *kālīmmanya, which is  the wrong form. To get the correct form, we first need to apply 6.3.66, thereby shortening ī or  kālī, and only then introduce the augment mUM, which gives us the correct form: kālimmanya.  After this we add the feminine affix ṬāP by 4.1.4 ajādyataṣ ṭāp to get kālimmanyā.  

On this topic, the Kāśikā says: mumā hrasvo na bādhyate, anyathā hi hrasvaśāsanam  anarthakaṁ syāt ‘shortening is not blocked by the mUM. Otherwise, the instruction about  shortening would be futile’.  

Coming back to the problem, how do we explain this anomaly? Notice that these rules have  been taught one after another. Let us look at them along with words that have been continued  into them by anuvr̥tti. 

6.3.66 khity anavyayasya (uttarapade hrasvaḥ) 

6.3.67 (khity anavyayasya uttarapade) arurdviṣadajantasya mum 

38 One could argue that this should be [kālī am manya]. For a detailed discussion on this topic, see  Scharf (2016). 

106 

While the tradition continues khity, anavyayasya and uttarapade from 6.3.66 into 6.3.67 by  anuvr̥tti, it does not continue hrasvaḥ into 6.3.67 by anuvr̥tti. I think that Pāṇini intended for  hrasvaḥ too to be continued into 6.3.67 by anuvr̥tti. To facilitate its case agreement with  anavyayasya, hrasvaḥ should be read not in the nominative but instead in the genitive, as  hrasvasya, in 6.3.67. This gives us the following meaning of 6.3.67: ‘augment mUM is  introduced to arus, dviṣat and a word ending in a short vowel, except indeclinables, when a  constituent marked with KH combines to follow.’ 

Let us see how the derivation proceeds if we accept my interpretation of 6.3.67. At the step kālī - manya, only 6.3.66 is applicable. Upon its application, we get: kāli - manya. Now, 6.3.67  applies and we get kālimmanya. Upon adding the feminine affix ṬāP, we get the correct form:  kālimmanyā. 

### 3.3 SOI in Taddhita derivations 

The cases of SOI which we find in samāsa derivations are few and fairly simple. I will not be  discussing them in this thesis. In taddhita derivations, we come across examples of SOI between rules teaching affixation. Consider the derivation of autsa ‘male offspring of utsa’ (cf.  4.1.92 tasyāpatyam ‘his offspring’). Three rules teach the addition of three different affixes: 

4.1.83 prāg dīvyato’ṇ: the taddhita affix aṆ is added to denote senses taught in rules from here  up to 4.4.2 tena dīvyati khanati jayati jitam. 

4.1.86 utsādibhyo’ñ: the taddhita affix aÑ is added to denote senses taught in rules from here  up to 4.4.2 tena dīvyati khanati jayati jitam after forms of stem belonging to the list headed by  utsa. 

4.1.95 ata iñ: the taddhita affix iÑ is added to denote ‘his offspring’ after forms of nominal  stems ending in a. 

Now let us write down the conditions in which these rules apply. Remember that, as always,  we write the sounds outside brackets and their characteristics inside brackets.

107 

4.1.83  

-ending in a 

-ending in any other sound  

4.1.86  

-ending in a (utsādi class) 

-ending in any other sound (utsādi class) 

4.1.95 

-ending in a 

Upon comparing the conditions written in bold, we see that 4.1.86 is more specific that the  other two rules, on account of the condition ‘utsādi class’. We get the correct form: [utsa +  Ṅas] + aÑ 🡪 autsa ‘offspring of utsa’ (2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ, 7.2.117 taddhiteṣv acām ādeḥ, 6.4.148 yasyeti ca).  

On 4.1.86, the Kāśikā says aṇas tadapavādānāṁ ca bādhakaḥ, implying that this rule is an  exception of both 4.1.83 and exceptions of 4.1.83 such as 4.1.95. 

The other examples in the taddhita section are quite similar to this one, so we shall not look at  them.39 

This brings us to the end of this chapter, and also to the end of our study of examples of conflict  from sandhi, subanta, taddhita and samāsa derivations. In the following chapter, we shall look  at examples from tiṅanta and kr̥danta derivations.  

39 For a detailed study, see Deo (2007).

## 
Chapter Four 

### 4.1 Aṅgādhikāra 

Before I examine examples of rule interaction at the same step in tiṄ and kr̥t derivations, I will  examine rules 6.4.1 aṅgasya and 1.4.13 yasmāt pratyayavidhis tadādi pratyaye’ṅgam which  play a pivotal role in running Pāṇini’s grammatical machine. 

6.4.1 aṅgasya is an adhikāra (heading) sūtra, the jurisdiction of which continues all the way  up to the end of 7.4. Pāṇini defines the term aṅga in 1.4.13 yasmāt pratyayavidhis tadādi  pratyaye’ṅgam. Sharma translates this as follows: ‘a form beginning with that after which an  affix is introduced is termed aṅga when the affix follows’. 

I think that the tradition has not correctly understood these rules, as a result of which it faces  multiple problems in performing certain derivations. In this section, I will present my  interpretations of these rules, and show how my interpretations enable us to perform these  derivations correctly. 

In my opinion, only one item can be called an aṅga with respect to a certain pratyaya in a  derivation. I must admit that I am unable to support this statement using Pāṇini’s rules.  However, through the examples discussed in section 4.2 of this chapter, I will show that it is  not possible to correctly perform certain derivations without accepting this assumption. 

Let me discuss an example from verbal inflection to explain what I mean. Consider the  derivation of the present-tense third-person singular form of cit ‘to think’: cit + LAṬ (3.2.123 vartamāne laṭ1) 🡪 cit + tiP (3.4.77 lasya, 3.4.78 tiptasjhi…2). According to the tradition3, cit  is an aṅga with respect to tiP. Then, after we add the vikaraṇa ŚaP by 3.1.68 kartari śap4, we  get cit + ŚaP + tiP. According to the tradition, cit + ŚaP too is an aṅga with respect to tiP.  

1 Affix LAṬ occurs after a verbal root when the action is denoted at the current time (vartamāna). 2 Tip-tas-jhi-sip-thas-tha-mib-vas-mas-ta-ātāṁ-jha-thās-āthāṁ-dhvam-iḍ-vahi-mahiṅ. 3 Though the tradition does not explicitly state this, it becomes clear from the derivations we will  examine below that such is indeed the case.  

4 Affix ŚaP occurs after a verbal root when a sārvadhātuka affix which denotes kartr̥ ‘agent’ follows.

109 

Thereafter, we apply 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca5 to cit and get cet + ŚaP + tiP i.e., ceta  + tiP. According to the tradition, ceta too can be called an aṅga with respect to tiP. 

So, cit, cit + ŚaP and ceta can all be called aṅga with respect to tiP, in the tradition’s opinion.  I disagree with the traditional perspective: in my opinion, we can have only one aṅga per affix  per derivation6. So, which one of the three options, namely cit, cit + ŚaP and ceta, should be  called an aṅga with respect to tiP? I think ceta alone can be called an aṅga with respect to tiP. 

I will present my arguments to support this claim below. But before we proceed, I must admit  that I am unable to provide any strong evidence from Pāṇini’s rules to justify the arguments I  make below. Nonetheless, I will discuss some derivations in section 4.2 of this chapter which  will prove that if we accept any other item but ceta as the aṅga with respect to tiP, we risk  getting the wrong form at the end of the derivation. That said, now let us consider all three  possibilities, namely cit, cit + ŚaP and ceta.  

Let us first look at cit. If Pāṇini wanted us to treat cit as an aṅga with respect to tiP, he could  have simply said yasmāt pratyayavidhis tad pratyaye’ṅgam ‘a form after which an affix is  introduced is termed aṅga when the affix follows.’ Thus, I do not think that we should call cit  an aṅga with respect to tiP. This leaves us with two options: cit + ŚaP and ceta. Let us closely  consider 1.4.13 in the context of this derivation to decide which of the two should be called an  aṅga with respect to tiP.  

yasmāt – to (lit. after) cit 

pratyayavidhis – (upon the) addition of tiP 

tadādi – that which begins with cit 

pratyaye – when tiP follows 

aṅgam – (is called) aṅga. 

5 Guṇa replaces the iK of a verbal base which ends in the augment pUK or which has a laghu ‘light’  vowel as its penultimate sound when a sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows. 6 I must clarify that, in my view, the modified version of an aṅga too can be called an aṅga, thanks to  1.1.56 sthānivad ādeśo’nalvidhau, which teaches that the substitute is treated like the substituendum,  except when an operation relative to the original sound is to be performed. So, for example, in deva +  bhyām, deva is an aṅga with respect to bhyām. By applying 7.3.102 supi ca, we get devā + bhyām. devā too can be called an aṅga with respect to bhyām by 1.1.56 sthānivad ādeśo’nalvidhau.

110‘Upon the addition of tiP to cit, that which begins with cit is called aṅga when tiP follows.’ 

The form which begins with cit is an aṅga with respect to tiP. Can we say that cit + ŚaP begins with cit? I do not think so. I think cit + ŚaP is still just a string of two separate items, namely  the root cit and the vikaraṇa affix ŚaP. Only when they are fused into a single form that begins  with cit, that form can be called an aṅga with respect to tiP. When can we fuse cit and ŚaP into  a single form? I think we can do that after applying all possible rules to cit and ŚaP, except  those that are triggered by tiP.  

So here, we apply 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca to cit (an operation triggered by ŚaP, not  by tiP) and get cet + ŚaP + tiP. Note that cet and ŚaP cannot undergo any other operations which are not triggered by tiP, so we can fuse cet + ŚaP into a single form, i.e., ceta. Ceta begins with cet and is followed by tiP, so it can be called an aṅga with respect to tiP. I  summarize this information in this table: 

Step 

	Question 

	Traditional opinion 

	My opinion

	cit + tiP 

	Is cit an aṅga w.r.t.7 tiP? 

	Yes 

	No

	cit + ŚaP + tiP 

	Is cit + ŚaP an aṅga w.r.t. tiP? 

	Yes 

	No

	ceta + tiP 

	Is ceta an aṅga w.r.t. tiP? 

	Yes 

	Yes

	







In my opinion, through 6.4.1 aṅgasya, Pāṇini teaches that, for any P + Q, a rule RP taught in  the aṅgādhikāra which is triggered by Q is applicable to its intended operand P only if P is an  aṅga with respect to affix Q. Similarly, a rule RQ taught in the aṅgādhikāra which is triggered  by P is applicable to its intended operand Q only if P is an aṅga with respect to affix Q. 

Also, note that I agree with the tradition that cit is an aṅga with respect to ŚaP. So, at the step  cit + ŚaP + tiP, 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca, which belongs to the aṅgādhikāra and  which is triggered by ŚaP, is applicable to cit.  

Before we go further, note that, we find vikaraṇas only in tiṅanta and kr̥danta derivations. So,  in the rest of the derivations, it is very easy to determine what we should call an aṅga with  respect to the affix. For instance, in deva + bhis (example 1 of section 2.7, chapter 2), deva is  an aṅga with respect to bhis simply because the affix bhis has been added to deva. Similarly,  in sad + vas + Ṅas (example 2 of section 3.2, chapter 3), sad + vas is an aṅga with respect to  

7 w.r.t. = with respect to.

111 

Ṅas simply because the affix Ṅas has been added to sad + vas. In derivations involving  vikaraṇas, because we add affix C to base A and then add another affix B between base A and  affix C, the process of identifying the aṅga with respect to affix C becomes somewhat  complicated, as observed above.  

### 4.2 Examples of Application of 1.4.13 and 6.4.1 

Now I will discuss some examples through which I will show that my interpretation of 1.4.13  and 6.4.1 alone can help us derive the correct final form. But first, let me offer a clarification.  

In many of the examples discussed in this chapter, the derivation should begin with: verbal  base + lakāra. At this stage, there are two possibilities: 

(i) only one rule, i.e., the rule which teaches the replacement of the lakāra is applicable, and this rule applies. 

(ii) multiple rules, including the rule which teaches the replacement of the lakāra are  applicable.  

verbal base + lakāra 

 M N O 

The rule O, which teaches the replacement of the lakāra is the right-most. Thus, by my  interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply rule O. 

Note that, in both cases (i) and (ii), the rule that replaces the lakāra applies at the first step. So,  in order to simplify the presentation, in all the examples where the derivation should start with  verbal base + lakāra, I simply start it with verbal base + tiṄ (one of the eighteen finite  replacements of the lakāras) instead. For instance, in the first derivation discussed in this  section, technically the derivation should proceed as follows: edh + LAṬ (3.2.123 vartamāne  laṭ) 🡪 edh + jha (3.4.77 lasya, 3.4.78 tiptasjhi…). However, I start with edh + jha, purely for  the purpose of avoiding redundancy. 

112 

(1) edh + jha – ‘to grow’, present third-person plural8 

As stated in section 4.1 of this chapter, we cannot call edh an aṅga with respect to jha.  Consequently, at this step, rules taught in the aṅgādhikāra (6.4 – 7.4), such as 7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ (which teaches that a jh which is the initial sound an affix is replaced with ant) or 7.1.5  ātmanepadeṣv anataḥ (which teaches that a jh, which is the initial sound of an ātmanepada affix preceded by a verbal base that does not end in a, is replaced with at) cannot apply to jh. 

Here, only two rules are applicable:  

edh + jh a 

 3.1.68 3.4.79  

3.1.68 kartari śap: same as above. 

3.4.79 ṭita ātmanepadānāṁ ṭer e: the part that begins with the last vowel (ṭi)9 of an ātmanepada replacement of a lakāra marked with Ṭ is replaced with e. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.79 and get: edh + jhe. At this stage too, we cannot call edh an aṅga with respect to jhe. Thus, 7.1.3 and 7.1.5 are not applicable  here. Only one rule, namely 3.1.68 is applicable. Upon applying it, we get edh + ŚaP + jhe. At  this step, edh and ŚaP cannot undergo any further operations which are not triggered by jhe, so  we can simply write edh + ŚaP as edha. edha is an aṅga with respect to jhe. At this stage, of  the two aforementioned rules which belong to the aṅgādhikāra, 7.1.3 is applicable but 7.1.5 is  not. We apply 7.1.3, and get edha + ante. By 6.1.97 ato guṇe10, we get the correct form:  edhante. 

To the best of my knowledge, the tradition does not discuss this example. However, let us  consider what would have happened if we had not accepted my interpretations of 1.4.13 and  6.4.1 respectively. At the step edh + jha, four rules would become applicable:  

8 Unless I explicitly state that the form being derived is passive, it must be assumed that it is active. 9 1.1.64 aco’ntyādi ṭi.  

10 When a short a, that is not pada-final (word-final) is followed by a guṇa vowel i.e., a, e, or o, then  both a and the following guṇa are replaced with the latter.

113 

edh + jh a  

  

 3.1.68 7.1.3 7.1.5 3.4.79  Note that all the DOI relationships here are of Type 2b (DOI non-conflict). As stated before,  the tradition is not interested in non-conflict and mostly applies rules in a haphazard order in  such cases.  

There is an SOI between 7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ and 7.1.5 ātmanepadeṣv anataḥ. 7.1.5 is more specific  than and thus wins against 7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ. If the tradition applies 7.1.5, which replaces jh with  at first and applies 3.1.68 kartari śap at a later step, that gives *edhate, which is not the correct  form. 

My interpretations of 1.4.13 yasmāt pratyayavidhis tadādi pratyaye’ṅgam and 6.4.1 aṅgasya respectively ensure that jh replacement, which is taught in the aṅgādhikāra, takes place only  after the application of 3.1.68 kartari śap, which is taught outside the aṅgādhikāra. After the  application of 3.1.68, 7.1.5 ātmanepadeṣv anataḥ, which is an exception of 7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ, is  no longer applicable to jh, and thus 7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ applies to jh. This gives the correct form, edhante. 

(2) dhā + jhi – ‘to place’, present third-person plural 

As stated before, dhā cannot be called an aṅga with respect to jhi. Consequently, rules taught  in the aṅgādhikāra (6.4 – 7.4) cannot apply to dhā or jhi. For example, 7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ cannot  apply here. The derivation proceeds as follows: dhā + ŚaP + jhi (3.1.68 kartari śap) 🡪 dhā +  ŚLU + jhi (2.4.75 juhotyādibhyaḥ śluḥ11) 🡪 dhādhā + ŚLU + jhi (6.1.10 ślau12) 🡪 dhadhā +  ŚLU + jhi (7.4.59 hrasvaḥ13). At this point, we notice that dhadhā and ŚLU cannot undergo  any other operations which are not triggered by jhi. So, we can write dhadhā + ŚLU as dhadhā. 

11 When the affix ŚaP is preceded by any verbal root belonging to the list headed by hu ‘to perform  sacrifice’, it is replaced with ŚLU (cf. 1.1.61 pratyayasya lukślulupaḥ). 

12 A verbal base which has not already undergone reduplication undergoes reduplication when it is  followed by ŚLU. (Note that, the whole base does not undergo reduplication. Instead, only one syllable  does. See 6.1.1 ekāco dve prathamasya and 6.1.2 ajāder dvitīyasya. Unless necessary, I will not repeat  this clarification in this chapter). 

13 The vowel of the abhyāsa ‘first of two reduplicated syllables’ is replaced with its short counterpart. 

114 

In dhadhā + jhi, dhadhā can be called an aṅga with respect to jhi. Therefore, the following  rules from the aṅgādhikāra are applicable here: 

 dh a dh ā + jh i 

 6.4.112 7.1.3 7.1.4 6.4.112 śnābhyastayor ātaḥ: the ā of the affix Śnā or the ā at the end of a reduplicated verbal  base is replaced with LOPA when a sārvadhātuka affix marked with K or Ṅ follows. 

7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ: a jh which is the initial sound an affix is replaced with ant. 

7.1.4 ad abhyastāt: when preceded by a reduplicated base, a jh which is the initial sound an  affix is replaced with at. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we perform the RHS operation. But there is an SOI between  7.1.3 and 7.1.4, both of which apply to the RHS operand. Because 7.1.4 has been taught for jh  when it is preceded by a reduplicated base, it is more specific and wins. Thus, we get: dhadhā  + ati. Here 6.4.112 śnābhyastayor ātaḥ applies and we get dhadh + ati. Now that all the  possible rules from the sapādasaptādhyāyī have applied, a rule from the tripādī section  applies14:  

8.4.54 abhyāse car ca: in an abhyāsa (first of two reduplicated syllables), jhaL (a non-nasal  stop or a fricative) is replaced with caR (c, ṭ, t, k, p, ś, ṣ, s) or jaŚ (j, b, g, ḍ, d). 

Thus, we get dhadhati 🡪 dadhati, which is the correct answer. 

Let us now look at how the tradition tackles this problem. Like in the previous example, in this  example too, there are no cases of DOI conflict, and so the tradition chooses to apply rules in  a random order. But some sequences of rule application can give the wrong answer. For  example: dhā + jhi 🡪 dhā + ŚaP + jhi (3.1.68) 🡪 dhā + ŚaP + anti (7.1.3) 🡪 dhā + ŚLU +  anti (2.4.75) 🡪 *dadhanti (6.1.10 ślau etc.). In sum, if jh undergoes replacement before the  reduplication of dhā, we get the wrong answer. To address this issue, the tradition has come up  

14 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham teaches that from this rule onwards, a following rule is asiddha ‘suspended’ with respect to a preceding rule. So, if 8.4.54 and any rule that precedes it in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial  order are simultaneously applicable, then the latter will not acknowledge 8.4.54 and will thus apply at  that step. 8.4.54 can apply only after this. I will demonstrate this more elaborately in the following  chapter which is devoted to the concepts asiddha and asiddhavat.

with the following ideas. Consider paribhāṣās 62 and 63 of the Paribhāṣenduśekhara and their  translation by Kielhorn: 

pūrvaṁ hy apavādā abhiniviśante paścād utsargāḥ (62). 

‘apavādas, it is certain, are considered first (in order to find out where they apply); afterwards  the general rules (are made to take effect in all cases to which it has thus been ascertained that  the apavādas do not apply)’.  

prakalpya vāpavādaviṣayaṁ tata utsargo’bhiniviśate (63).15 

‘Or (we may say that) first all (forms) which fall under the apavāda are set aside, and that  subsequently the general rule is employed (in the formation of the remaining forms).” 

Let us see what happens if we follow these paribhāṣās at the first step (dhā + jhi). At this step,  7.1.4 ad abhyastāt, which is the apavāda of 7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ, is not applicable. Since the apavāda is not applicable, we go ahead and apply the utsarga 7.1.3. But this gives us the wrong form  *dadhanti. Taking cognizance of this problem, the tradition has come up with the following  metarule: 

upasaṁjaniṣyamāṇanimitto’py apavāda upasaṁjātanimittam apy utsargaṁ bādhata iti (64). 

‘An apavāda supersedes, even though the causes of its (application) are still to present  themselves, a general rule the causes (of the application) of which are already present.’ 

In other words, this paribhāṣā teaches that even though 7.1.3 is applicable to jh from the  beginning of the derivation, one must not replace jh until the apavāda 7.1.4 becomes  applicable. This gives the correct answer, dadhati.  

As stated in the first chapter, the tradition often comes up with a new paribhāṣā to address  individual problems like this one. Paribhāṣā 64 is a good case in point.  

My method ensures that the replacement of jha, which is taught in the aṅgādhikāra, takes place  after the reduplication of dhā, which is taught outside the aṅgādhikāra. Therefore, 7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ does not become applicable until 7.1.4 ad abhyastāt, its exception, also becomes  applicable. 7.1.4 wins, thereby giving the correct form dadhati. My method is able to tackle  

15 Paribhāṣās 62 and 63 are found mentioned together on numerous occasions in the Mahābhāṣya (See  Bronkhorst 2004: 18, footnote 11 for details).

116 

this issue without relying on paribhāṣās like Pbh 64, which require us to look ahead into the  derivation. 

Before we move on to discussing other examples, note that Pāṇini teaches most substitutions and other operations pertaining to the eighteen finite affixes from 3.4.77 to 3.4.112. For  example, 3.4.87 ser hy apic ca16, 3.4.101 tasthasthamipāṁ tāṁtaṁtāmaḥ17 etc. He teaches the  substitution of jhi from 3.4.108 jher jus to 3.4.112 dviṣaś ca. However, the three rules teaching  the replacement of jh, i.e., 7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ, 7.1.4 ad abhyastāt, and 7.1.5 ātmanepadeṣv anataḥ are found in the aṅgādhikāra, and not in the section 3.4.77-3.4.112. This strongly suggests that  Pāṇini wants us to treat 7.1.3-7.1.5 differently, that is, he wants us to apply them only when jh is part of an affix which is preceded by what I define as an aṅga.  

(3) hā + tas – ‘to abandon’, present third-person dual 

hā is not an aṅga with respect to tas. So here, we cannot apply rules from the aṅgādhikāra,  such as 6.4.116 jahāteś ca (see translation below). The derivation proceeds as follows: hā +  tas 🡪 hā + ŚaP + tas (3.1.68 kartari śap) 🡪 hā + ŚLU + tas (2.4.75 juhotyādibhyaḥ śluḥ) 🡪 hāhā + ŚLU + tas (6.1.10 ślau). Here, two rules are applicable, which are from the  aṅgādhikāra, but which are not triggered by tas:  

 h ā hā + ŚLU + tas 

 7.4.62 7.4.59  

7.4.62 kuhoś cuḥ: a consonant of the k-series (kU), or a h, that is part of the abhyāsa (first of  two reduplicated syllables) is replaced with a consonant of the c-series (cU). 

7.4.59 hrasvaḥ: the vowel of the abhyāsa (first of two reduplicated syllables) is replaced with its short counterpart. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.4.59 and get hahā + ŚLU + tas. To  this, we apply 7.4.62 and get jhahā + ŚLU + tas. Now, jhahā and ŚLU cannot undergo any  further operations which are not triggered by tas, so we can write jhahā + ŚLU as jhahā. Now,  

16 A siP replacement of LOṬ is replaced with hi and is treated as if not marked with P. 17 The tas, thas, tha and miP replacements for any lakāra marked with Ṅ, are replaced with tām, tam,  ta and am, respectively.

117 

jhahā is an aṅga with respect to tas. Thus, the following rules from the aṅgādhikāra, which  are triggered by tas, become applicable: 

 jhah ā + tas 

 6.4.113 6.4.116 

6.4.113 ī haly aghoḥ: the final ā of a base which ends in Śnā, or of a reduplicated stem  (abhyasta) excluding those termed ghu, is replaced with ī when a sārvadhātuka affix beginning  with a consonant and marked with K or Ṅ follows.  

6.4.116 jahāteś ca: the final ā of hā 'to abandon’, is optionally replaced with i, when a sārvadhātuka affix beginning with a consonant and marked with K or Ṅ follows. 

There is an SOI relationship between 6.4.113 and 6.4.116. Since 6.4.116 has been taught  specifically for hā, it wins, as a result of which we get jhahitas. Finally, since all rules from the  sapādasaptādhyāyī have been applied, we apply 8.4.54 abhyāse car ca from the tripādī and  get jhahitaḥ 🡪 jahitaḥ, which is the correct answer.  

Note that 6.4.116 jahāteś ca is an optional rule. If we do not implement18 it, 6.4.113 ī haly aghoḥ applies, giving us jahītaḥ, which is also correct.  

To the best of my knowledge, the tradition has not discussed this problem. But, since this  derivation does not involve any DOI conflicts, the tradition would have applied rules in any  haphazard order. Let us look at one of the possible paths this derivation would have taken if  we had not accepted my interpretations of 1.4.13 and 6.4.1 respectively: hā + tas 🡪 hā + ŚaP + tas (3.1.68 kartari śap) 🡪 hā + ŚLU + tas (2.4.75 juhotyādibhyaḥ śluḥ) 🡪 hi + ŚLU + tas 

(6.4.116 jahāteś ca) 🡪 *jihitaḥ (6.1.10 ślau etc).  

The possibility of getting such a wrong answer is completely eliminated by following my  interpretations of 1.4.13 and 6.4.1 respectively. This is because, my method ensures that  6.4.116, which is taught in the aṅgādhikāra and replaces ā of hā with i, applies only after the reduplication of root hā by 6.1.10 ślau, which is taught outside the aṅgādhikāra. 

18 Note that I will use the word ‘implement’ henceforth in relation with optionality.

118 

(4) vap + ta – ‘to sow’, imperfect passive third-person singular  

Note that vap is not an aṅga with respect to ta, so rules like 6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ (see  translation below) which are part of the aṅgādhikāra, cannot apply at this step. The following  rules are applicable to vap + ta: 

v ap + ta 

 6.1.15 3.1.67 

6.1.15 vacisvapiyajādīnām ca: roots vac ‘to speak’, svap ‘to sleep’, and those headed by yaj ‘to perform sacrifice’ undergo samprasāraṇa when an affix marked with K follows.19 

3.1.67 sārvadhātuke yak: affix yaK occurs after a verbal root when a sārvadhātuka affix which  denotes bhāva or karman follows. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 3.1.67 applies, and we get: vap + yaK + ta.  Thereafter the derivation proceeds as follows: vap + yaK + ta 🡪 uap + yaK + ta (6.1.15) 🡪 up + yaK + ta (6.1.108 samprasāraṇāc ca20). Since up and yaK cannot undergo any other  operations which are not triggered by ta, we can write up + yaK as upya. In upya + ta, upya is  an aṅga with respect to ta. Thus, the following rules from the aṅgādhikāra which are triggered  by ta become applicable: 

upya + ta 

 6.4.71 6.4.72 

6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ: the udātta ‘high-pitched’ augment aṬ is attached to a verbal  base when affixes LUṄ, LAṄ and LR̥Ṅ follow. 

6.4.72 āḍ ajādīnām: the udāttaḥ ‘high-pitched’ augment āṬ is attached to a verbal base which  begins with a vowel (aC) when affixes LUṄ, LAṄ and LR̥Ṅ follow. 

19 Note that this rule is applicable because ta, by virtue of being an apit sārvadhātuka, can be treated as marked with K, by 1.2.4 sārvadhātukam apit.  

20 A samprasāraṇa vowel and the following vowel, are together replaced with the former.

119 

This is a case of SOI. 6.4.72 has been taught specifically for bases which begin with a vowel  and thus wins, thereby giving us the correct form ā-upya + ta 🡪 aupyata (6.1.90 āṭaś ca21).  

Let us now consider how the tradition deals with this example. Like in the previous examples,  here too, we do not find any instances of DOI conflict. Therefore, the tradition applies rules in  a random order. If the attachment of the augment had been undertaken before samprasāraṇa,  we would have got the incorrect form: a-vapyata (6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ) 🡪 a-uapyata 

(6.1.15 vacisvapiyajādīnām ca) 🡪 *opyata (6.1.108 samprasāraṇāc ca, 6.1.78  eco’yavāyāvaḥ). In order to overcome this problem, the Kāśikā, on 6.4.72 āḍ ajādīnām, suggests that there is a conflict between augment addition and processes such as replacement  of LAṄ and introduction of the vikaraṇa yaK, and by nityatva and antaraṅgatva respectively  these two processes defeat the addition of the augment aṬ.22 

We may conclude that the tradition comes up with a tailored solution to this problem. In  contrast with this, my method eliminates the need to rely on post-Pāṇinian tools and  paribhāṣās. My respective interpretations of 1.4.13 and 6.4.1 ensure that the addition of the  augment, which is taught in the aṅgādhikāra, takes place only after samprasāraṇa, which is  taught outside the aṅgādhikāra. As a result of this, 6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ does not  become applicable until 6.4.72 āḍ ajādīnām, which is its exception, also becomes applicable.  6.4.72 wins, thereby giving the correct form aupyata. 

In sum, these four examples prove that my interpretations of 1.4.13 and 6.4.1 respectively are  correct. In all four derivations, the tradition applies rules in a haphazard order, as a result of  which it often gets the wrong form at the end of the derivation. It is forced to come up with  individual solutions for each of these problems. 

It is also noteworthy that in cases of the type ‘base + affix (1) + affix (2)’, Pāṇini teaches those  processes which contribute towards the construction of the aṅga with respect to affix (2) before  

21 A single vr̥ddhi vowel replaces both āṬ and the vowel following it. 

22 Iha aijyata, aupyata, auhyata iti laṅi kr̥te lāvasthāyām aḍāgamād antaraṅgatvāl lādeśaḥ kriyate,  tatra kr̥te vikaraṇo nityatvād aḍāgamaṁ bādhate ‘Here [with reference to the derivation of the forms] aijyata, aupyata, auhyata, after the addition of the affix LAṄ, in that state of the lakāra, by  antaraṅgatva, the substitution of the lakāra is done [rather than] the addition of the augment aṬ, and  thereafter, by nityatva, the [addition of] vikaraṇa defeats [the insertion of] augment aṬ.’

1206.4.1, in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial order. For example, he teaches the addition of vikaraṇas in  pāda 3.1 and vowel sandhi, reduplication and samprasāraṇa in pāda 6.1. 

### 4.3 Examples of DOI Conflict 

Now I will discuss examples of DOI conflict, which are of interest to the tradition, and show  how my interpretation of 1.4.2 is able to solve these cases. I will also consistently apply my  interpretations of 1.4.13 and 6.4.1 respectively in all these examples.  

In each example, I will prove the existence of DOI conflict and apply my interpretation of 1.4.2  to solve it. As stated in chapter 2, generally speaking, to deal with examples of DOI conflict,  the tradition uses nityatva (for cases of unidirectional blocking), niravakāśatva or its interpretation of 1.4.2, as per convenience. To avoid repetition, I will not mention the  traditional solution for each example below. 

Note that almost all cases of DOI conflict in derivations of finite verbs and primary derivatives  involve unidirectional, and not mutual blocking. We will investigate this further later in this  chapter. 

Lastly, also note that kr̥danta forms are prātipadikas by 1.2.46 kr̥ttaddhitasamāsāś ca and thus  they can take suP affixes by 4.1.1 ṅyāpprātipadikāt. However, in the examples I have discussed  in this section, I have not added suP affixes to kr̥danta forms. This is purely to avoid repetition and redundancy. This does not affect the derivations discussed in this chapter.23 For example,  the first derivation śvi + Ktvā should actually begin in the following manner: śvi + Ktvā 🡪 śvi  + Ktvā + sU (4.1.2 su-au-jas…)🡪 śvi + Ktvā (1.1.40 ktvātosunkasunaḥ, 2.4.82 avyayād  āpsupaḥ). Here onwards, the derivation proceeds as follows: 

23 I have included the kr̥danta derivation sad + KvasU + Ṅas in the previous chapter because there, nominal inflection plays a crucial role in helping us obtain the correct form. 

121 

1. śvi + Ktvā – ‘to swell’, absolutive 

śvi + Ktvā 

 6.1.15 7.2.35 

6.1.15 vacisvapiyajādīnām kiti: roots vac ‘to speak’, svap ‘to sleep’, and those headed by yaj ‘to perform sacrifice’ undergo samprasāraṇa when an affix marked with K follows. 

7.2.35 ārdhadhātukasyeḍ valādeḥ: augment iṬ is attached to an ārdhadhātuka affix beginning  with vaL (any consonant except y). 

If iṬ is attached to Ktvā by 7.2.35, then according to 1.2.18 na ktvā seṭ (which teaches that a  Ktvā which has taken the augment iṬ is not treated as marked with K), itvā will no longer be  treated as marked with K. And so, 6.1.15, which applies to certain roots which are followed by  a K-marked affix, will not be applicable at the following step. So, 7.2.35 blocks 6.1.15. On the  other hand, 7.2.35 will still be applicable after the application of 6.1.15. So, 6.1.15 does not  block 7.2.35. This is a case of unidirectional blocking and thus of DOI conflict. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 7.2.35 wins and we get: śvi + itvā. Since itvā can  no longer be treated as marked with K, 7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ24 causes guṇa of  i, thereby giving us śve + itvā. By 6.1.78 eco’yavāyāvaḥ, we get the correct form: śvayitvā. 

2. han + Kta – ‘to kill’, past passive participle 

h a n + Kta 

 6.4.15 6.4.37 

6.4.15 anunāsikasya kvijhaloḥ kṅiti: the penultimate vowel of a base which ends in a nasal  (anunāsika), is replaced with its long counterpart when affix KvI, or an affix beginning with  jhaL ‘a non-nasal stop or a fricative’ and marked with K or Ṅ follows. 

6.4.37 anudāttopadeśavanatitanotyādīnām anunāsikalopo jhali kṅiti: the final nasal of a base  marked with anudātta when taught in the Dhātupāṭha, as well as of vanA ‘to like’ and the roots  

24 Guṇa replaces the final sound iK (i, u, r̥, l̥) of a verbal base when a sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows.

122 

headed by tanU ‘to extend’, is replaced with LOPA when an affix beginning with jhaL ‘a non nasal stop or a fricative’ and marked with K or Ṅ follows. 

If n of han is replaced with LOPA by 6.4.37, 6.4.15 will not be applicable at the following step.  But if the vowel of han is lengthened by 6.4.15, 6.4.37 will still be applicable at the following  step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.37 and get the correct form hata. 

3. han + jhi – ‘to kill’, present third-person plural 

As per my interpretation of 1.4.13, han cannot be called an aṅga with respect to jhi. Thus, rules  from the aṅgādhikāra are not applicable at this step. I will not repeat this clarification  henceforth and will assume that the reader is by now familiar with it. 

han + jhi 🡪 han + ŚaP + jhi (3.1.68 kartari śap25) 🡪 han + LUK + jhi (2.4.72  adiprabhr̥tibhyaḥ śapaḥ26). Now han and LUK cannot undergo any other operations which are  not triggered by jhi, so han + LUK can be written as han, which is an aṅga with respect to jhi.  Here, the following rules from the aṅgādhikāra (6.4 to 7.4) are applicable: 

h a n + jhi 

 6.4.15 6.4.37 7.1.3 

6.4.15 anunāsikasya kvijhaloḥ kṅiti: same as above. 

6.4.37 anudāttopadeśavanatitanotyādīnām anunāsikalopo jhali kṅiti: same as above. 7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ: a jh which constitutes the initial sound of an affix is replaced with ant. 

We already know from the previous example that there is a Type 2a (DOI conflict) between  6.4.15 and 6.4.37, and that 6.4.37 wins. So now let us consider the relationship between 6.4.37  and 7.1.3.  

25 Affix ŚaP occurs after a verbal root when a sārvadhātuka affix which denotes kartr̥ ‘agent’ follows. 26 Affix ŚaP is replaced with LUK when it occurs after one of the roots headed by adA ‘to eat’ in the  Dhātupāṭha.

123 

If we apply 6.4.37 at this step, 7.1.3 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply  7.1.3 at this step, the affix will no longer begin with a jhaL sound, and therefore 6.4.37 will not  be applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI  conflict. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 7.1.3 wins, and we get han + anti 🡪 hn  + anti (6.4.98 gamahanajanakhanaghasāṁ lopaḥ kṅity anaṅi27) 🡪 ghnanti (7.3.54 ho hanter  ñṇinneṣu28), which is the correct form. 

4. kramU + Ktvā – ‘to stride’, absolutive 

kramU + Ktvā 

 6.4.18 7.2.56 

6.4.18 kramaś ca ktvi: the penultimate vowel of kramU ‘stride’, is optionally replaced with its  long counterpart when affix Ktvā, beginning with jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative), follows. 

7.2.56 udito vā: augment iṬ is, optionally, attached to affix Ktvā when it follows a verbal root  marked with U. 

If, by 7.2.56, the iṬ augment is attached to Ktvā, then 6.4.18, which requires the affix to begin  a specific kind of consonant, will not be applicable at the following step. But if we apply 6.4.18,  7.2.56 will still be applicable at the following step. 

This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.2.56 and get the correct form: kramitvā.  

Note that both 6.4.18 and 7.2.56 are optional rules. So, for each of these rules we have a choice.  We can either implement the rule or not do so. Let us consider what happens in different  scenarios: 

27 The penultimate sound of gam ‘to go’, han ‘to kill’, jan ‘to be born’, khan ‘to dig’ and ghas ‘to eat’,  is replaced with LOPA when an affix beginning with a vowel and marked with K or Ṅ, except aṄ,  follows. 

28 The h of han ‘to harm, kill’ is replaced with a velar stop when an affix marked with Ñ and Ṇ, or  simply n (i.e., after LOPA of a) follows.

124 

If we do not implement the optional rule 7.2.56, we get: 

(i) krantvā, if we do not implement the optional rule 6.4.18; and 

(ii) krāntvā, if we do implement the optional rule 6.4.18. 

If we implement 7.2.56 but not 6.4.18, we get, again, krāntvā. 

All three forms, krantvā, krāntvā and kramitvā are correct. 

5. atikram + Ktvā – ‘to surpass’, absolutive 

 atikram + Ktvā  

 6.4.18 7.1.3729 

6.4.18 kramaś ca ktvi: same as above. 

7.1.37 samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap: in a compound, the first member of which is not naÑ, the  affix Ktvā in the second member of the compound is replaced with LyaP. 

If we apply 7.1.37, LyaP replaces Ktvā and so 6.4.18 will not be applicable at the following  step. But if we apply 6.4.18, 7.1.37 will still be applicable at the following step. This is a case  of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.37 and get the correct form:  atikramya. 

It is important to point out an anomaly here. Pāṇini’s rule 2.2.18 kugatiprādayaḥ teaches that  the particle ku, items termed gati (including ati) and items belonging to the group headed by  pra (which also includes ati) combine with syntactically related padas to form tatpuruṣa compounds. We know, thanks to 2.1.4 saha supā, that a compound is composed of forms  ending in suP. Since the three forms krantvā / krāntvā / kramitvā (see example 4 of this section)  

29 Note that, here, an SOI takes place between 7.1.37 samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap and 7.2.56 udito vā.  7.1.37 wins because it has been specifically taught for compounds. Here, since the focus is on DOI  conflict, I have avoided mentioning this and other such SOI relationships where it was possible to avoid  them. 

125 

end in suP (which is replaced with LUK by 2.4.82 avyayād āpsupaḥ), ati can combine with any  of these forms to construct a tatpuruṣa compound. Let us consider each of the three scenarios: 

a. Compound between ati and krantvā.  

By 7.1.37 samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap, we replace Ktvā with LyaP and get *atikranya, which  is not the correct form. 

b. Compound between ati and krāntvā. 

By 7.1.37, we replace Ktvā with LyaP and get *atikrānya, which is also not the correct form. c. Compound between ati and kramitvā.  

By 7.1.37 samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap, we replace Ktvā with LyaP and get atikramiya 🡪 *atikramitya (6.1.71 hrasvasya piti kr̥ti tuk), which is not the correct form. 

To derive the correct form, we have to start the derivation by adding the verbal root kram to ati which constitutes the pūrvapada. To that, we add affix Ktvā: atikram + Ktvā. This alone  gives us the correct answer.30 We see the same phenomenon in examples 6-8 below. But this  runs contrary to how we generally construct compounds – by combining two or more subanta  forms. 

Thus, the following question arises: if it is difficult to derive atikramya correctly as a  compound, why does Pāṇini want us to view atikramya as a compound in the first place? This  likely has to do with accentuation, which is not the focus of this thesis. The distinction between  atikramya and atikrāmati (where ati is only a morpho-syntactically bound particle cf. 1.4.8 te  prāg dhātoḥ), the status of particles like ati in Vedic and the relationship between Ktvā and  LyaP in Vedic can all shed more light on this matter, but we cannot delve into these topics  here. 

30 The tradition too takes cognizance of this. Vyāḍi suggests that an operation involving the upasarga and the verbal base is antaraṅga: dhātūpasargayor antaraṅgaṁ kāryam bhavati (Pbh 37 of  Paribhāṣāsūcanam). We know that an antaraṅga operation gets precedence over a bahiraṅga  operation.

126 

6. prasthā + Ktvā – ‘to depart’, absolutive 

prasthā + Ktvā 

 7.4.40 7.1.37  

7.4.40 dyatisyatimāsthām it ti kiti: a short i replaces the final sound of do ‘to cut’, ṣo ‘to end,  terminate’, mā ‘to measure’ and sthā ‘to stay’, when a t-initial affix marked with K follows. 

7.1.37 samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap: same as above. 

If we replace Ktvā with LyaP by 7.1.37, the affix no longer begins with t and thus 7.4.40 will  not be applicable at the following step. On the other hand, if we apply 7.4.40, 7.1.37 will still  be applicable at the following step.  

This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.37 which gives the correct form:  prasthāya. 

7. āgam + Ktvā – ‘to come’, absolutive 

āgam + Ktvā 

 6.4.37 7.1.37  

6.4.37 anudāttopadeśavanatitanotyādīnām anunāsikalopo jhali kṅiti: the final nasal of a base  marked with anudātta when taught in the Dhātupāṭha, as well as of vanA ‘to like’ and the roots  headed by tanU ‘to extend’, is replaced with LOPA when an affix beginning with jhaL (a non nasal stop or a fricative) and marked with K or Ṅ follows. 

7.1.37 samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap: same as above. 

If we replace Ktvā with LyaP by 7.1.37, the affix no longer begins with jhaL and thus 6.4.37 will not be applicable at the following step. On the other hand, if we apply 6.4.37, 7.1.37 will  still be applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict. 

127 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.37 and get: āgam + tvā 🡪 āgam +  ya (7.1.37) 🡪 āga + ya (6.4.38 vā lyapi31) 🡪 āgatya (6.1.71 hrasvasya piti kr̥ti tuk32), which  is the correct form. Note that the application of 6.4.38 is optional. If we do not implement this  rule, we get āgamya, which is also correct. 

8. praveÑ + Ktvā – ‘to weave’, absolutive 

praveÑ + Ktvā 

 6.1.15 7.1.37 

6.1.15 vacisvapiyajādīnām kiti: roots vac ‘to speak’, svap ‘to sleep’, and those headed by yaj ‘to perform sacrifice’ undergo samprasāraṇa when an affix marked with K follows. 

7.1.37 samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap: same as above. 

If we apply 6.1.15 at this step, 7.1.37 will still be applicable at the following step. But if we  apply 7.1.37 at this step, then by 6.1.41 lyapi ca (which teaches that veÑ does not undergo  samprasāraṇa when LyaP follows), 6.1.15, which teaches samprasāraṇa, will not be  applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI  conflict.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.37 and get: prave + ya 🡪 pravāya  (6.1.45 ād eca upadeśe’śiti33), which is the correct form. 

31 The final nasal of a root marked with anudātta when taught in the Dhātupāṭha (cf. upadeśe), as well  as of vanA ‘to like’ and the roots headed by tanU ‘to extend’, is optionally replaced with LOPA before  the substitute LyaP. 

32 Augment tUK is attached to a root ending in a short vowel when a kr̥t affix marked with P follows. 33 The final sound of a verbal base ending in eC (e, o, ai, au) when taught in the Dhātupāṭha is replaced  with ā, when an affix that is not marked with Ś follows.

128 

9. śās + siP – ‘to instruct’, imperative second-person singular  

śās + siP 

 3.1.68 3.4.87 

3.1.68 kartari śap: affix ŚaP occurs after a verbal root when a sārvadhātuka affix which  denotes kartr̥ ‘agent’ follows. 

3.4.87 ser hy apic ca: a siP replacement of LOṬ is replaced with hi and is treated as if not  marked with P. 

These two rules do not block each other. This is not a case of conflict. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.87 and get śās + hi 🡪 śās + ŚaP +  hi (3.1.68) 🡪 śās + hi (2.4.72 adiprabhr̥tibhyaḥ śapaḥ34). śās can now be called an aṅga with  respect to hi (cf. my interpretation of 1.4.13). Thus, the following rules from the aṅgādhikāra become applicable: 

śās + hi 

 6.4.34 6.4.35 7.1.35 

6.4.34 śāsa id aṅhaloḥ: the penultimate sound of śās, is replaced with short i when followed  by aṄ, or an affix that begins with a consonant and is marked with K or Ṅ.35 

6.4.35 śā hau: śās is replaced with śā when affix hi follows. 

7.1.35 tuhyos tātaṅ āśiṣy anyatarasyām: affixes tu and hi are optionally replaced with tātAṄ,  provided benediction (āśiḥ) is denoted.36 

34 Affix ŚaP is replaced with LUK when it occurs after one of the roots headed by adA ‘to eat’ in the  Dhātupāṭha. 

35 hi is an apit (cf. 3.4.87 ser hy apic ca) sārvadhātuka, and so by 1.2.4 sārvadhātukam apit, it can be  treated as marked with K or Ṅ. Thus, 6.4.34 is applicable here.  

36 For a discussion on how this rule should be interpreted using Pāṇini’s metarules, see Appendix A. 

129 

Here, we see that there is an SOI interaction between 6.4.34 and 6.4.3537 and a DOI interaction  between them and 7.1.35. Let’s first deal with the SOI between 6.4.34 and 6.4.35. 6.4.35 is  more specific because it pertains to the hi affix alone and thus wins38. So now let us discuss the  relationship between 6.4.35 and 7.1.35. 

If we apply 6.4.35, 7.1.35 will still be applicable at the following step. But if we apply 7.1.35,  hi will be replaced with tātAṄ and thus 6.4.35 will not be applicable at the following step. This  is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.35 and get: śās + tāt 🡪 śis + tāt (6.4.34 śāsa idaṅhaloḥ) 🡪 śiṣṭāt (8.3.60 śāsivasighasīnāṁ ca, 8.4.41 ṣṭunā ṣṭuḥ), which is the  correct form. 

10. han + siP – ‘to hurt’, imperative second-person singular 

han + siP 

 3.1.68 3.4.87  

3.1.68 kartari śap: same as above. 

3.4.87 ser hy apic ca: same as above.  

Neither of the two rules blocks the other. This is a case of DOI non-conflict. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.87 and get han + hi 🡪 han + ŚaP +  hi (3.1.68) 🡪 han + hi (2.4.72 adiprabhr̥tibhyaḥ śapaḥ). han can now be called an aṅga with  respect to hi (cf. my interpretation of 1.4.13). Thus, the following rules from the aṅgādhikāra become applicable: 

37 The operand of 6.4.34 is a part of the operand of 6.4.35 and so, like in the previous chapters, here  too, we classify such interactions as Type 1 (SOI).  

38 Note that 6.4.35 is asiddhavat with respect to 6.4.34, but in my view, this does not affect the way in  which we deal with SOI. I will discuss this further in the next chapter. 

130han + hi 

 6.4.36 6.4.37 7.1.35 

6.4.36 hanter jaḥ: the root han is replaced with ja when the affix hi follows. 

6.4.37 anudāttopadeśavanatitanotyādīnām anunāsikalopo jhali kṅiti: the final nasal of a base  marked with anudātta when taught in the Dhātupāṭha, as well as of vanA ‘to like’ and the roots  headed by tanU ‘to extend’, is replaced with LOPA when an affix beginning with jhaL (a non nasal stop or a fricative) and marked with K or Ṅ follows.39 

7.1.35 tuhyos tātaṅ āśiṣy anyatarasyām: same as above. 

There is an SOI relationship between 6.4.36 and 6.4.37. 6.4.36 is specifically taught for han +  hi and so it is clearly more specific than 6.4.37. So, we put 6.4.37 aside. Now let us consider  the relationship between 6.4.36 and 7.1.35. 

If we apply 6.4.36 at this step, 7.1.35 will still be applicable at the following step. However, if  we replace hi with tātAṄ by 7.1.35 at this step, then 6.4.36, which applies only when han is  followed by hi, will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional  blocking and thus of DOI conflict.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.35 and get han + tātAṄ 🡪 hatāt (6.4.37 anudāttopadeśavanatitanotyādīnām anunāsikalopo jhali kṅiti), which is the correct  form. 

39 Since hi is an apit sārvadhātuka, it can be treated as marked with K by 1.2.4 sārvadhātukam apit.  Thus 6.4.37 is applicable. 

131 

11. radh + ṆiC40 – ‘to subdue’, causative present third-person singular 

radh is an aṅga with respect to ṆiC. ṆiC can trigger two operations from the aṅgādhikāra on  radh namely 7.2.116 and 7.1.67.  

 r a dh + ṆiC  

 7.2.116 7.1.61 3.2.123  7.2.116 ata upadhāyāḥ: a vowel termed vr̥ddhi replaces the penultimate sound a of a verbal  base when an affix marked with Ṇ or Ñ follows. 

7.1.61 radhijabhor aci: augment nUM is attached to radhA ‘to subdue’ and jabhA ‘to gape’  when an affix beginning with a vowel follows. 

3.2.123 vartamāne laṭ: affix LAṬ occurs after a verbal root when the action is denoted at the  current time (vartamāna). 

3.2.123 neither blocks nor is blocked by the other two rules. Let us look at the relationship  between 7.2.116 and 7.1.61.  

If we apply 7.2.116, 7.1.61 will still be applicable at the following step. However, if we apply  7.1.61, that is, if we insert the augment nUM before the final dh (cf. 1.1.47 mid aco’ntyāt  paraḥ), then a is no longer the penultimate sound, and so 7.2.116 will not be applicable at the  following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right-most rule 3.2.123 get radh + ṆiC + LAṬ. Here, the following rules are applicable: 

 r a dh + ṆiC + LAṬ 

 7.2.116 7.1.61 3.4.78 7.2.116 ata upadhāyāḥ: same as above. 

7.1.61 radhijabhor aci: same as above. 

3.4.78 tip-tas-jhi-sip-thas-tha-mib-vas-mas-ta-ātāṁ-jha-thās-āthāṁ-dhvam-iḍ-vahi-mahiṅ 40 3.1.26 hetumati ca.

132 

We have already discussed the relationship between 7.2.116 and 7.1.61. 3.4.78 neither blocks  nor is blocked by the other two rules. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right most rule 3.4.78 and get radh + ṆiC + tiP. At this step, multiple rules are applicable: 

 r a dh + ṆiC + tiP 

 7.2.116 7.1.61 3.1.68 

7.2.116 ata upadhāyāḥ: same as above. 

7.1.61 radhijabhor aci: same as above. 

3.1.68 kartari śap: same as above. 

We have already discussed the relationship between 7.2.116 and 7.1.61. 3.1.68 neither blocks  nor is blocked by the other two rules. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right most rule 3.1.68 and get: radh + ṆiC + ŚaP  + tiP. At this point, two rules are applicable: 

 r a dh + ṆiC + ŚaP + tiP 

 7.2.116 7.1.61  

We have already established that there is a DOI conflict between 7.2.116 and 7.1.61.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.61 and get randh + ṆiC + ŚaP + tiP. randh and ṆiC cannot undergo any other operations which are not triggered by ŚaP, so we can  write randh + ṆiC as randhi. randhi is an aṅga with respect to ŚaP. Thus by 7.3.84  sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ41, which belongs to the aṅgādhikāra and is triggered here by  ŚaP, is applicable to randhi. Upon its application, we get randhe + a + ti 🡪 randhaya + ti (6.1.78 eco’yavāyāvaḥ) 🡪 randhayati, which is the correct form.  

41 Guṇa replaces the final sound iK of a verbal base when a sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows.

133 

12. glai + tiP – ‘to become tired’, present third-person singular 

glai + tiP 

 6.1.45 3.1.68  

6.1.45 ād eca upadeśe’śiti: the final sound of a verbal root which ends in eC when taught in  the Dhātupāṭha is replaced with ā, when an affix which is not marked with Ś follows. 

3.1.68 kartari śap: same as above. 

If we apply 6.1.45 at this step, 3.1.68 will be applicable at the following step. But if we add the  affix ŚaP at this step by 3.1.68, then 6.1.45 will not be applicable at the following step.  

This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict. 

By my application of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.1.68 and get the correct form: glai + a +  ti 🡪 glāyati (6.1.78 eco’yavāyāvaḥ). 

13. dr̥ś + tumUN – ‘to see’, infinitive 

d r̥ ś + tumUN 

 7.3.86 6.1.58 

7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca: guṇa replaces iK (i, u, r̥, l̥) of a verbal base which ends in  the augment pUK or which has a laghu ‘light’ vowel as its penultimate sound when a  sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows. 

6.1.58 sr̥jidr̥śor jhaly am akiti: augment aM is attached to verbal roots sr̥j ‘to release, project’  and dr̥śIR ‘to look’ before an affix which begins with a jhaL, but is not marked with K. 

If we apply 7.3.86 at this step, 6.1.58 will still be applicable at the following step. But if we  apply 6.1.58 at this step, r̥ will no longer be the penultimate vowel and so 7.3.86 will not be  applicable at the following step. 

This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.1.58 and get dr̥aś + tum 🡪 draś + tum (6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci) 🡪 draṣ + tum (8.2.36 vraścabhrasjasr̥jamr̥jayajarājabhrājacchaśāṁ ṣaḥ) 🡪 draṣṭum (8.4.41  ṣṭunā ṣṭuḥ), which is the correct form.

134 

14. bhū + tiP – ‘to be’, aorist third-person singular  

bhū + ti 

 3.1.43 3.4.100 

3.1.43 cli luṅi: affix cli is added to a verbal root when LUṄ follows. 

3.4.100 itaś ca: the i of a replacement of any lakāra marked with Ṅ, is replaced with LOPA. 

There is no conflict between the two rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS  rule 3.4.100 and get: bhū + t. At this step, only one rule, namely 3.1.43 is applicable. On  applying this rule, we get bhū + cli + tiP. Since bhū is an aṅga with respect to cli, 7.3.84 from  the aṅgādhikāra is applicable here, and so is 3.1.44: 

bhū + cli + t 

 7.3.84 3.1.44 

7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ: guṇa replaces the final sound iK of a verbal base when  a sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows. 

3.1.44 cleḥ sic: cli is replaced with sIC. 

There is no conflict between these two rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS  rule 3.1.44 and get bhū + sIC + t. Here three rules are applicable: 

 bhū + sIC + t 

 7.3.84 7.2.1 2.4.77 

7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ: same as above. 

7.2.1 sici vr̥ddhiḥ parasmaipadeṣu: the final sound iK of a verbal base is replaced with its  vr̥ddhi counterpart before a sIC that is followed by a parasmaipada affix. 

2.4.77 gātisthāghupābhūbhyaḥ sicaḥ parasmaipadeṣu: affix sIC is replaced with LUK when it  is located after gā ‘to go’, sthā ‘to stand’, ghu ‘a root termed ghu’, pā ‘to drink’, or bhū ‘to be,  become’ and before a parasmaipada affix.

135 

There is an SOI relationship between 7.3.84 and 7.2.1. Since 7.2.1 has been taught for bases  followed by sIC, it is more specific and thus wins. Now let us look at the relationship between  7.2.1 and 2.4.77. 

If we apply 7.2.1 at this step, 2.4.77 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply  2.4.77 at this step, 7.2.1 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of  unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 2.4.77 and get bhū + t. bhū can now be  called an aṅga with respect to t. Note that t cannot trigger guṇa of the ū of bhū due to the  following rule: 

7.3.88 bhūsuvos tiṅi: a guṇa vowel does not replace the iK of bhū ‘to be’ and sū ‘to give birth  to’ when a sārvadhātuka tiṄ affix follows.  

So only one rule from the aṅgādhikāra, namely 6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ, which is  triggered by t is applicable. It teaches that the udātta augment aṬ is attached to a verbal base  when affixes LUṄ, LAṄ and LR̥Ṅ follow. On applying this rule, we get the correct form: abhūt.  

15. grah + tiP – ‘to obtain’, aorist third-person singular 

The first couple of steps of this derivation are similar to the previous one. I will mention them in brief here and focus on the step which involves conflict. 

grah + tiP 🡪 grah + t (3.4.100 itaś ca) 🡪 grah + cli + t (3.1.43 cli luṅi) 🡪 grah + sIC + t (3.1.44 cleḥ sic). 

grah + sIC + t 

 7.2.3 7.2.35 

7.2.3 vadavrajahalantasyācaḥ: a vowel termed vr̥ddhi replaces the vowel of vad ‘to speak’,  vraj ‘to wander’, and a verbal base ending in a consonant, before a sIC which is followed by a  parasmaipada affix. 

7.2.35 ārdhadhātukasyeḍ valādeḥ: augment iṬ is attached to an ārdhadhātuka affix beginning  with vaL (any consonant except y).

136 

If we apply 7.2.3 at this step, 7.2.35 will be applicable at the following step. But if we attach  the augment iṬ to sIC by 7.2.35 at this step, 7.2.3 will not be applicable at the following step,  due to 7.2.5: 

7.2.5 hmyantakṣaṇaśvasajāgr̥ṇiśvyeditām: a vowel termed vr̥ddhi does not come in place of  the vowel of verbal bases (i) ending in h, m, y; or (ii) kṣaṇA ‘to harm’, śvasA ‘to breathe’ and jāgr̥ ‘to wake up’; or (iii) ending in the affix Ṇi; or (iv) śvi ‘to swell’; or (v) marked with E; before an iṬ-initial sIC which is followed by a parasmaipada affix.42 

In conclusion, if we apply 7.2.35 at this step, 7.2.3 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.2.35 and get grah + is + t. grah and is cannot undergo any other operations which are not triggered by t, thus we can write grah + is as grahis. grahis is an aṅga with respect to t. The following rules from the aṅgādhikāra become  applicable: 

grahis + t 

 6.4.71 7.3.96 

6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ: same as above. 

7.3.96 astisico’pr̥kte: augment īṬ is attached to a consonant-initial sārvadhātuka affix which  consists of only one sound (apṛkta) and occurs after the verbal base as or affix sIC. 

There is no conflict between these rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2 we apply the RHS rule  7.3.96 and get grahis + īt. At this step, we apply 6.4.71 and get agrahis + īt. Now that all  possible rules from the sapādasaptādhyāyī have been applied, we apply 8.2.28 iṭa īṭi from the  

42 One may ask: why did Pāṇini compose 7.2.5 if 7.2.4 neṭi already prohibits vr̥ddhi in such cases? It is  true that by 7.2.4 neṭi, when the consonant-final base is followed by an iṬ-initial sIC, vr̥ddhi is  prohibited. But 7.2.7 ato halāder laghoḥ makes this optional for bases which start with a consonant and  contain the light vowel a. Thus, Pāṇini has composed 7.2.5 to negate this optionality, or in other words,  to prescribe the mandatory prohibition of vr̥ddhi in the said circumstances. 

137 

tripādī which replaces the s between iṬ and īṬ with LOPA. This gives us the correct form:  agrahiīt 🡪 agrahīt (6.1.101 akaḥ savarṇe dīrghaḥ).43 

16. gupU + tiP – ‘to hide’, aorist third-person singular44 

gup + tiP 

 3.1.43 3.4.100 

3.1.43 cli luṅi: same as above. 

3.4.100 itaś ca: same as above. 

There is no conflict between these two rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS  rule 3.4.100 and get gup + t. By my interpretation of 1.4.13, gup is not an aṅga with respect to  t, so rules like 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca which are taught in the aṅgādhikāra and which  are triggered by t cannot apply here. By applying 3.1.43, we get gup + cli + t. Here the  following rules are applicable: 

gup + cli + t 

 7.3.86 3.1.44 

7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca: guṇa replaces the iK (i, u, r̥, l̥) of a verbal base which ends  in the augment pUK or which has a laghu ‘light’ vowel as its penultimate sound when a  sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows. 

3.1.44 cleḥ sic: same as above. 

There is no conflict between the two rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS  rule 3.1.44 and get: gup + sIC + t. Here multiple rules are applicable: 

43 An important question arises here: how is it possible to apply 6.1.101, after applying 8.2.28, which  belongs to the asiddha section? Unfortunately, I have not been able to find a satisfactory explanation  for this. 

44 By 3.1.31 āyādaya ārdhadhātuke vā, āya can be optionally added to gupU here, but we will not  discuss this option because it is not relevant to the present argument.

138 

 gup + sIC + t 

 7.3.86 7.2.3 7.2.44 

7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca: same as above.  

7.2.3 vadavrajahalantasyācaḥ: same as above.  

7.2.44 svarati-sūti-sūyati-dhūñ-ūdito vā: augment iṬ is introduced to an ārdhadhātuka affix  which begins with vaL (any consonant except y), provided the same occurs after svr̥ ‘resound’,  ṣūṄ (adādi) ‘give birth to’, ṣūṄ (divādi) ‘give birth to’, dhūÑ ‘to shake’, and roots marked with  Ū. 

There is an SOI relationship between 7.3.86 and 7.2.3. 7.2.3 has been taught specifically for a  set of verbs followed by sIC, and thus wins. Now let us look at the DOI relationship between  7.2.44 and 7.2.3.  

If we apply 7.2.3 at this step, 7.2.44 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply  7.2.44 at this step, then 7.2.3 will not be applicable at the following step, because of 7.2.4 neṭi which prohibits vr̥ddhi of the vowel of a consonant-final base when the following sIC has taken  the augment iṬ. 

This is a case of unidirectional blocking and thus of DOI conflict. By my interpretation of 1.4.2,  we apply the RHS rule 7.2.44 and get gup + is + t. By 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca, we  get gop + is + t. Note that, gop and is cannot undergo any other operations which are not  triggered by t. Thus, we can write gop + is as gopis. gopis is an aṅga with respect to t.  

I will not go into the depth of the remaining steps of this derivation because we have seen these  steps in a similar derivation above: gopis + t 🡪 gopis + īt (7.3.96 astisico’pr̥kte) 🡪 agopis +  īt (6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ) 🡪 agopi + īt (8.2.28 iṭa īṭi) 🡪 agopīt (6.1.101 akaḥ savarṇe  dīrghaḥ), which is the correct form.  

If we do not implement the optional rule 7.2.44, we get: gup + s + t 🡪 gaups + t (7.2.3  vadavrajahalantasyācaḥ) 🡪 gaups + īt (7.3.96 astisico’pr̥kte) 🡪 agaupsīt (6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ṅṣv  aḍ udāttaḥ), which is also correct. 

139 

17. bhid + ta – ‘to break’, aorist third-person singular 

bhid + ta 🡪 bhid + cli + ta (3.1.43 cli luṅi)  

bhid + cli + ta 

 7.3.86 3.1.44 

3.1.44 cleḥ sic: same as above. 

7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca: same as above. 

If we apply 7.3.86 at this step, 3.1.44 will be applicable at the following step. But, if we apply  3.1.44 at this step, 7.3.86 will not be applicable at the following step because of 1.2.11: 

1.2.11 liṅsicāv ātmanepadeṣu: a LIṄ or sIC affix which begins with a jhaL (a non-nasal stop  or a fricative) and occurs after a consonant preceded by an iK (i, u, ṛ, ḷ) is treated as if marked  with K, before ātmanepada endings. 

By 1.2.11 sIC is treated as marked with K. So, if we apply 3.1.44 at this step, sIC, marked by  K, will not trigger guṇa (here, 7.3.86), thanks to 1.1.5 kṅiti ca, at the following step. 

This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.1.44 and get bhid + s + ta 🡪 bhids +  ta 🡪 abhids + ta (6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ) 🡪 abhidta (8.2.26 jhalo jhali) 🡪 abhitta (8.4.55 khari ca), which is the correct form. 

18. ūrṇuÑ + tiP – ‘to cover’, simple future third-person singular 

ūrṇuÑ + tiP 🡪 ūrṇuÑ + sya + tiP (3.1.33 syatāsī lr̥luṭoḥ). 

ūrṇu + sya + tiP 

 7.3.84 7.2.35 

7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ: guṇa replaces the final iK (i, u, ṛ, ḷ) of a verbal base when  a sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows. 

7.2.35 ārdhadhātukasyeḍ valādeḥ: augment iṬ is attached to an ārdhadhātuka affix beginning with vaL (any consonant except y).

140If we apply 7.3.84 at this step, 7.2.35 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply  7.2.35 at this step, 7.3.84 will not be applicable at the following step due to 1.2.3: 

1.2.3 vibhāṣorṇoḥ: an affix with initial augment iṬ is optionally treated as marked with Ṅ when  it occurs after ūrṇuÑ.  

So, if we apply 7.2.35, and treat the resultant iṣya as marked with Ṅ, then by 1.1.5 kṅiti ca,  7.3.84 will not be applicable at the following step. 

This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.2.35 and get: ūrṇu + iṣya + ti 🡪 ūrṇuviṣyati (6.4.77 aci śnudhātubhruvāṁ yvor iyaṅuvaṅau45). 

On the other hand, if we do not implement the optional rule 1.2.3, then the derivation proceeds  as follows: ūrṇu + iṣya + tiP (7.2.35 ārdhadhātukasyeḍ valādeḥ) 🡪 ūrṇo + iṣya + tip (7.3.84  sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ) 🡪 ūrṇaviṣyati (6.1.78 eco’yavāyāvaḥ). 

19. bhū + tiP – ‘to be’, āśīrliṅ (benedictive) third-person singular 

Since no vikaraṇa is added between bhū and tiP in āśīrliṅ forms, at this step, bhū can be called  an aṅga with respect to tiP.  

 bhū + t i 

 7.3.84 3.4.103 3.4.100 7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ: same as above.  

3.4.103 yāsuṭ parasmaipadeṣūdātto ṅic ca: udātta ‘high-pitched’ augment yāsUṬ is attached  to parasmaipada substitutes of LIṄ, and is treated as marked with Ṅ. 

3.4.100 itaś ca: the i of a replacement of any lakāra marked with Ṅ, is replaced with LOPA. 

3.4.100 neither blocks nor is blocked by the other two rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we  apply the right most rule 3.4.100 and get bhū + t. Here two rules are applicable: 

45 The final i and u of Śnu, and of any verbal base, and of bhrū ‘brow’ are replaced with iyAṄ and uvAṄ,  respectively, when an affix beginning with a vowel (aC) follows.

141 

 bhū + t  

 7.3.84 3.4.103  

If we apply 7.3.84 at this step, 3.4.103 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply  3.4.103 at this step, 7.3.84, which prescribes guṇa of ū, will not be applicable at the following  step. This is because, yāsUṬ is marked with Ṅ and thus by 1.1.5 kṅiti ca, guṇa is blocked.  

This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.103 and get bhū + yāst. Here, again,  two rules are applicable: 

bhūyā [st] 

 8.2.23 8.2.29 

8.2.23 saṁyogāntasya lopaḥ: the final sound of a conjunct which occurs at the end of a pada is replaced with LOPA. 

8.2.29 skoḥ saṁyogādyor ante ca: the initial s and k of a conjunct which occurs at the end of a  pada, or is followed by jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative), is replaced with LOPA. 

Note that both 8.2.23 and 8.2.29 belong to the tripādī section. So, 8.2.29 is asiddha with respect  to 8.2.23. However, this does not impact our method of resolving the SOI between them. I will  discuss this in chapter 5. 

8.2.29 has been taught for a specific set of conjuncts and thus wins, thereby leading to the  correct form: bhūyāt.

142 

20. naś + tavyaT – ‘to perish’, optative passive participle 

na ś + tavyaT 

 7.1.60 7.2.45 

7.1.60 masjinaśor jhali: augment nUM is attached to ṬUmasjI ‘to sink, immerse’ and naś ‘to perish’ when an affix beginning with jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative) follows. 

7.2.45 radhādibhyaś ca: augment iṬ is optionally attached to ārdhadhātuka affixes beginning  with vaL (any consonant except y) and occurring after the set of verbal roots beginning with  radhA ‘to be subdued’.46 

If we apply 7.1.60 at this step, 7.2.45 will still be applicable at the following step. But if we  apply 7.2.45 at this step, then the affix no longer begins with a jhaL sound, so 7.1.60 will not  be applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking and thus of DOI  conflict.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.2.45 and get: naśitavya, which is the  correct form. If we do not implement the optional rule 7.2.45, we get: naṁṣṭavya, which is also  correct. 

46 This set of roots includes naś.

143 

21. tr̥p + tumUN – ‘to be satisfied’, infinitive 

 t r̥ p + tumUN 

 7.3.86 6.1.59 7.2.45 

7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca: guṇa replaces the iK (i, u, r̥, l̥) of a verbal base which ends  in the augment pUK or which has a laghu ‘light’ vowel as its penultimate sound when a  sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows. 

6.1.59 anudāttasya cardupadhasyānyatarasyām: augment aM is optionally introduced to a  verbal root which is anudātta when taught in the Dhātupāṭha and has r̥ as its penultimate sound  when an affix beginning with jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative) and not marked with K,  follows.  

7.2.45 radhādibhyaś ca: same as above. 

Let us first consider what happens if we implement both optional rules 6.1.59 and 7.2.45. 

Let us first look at the relationship between 7.3.86 and 6.1.59. If we apply 7.3.86 at this step,  that will change r̥ to ar, and so 6.1.59, which applies only when the penultimate sound is r̥ will  not be applicable at the following step. If we apply 6.1.59 at this step, r̥ will no longer be the  penultimate sound, so 7.3.86 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of  mutual blocking, and thus of DOI conflict. 

Now let us study the relationship between 6.1.59 and 7.2.45. If we apply 6.1.59 at this step,  7.2.45 will still be applicable at the following step. If we apply 7.2.45 at this step, the affix will  no longer begin with jhaL and thus 6.1.59 will not be applicable at the following step. This is  a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict. 

Lastly, 7.3.86 and 7.2.45 do not block each other. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right-most rule 7.2.45 and get: tr̥p + itum 🡪 tarpitum (7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca), which is the correct form. 

If we implement the optional rule 7.2.45 but not the optional rule 6.1.59, we get the same form:  tarpitum. However, if we implement 6.1.59 but not 7.2.45, we get tr̥ap + tum (6.1.59) 🡪 traptum (6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci), which is also correct. If we do not implement both 7.2.45 and  6.1.59, we get tarptum (7.3.86), which is also correct.

144 

22. divU + Ktvā – ‘to gamble’, absolutive 

 divU + Ktvā 

 6.4.19 7.2.56  

6.4.19 chvoḥ śūḍ anunāsike ca: ch and v of a base are replaced with ś and ūṬH, respectively,  when KvI, or an affix beginning with jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative) and marked with K or Ṅ, or beginning with a nasal, follows. 

7.2.56 udito vā: augment iṬ is optionally attached to affix Ktvā when it follows a verbal root  marked with U. 

If we apply 6.4.19 at this step, 7.2.56 will be applicable at the following step. If we attach  augment iṬ to tvā by 7.2.56 at this step, then by 1.2.18 na ktvā seṭ47, Ktvā cannot be treated as  marked with K. Thus, 6.4.19 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of  unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.2.56 and get: div + itvā. Since itvā cannot be treated as marked with K, it can no longer block guṇa and vr̥ddhi (i.e., 1.1.5 kṅiti ca does not hold). Thus, by 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca, we get devitvā, which is the correct  form. 

If we do not implement the optional rule 7.2.56, we get: div + tvā 🡪 diū + tvā (6.4.19 chvoḥ śūḍ anunāsike ca) 🡪 dyūtvā (6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci), which is also correct. 

47 Ktvā which has taken the iṬ augment is not treated as marked with K.

145 

23. khanU + Ktvā – ‘to dig’, absolutive 

 khanU + Ktvā 

 6.4.42 7.2.56 

6.4.42 janasanakhanāṁ sañjhaloḥ: the final sound of janA ‘to generate’, sanA ‘to gain’, and  khanU ‘to dig’, is replaced with ā when saN or an affix beginning with jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative) and marked with K or Ṅ follows. 

7.2.56 udito vā: same as above. 

If we apply 6.4.42 at this step, 7.2.56 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply  7.2.56 at this step, the affix will no longer begin with jhaL and so 6.4.42 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and of DOI conflict.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.2.56 and get khanitvā, which is the  correct form. 

If we do not implement the optional rule 7.2.56, we get kha-ā + tvā 🡪 khātvā (6.1.101 akaḥ savarṇe dīrghaḥ), which is also correct. 

24. kr̥ + siP – ‘to make’, imperative second-person singular 

kr̥ + siP 

 3.1.79 3.4.87 

3.1.79 tanādikr̥ñbhya uḥ: affix u is added after verbal roots belonging to the set headed by tanU ‘to stretch’ and also after kr̥Ñ ‘to make’ when a sārvadhātuka affix which denotes kartr̥ follows. 

3.4.87 ser hy apic ca: a siP replacement of LOṬ is replaced with hi and is treated as if not  marked with P. 

There is no conflict between these rules.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.87 and get kr̥ + hi. Thereafter, the  derivation proceeds as follows kr̥ + hi 🡪 kr̥ + u + hi (3.1.79 tanādikr̥ñbhya uḥ) 🡪 karu + hi (7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ). karu is an aṅga with respect to hi, so the following  rules from the aṅgādhikāra are applicable:

146 

k a ru + hi 

 6.4.110 6.4.106  

6.4.110 ata ut sārvadhātuke: the a of base which is constituted by kr̥, and ends in affix u, is  replaced with u when a sārvadhātuka affix marked with K or Ṅ follows. 

6.4.106 utaś ca pratyayād asaṁyogapūrvāt: hi is replaced with LUK when it is preceded by a  base that ends in affix u, such that u is not preceded by a conjunct. 

Note that both these rules fall under the heading rule 6.4.22 asiddhavat atrābhāt. I interpret  this rule as: till 6.4.129 bhasya, any rule will treat any other rule here (i.e., in this section) as  asiddhavat’. In my opinion, if A treats B as asiddhavat, A acknowledges the existence of B,  but not the outcome of the application of B’. I will discuss this interpretation in detail in chapter 

5. 

Since 6.4.110 and 6.4.106 acknowledge each other’s existence, we can use 1.4.2 to deal with  this case of DOI. 

If we apply 6.4.110 at this step, 6.4.106 will be applicable at the following step. But if we  replace hi with LUK by 6.4.106, 6.4.110 will not be applicable at the following step48. This is  a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.106 and get karu. Since 6.4.106 is  asiddhavat with respect to 6.4.110, 6.4.110 does not acknowledge the outcome of the  application of 6.4.106. Thus 6.4.110 applies, and we get the correct form: kuru.  

48 1.1.63 na lumatāṅgasya.

147 

25. as + siP – ‘to be’, imperative (āśiṣi ‘benediction’) second-person singular as + siP 

 3.1.68 3.4.87 

3.1.68 kartari śap: affix ŚaP occurs after a verbal root when a sārvadhātuka affix which  denotes kartr̥ ‘agent’ follows. 

3.4.87 ser hy apic ca: same as above. 

There is no conflict between these rules.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.87 and get as + hi. Then, the  derivation proceeds as follows: as + hi 🡪 as + ŚaP + hi (3.1.68 kartari śap) 🡪 as + hi (2.4.72  adiprabhr̥tibhyaḥ śapaḥ). Since as is an aṅga with respect to hi, the following rules from the  aṅgādhikāra are applicable: 

a s + hi 

 6.4.111 6.4.119 7.1.35 6.4.101  6.4.111 śnasor allopaḥ: the a of affix ŚnaM and of root as, is replaced with LOPA when a  sārvadhātuka affix marked with K or Ṅ follows. 

6.4.119 ghvasor ed dhāv abhyāsalopaś ca: the final sound of a verbal base termed ghu or of  as, is replaced with e when affix hi follows, and abhyāsa (first of two reduplicated syllables) is replaced with LOPA. 

7.1.35 tuhyos tātaṅ āśiṣy anyatarasyām: affixes tu and hi are optionally replaced with tātAṄ,  provided benediction (āśiḥ) is denoted. 

6.4.101 hujhalbhyo her dhiḥ: hi is replaced with dhi when it occurs after root hu or after a  verbal base ending in jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative). 

There is no conflict between 6.4.111 and 6.4.119.  

There is an SOI between 7.1.35 and 6.4.101. 7.1.35 is more specific because it has been taught with respect to benedictive forms. 

So now let us look at the relationship between 6.4.119 and 7.1.35. If we apply 6.4.119 at this  step, then 7.1.35 will be applicable at the following step. If we replace hi with tātAṄ by 7.1.35 

148 

at this step, 6.4.119 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional  blocking, and thus of DOI conflict. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we perform the right-most operation 7.1.35 (which defeats  6.4.101 in SOI, as seen above) and get: as + tāt 🡪 stāt (6.4.111 śnasor allopaḥ), which is the  correct form.  

If we do not implement the optional rule 7.1.35, the derivation proceeds as follows: a s + hi 

 6.4.111 6.4.119 6.4.101  

There is no conflict between 6.4.111 and 6.4.119. Let us look at the relationship between  6.4.119 and 6.4.101.  

If we apply 6.4.119 at this step, then 6.4.101 will not be applicable at the following step. If we  apply 6.4.101 at this step, then 6.4.119 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a  case of mutual blocking.  

Note that all three rules belong to the asiddhavat section. So, each rule can see the other two rules but not the outcome of the application of the other two rules. Since these rules can see  one another, we can use 1.4.2 to solve the DOI between them. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right-most rule 6.4.101 and get as + dhi. The other  two rules cannot see the outcome of the application of 6.4.101. They are still applicable: 

 a s + dhi 

 6.4.111 6.4.119  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.119 and get ae + dhi. Here, 6.4.111  applies and we get the correct form edhi.

149 

26. bhū + ta – ‘to be’, passive aorist third-person singular 

bhū + ta 🡪 bhū + cli + ta (3.1.43 cli luṅi49)  

bhū + cli + ta 

 7.3.84 3.1.66  

7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ: guṇa replaces the final iK (i, u, ṛ, ḷ) of a verbal base when  a sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows. 

3.1.66 ciṇ bhāvakarmaṇoḥ: CiṆ occurs in place of affix cli after a verbal base when the LUṄ substitute ta denoting bhāva ‘action’ or karman ‘object’ follows. 

There is no conflict between these two rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS  rule 3.1.66 and get bhū + CiṆ + ta. Thereafter, the derivation proceeds as follows: bhū + CiṆ + ta 🡪 bhau + CiṆ + ta (7.2.115 aco ñṇiti50) 🡪 bhāv + CiṆ + ta (6.1.78 eco’yavāyāvaḥ).  Since bhāv and CiṆ cannot undergo any other operations which are not triggered by ta, we can  write bhāv + CiṆ as bhāvi. By my interpretation of 1.4.13, bhāvi is an aṅga with respect to ta. 

Here, multiple rules from the aṅgādhikāra become applicable: 

 bhāvi + ta 

 6.4.71 6.4.104 

6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ: the udātta ‘high-pitched’ augment aṬ is attached to a verbal  base when affixes LUṄ, LAṄ and LR̥Ṅ follow. 

6.4.104 ciṇo luk: an affix which occurs after CiṆ is replaced with LUK. 

Note that both these rules fall under the heading rule 6.4.22 asiddhavad atrābhāt. They are  asiddhavat with respect to each other. That is, each rule acknowledges the existence of the  other rule, but not the outcome of the application of the other rule. 

49 Affix cli is added to a verbal root when LUṄ follows. 

50 Note that, at this step, there is an SOI between 7.2.115 aco ñṇiti and 7.3.84  sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ. However, I have not drawn a diagram to show this in the main text for  the sake of brevity. Since 7.2.115 is conditioned by affixes marked with Ñ and Ṇ, it is more specific  and thus wins. 

150Since 6.4.71 and 6.4.104 acknowledge each other’s existence, we can use 1.4.2 to deal with  this case of DOI. 

If we apply 6.4.71 at this step, 6.4.104 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply  6.4.104 at this step, the affix will be replaced with LUK, and so 6.4.71 will not be applicable at  the following step51. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.104 and get: bhāvi. Since 6.4.104 is  asiddhavat with respect to 6.4.71, 6.4.71 does not acknowledge the outcome of the application  of 6.4.104. Consequently, 6.4.71 applies, and we get the correct form: abhāvi. 

27. krī + jhi – ‘to buy’, present third-person plural 

krī + jhi 🡪 krī + Śnā + jhi (3.1.81 kryādibhyaḥ śnā52) 🡪 krīnā + jhi. Now that krīnā is an  aṅga with respect to jhi, the following rules from the aṅgādhikāra become applicable: 

krīnā + jhi 

 6.4.112 6.4.113 7.1.3 

6.4.112 śnābhyastayor ātaḥ53: the final ā of a base which ends in Śnā or of a reduplicated base (abhyasta) is replaced with LOPA when a sārvadhātuka affix marked with K or Ṅ follows. 

6.4.113 ī haly aghoḥ: the final ā of a base which ends in Śnā or of a reduplicated base  (abhyasta), excluding items termed ghu, is replaced with ī when a sārvadhātuka affix  beginning with a consonant and marked with K or Ṅ follows. 

7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ: jh which is the initial sound of an affix is replaced with ant. 

There is an SOI between 6.4.112 and 6.4.113. First let us identify the more specific i.e., winning  rule. Then we will examine the DOI between the winning rule and 7.1.3.  

51 1.1.63 na lumatāṅgasya. 

52 Affix Śnā occurs after verbal roots belonging to the class headed by ḌUkrīÑ ‘to buy, barter’ when a  sārvadhātuka affix which denotes kartr̥ follows. 

53 6.4.112 and 6.4.113 are applicable here because jhi is treated as marked with K / Ṅ by virtue of being  an apit sārvadhātuka (cf. 1.2.4 sārvadhātukam apit).

151 

6.4.113 is more specific because it is applicable only when the affix begins with a consonant, and thus wins. Now let us look at the DOI relationship between 6.4.113 and 7.1.3. 

If we apply 6.4.113 at this step, 7.1.3 will be applicable at the following step. However, if we  apply 7.1.3 at this step, jhi will no longer begin with a consonant. Thus 6.4.113 will not be  applicable at the following step. 

This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.3 and get: krīnā+ anti. Here, 6.4.112  applies and we get krīṇanti54 which is the correct form.  

28. udvij + ta – ‘to fear’, simple future third-person singular 

 udvij + ta 

 3.1.33 3.4.79 

3.1.33 syatāsī lr̥luṭoḥ: affixes sya and tāsI respectively occur after verbal bases when LR̥ and  LUṬ follow. 

3.4.79 ṭita ātmanepadānāṁ ṭer e: the part that begins with the last vowel (ṭi)55 of an  ātmanepada replacement of a lakāra marked with Ṭ is replaced with e. 

There is no conflict between these rules.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.79 and get udvij + te. Thereafter we  apply 3.1.33 and get udvij + sya + te. Here two rules are applicable: 

 udvij + sya + te 

 7.3.86 7.2.35  

7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca: guṇa replaces the iK (i, u, r̥, l̥) of a verbal base which ends  in the augment pUK or which has a laghu ‘light’ vowel as its penultimate sound when a  sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows. 

54 8.4.2 aṭkupvāṅnumvyavāye’pi. 

55 1.1.64 aco’ntyādi ṭi.

152 

7.2.35 ārdhadhātukasyeḍ valādeḥ: augment iṬ is attached to an ārdhadhātuka affix beginning  with vaL (any consonant except y). 

If we apply 7.3.86 at this step, 7.2.35 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply  7.2.35 at this step, 7.3.86 will not be applicable at the following step, because of the following  rule: 

1.2.2 vija iṭ: an affix with initial augment iṬ is treated as if marked with Ṅ when it occurs after  OvijI ‘to fear’.  

So, if we apply 7.2.35 at this step, the resultant isya, by 1.2.2, will be treated as marked with  Ṅ. Consequently, thanks to 1.1.5 kṅiti ca, 7.3.86 will not be applicable at the following step. 

This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.2.35 and get: udvijisya + te 🡪 udvijiṣyate (8.3.59 ādeśapratyayoḥ), which is the correct form. 

29. bhī + jhi – ‘to be afraid’, present third-person plural 

bhī + jhi 🡪 bhī + ŚaP + jhi (3.1.68 kartari śap) 🡪 bhī + ŚLU + jhi (2.4.75 juhotyādibhyaḥ śluḥ) 🡪 bhībhī + ŚLU + jhi (6.1.10 ślau) 🡪 bhibhī + ŚLU + jhi (7.4.59 hrasvaḥ56). 

At this point, bhibhī and ŚLU cannot undergo any other operations which are not triggered by  jhi. Thus, we can write bhibhī + ŚLU as bhibhī. In bhibhī + jhi, bhibhī can now be called an  aṅga with respect to jhi. Thus, the following rules from the aṅgādhikāra become applicable: 

 bh i bh ī + jh i 

 6.4.115 7.1.3 7.1.4 

6.4.115 bhiyo’nyatarasyām: the final ī of bhī is optionally replaced with i when an affix  beginning with a consonant, and marked with K or Ṅ follows.57 

56 The vowel of the abhyāsa ‘first of two reduplicated syllables’ is replaced with its short counterpart. 57 By virtue of being an apit sārvadhātuka, jhi is treated as marked with K / Ṅ (cf. 1.2.4 sārvadhātukam  apit).

153 

7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ: a jh which is the initial sound of an affix is replaced with ant. 

7.1.4 ad abhyastāt: when preceded by a reduplicated base, a jh which is the initial sound of an  affix is replaced with at. 

There is an SOI relationship between 7.1.3 and 7.1.4. Since 7.1.4 has been taught specifically  for reduplicated bases, it is more specific and thus wins. 

Let us consider the relationship between 7.1.4 and 6.4.115. If we apply 6.4.115 at this step,  7.1.4 will be applicable at the following step. But if, by 7.1.4, we replace jh with at, which  starts with a vowel, 6.4.115 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of  unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.4 (which defeats 7.1.3 in SOI, as seen  above) and get: bhibhī + ati 🡪 bhibhy + ati (6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci). Now that all rules from the  sapādasaptādhyāyī have applied, we can apply 8.4.54 abhyāse car ca from the tripādī. This  gives us bibhyati, which is the correct form.  

Note that the optional rule 6.4.115 bhiyo’nyatarasyām, despite being applicable, does not  actually end up applying in this derivation. So even if we had not implemented the optional  rule 6.4.115, we would still have got the same form, i.e., bibhyati. 

30. ṇijIR + tiP – ‘to purify’, aorist third-person singular 

ṇijIR + tiP 

 6.1.65 3.1.43 3.4.100 

6.1.65 ṇo naḥ: the initial ṇ of a verbal root when taught in the Dhātupāṭha is replaced with n. 3.1.43 cli luṅi: affix cli is added to a verbal root when LUṄ follows. 

3.4.100 itaś ca: the i of a replacement of any lakāra marked with Ṅ, is replaced with LOPA. 

There is no conflict between these rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right most rule 3.4.100 and get: ṇijIR + t. Here the following rules are applicable:

154 

ṇijIR + t 

 6.1.65 3.1.43  

There is no conflict between these rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule  3.1.43 and get ṇij + cli + t. Here the following rules are applicable: 

 ṇ i jIR + cli + t 

 6.1.65 7.3.86 3.1.57 3.1.44 

6.1.65 ṇo naḥ: same as above. 

7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca: same as above. 

3.1.44 cleḥ sic: cli is replaced with sIC. 

3.1.57 irito vā: affix cli is optionally replaced with aṄ after verbal roots marked with IR when  a parasmaipada replacement of LUṄ which denotes kartr̥ follows.  

6.1.65 is not in conflict with the other rules. There is an SOI relationship between 3.1.44 and  3.1.57. Since 3.1.57 has been specifically taught for roots marked with IR, it wins. 

Let us consider the DOI relationship between 7.3.86 and 3.1.57. If we apply 7.3.86 at this step,  3.1.57 will be applicable at the following step. But if we replace cli with aṄ by 3.1.57, then by  1.1.5 kṅiti ca, 7.3.86 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional  blocking and thus of DOI conflict. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we perform the right most operation 3.1.57 (which defeats 3.1.44  in SOI, as seen above). We get: ṇij + aṄ + t 🡪 nij + aṄ + t (6.1.65). nij and aṄ cannot undergo  any other operations which are not triggered by t, so we can write nij + aṄ as nija. nija is an  aṅga with respect to t. Thus, we apply 6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ and get anijat, which is  the correct form. 

If we do not implement the optional rule 3.1.57 irito vā, the derivation proceeds as follows: ṇij  + cli + t 🡪 ṇij + sIC + t (3.1.44) 🡪 ṇaij + s + t (7.2.3 vadavrajahalantasyācaḥ) 🡪 naij + s 

155 

+ t (6.1.65 ṇo naḥ) 🡪 naijs + īt (7.3.96 astisico’pr̥kte) 🡪 anaikṣīt (6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ)58, which is also correct.  

31. sic + tiP – ‘to sprinkle’, aorist third-person singular 

This derivation is very similar to the previous one so I will simply focus on the part involving  DOI conflict. In the rest of the steps, if two rules are simultaneously applicable, I choose the  RHS rule in case of DOI and the more specific rule in case of SOI. 

sic + tip 🡪 sic + t (3.4.100 itaś ca) 🡪 sic + cli + t (3.1.43 cli luṅi) 

sic + cli + a 

 7.3.86 3.1.53 

7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca: same as above. 

3.1.53 lipisicihvaś ca: affix cli is replaced with aṄ after verbal roots lip ‘to coat, smear’, sic ‘to  pour out, sprinkle’ or hveÑ ‘to call’ when LUṄ which denotes kartr̥ follows. 

If we apply 7.3.86 at this step, 3.1.53 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply  3.1.53 at this step, then by 1.1.5 kṅiti ca, 7.3.86 will not be applicable at the following step.  This is a case of unidirectional blocking and thus of DOI conflict. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.1.53 and get sic + aṄ + t. sic and aṄ cannot undergo any other operations which are not triggered by t. Thus sic + aṄ can be written  as sica. Thereafter 6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ from the aṅgādhikāra applies, leading to the  correct form, asicat. 

58 In the interest of brevity, I have omitted to mention certain phonological processes here, which lead  us from naijs to naikṣ.

156 

32. vanU + Ktvā – ‘to desire’, absolutive 

v a n + Ktvā 

 6.4.15 6.4.37 7.2.56  

6.4.15 anunāsikasya kvijhaloḥ kṅiti: the penultimate vowel of a base which ends in a nasal  (anunāsika), is replaced with its long counterpart when affix KvI, or an affix beginning with  jhaL ‘a non-nasal stop or a fricative’ and marked with K or Ṅ follows. 

6.4.37 anudāttopadeśavanatitanotyādīnām anunāsikalopo jhali kṅiti: the final nasal of a base  marked with anudātta when taught in the Dhātupāṭha, as well as of vanA ‘to like’ and the roots  headed by tanU ‘to extend’, is replaced with LOPA when an affix beginning with jhaL ‘a non nasal stop or a fricative’ and marked with K or Ṅ follows. 

7.2.56 udito vā: augment iṬ is optionally attached to affix Ktvā when it follows a verbal root  marked with U. 

Let us consider the relationship of 7.2.56 with the other two rules. If we apply 6.4.15 or 6.4.37  at this step, 7.2.56 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply 7.2.56 at this step,  then then both 6.4.14 and 6.4.37 will not be applicable at the following step. Thus, 7.2.56  unidirectionally blocks both 6.4.15 and 6.4.37 and is in a DOI conflict with both of them. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right most rule 7.2.56 and get vanitvā, which is the  correct form. 

If we do not implement the optional rule 7.2.56, the derivation proceeds as follows: v a n + Ktvā 

 6.4.15 6.4.37  

If we apply 6.4.15 at this step, 6.4.37 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply  6.4.37 at this step, 6.4.15 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of  unidirectional blocking and of DOI conflict.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.37 and get vatvā, which is also correct.

157 

33. āhan + iṬ – ‘to hit’, optative first-person singular 

āhan + iṬ 

 3.1.68 3.4.106 3.4.102 3.1.68 kartari śap: affix ŚaP occurs after a verbal root when a sārvadhātuka affix which  denotes kartr̥ ‘agent’ follows. 

3.4.102 liṅas sīyuṭ: a substitute of LIṄ receives the augment sīyUṬ. 

3.4.106 iṭo’t: iṬ, which is the first-person singular ātmanepada substitute of LIṄ, is replaced  with aT. 

3.1.68 neither blocks nor is blocked by the other rules. There is an SOI relationship between  3.4.106 and 3.4.102, and 3.4.106 wins because it has been specifically taught for iṬ.  

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.106 (which defeats 3.4.102 in SOI,  as stated above) and get āhan + aT. Here two rules are applicable: 

āhan + aT 

 3.1.68 3.4.102 

As stated before, there is no conflict between these two rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2,  we apply the RHS rule 3.4.102 and get āhan + sīya. Thereafter the derivation proceeds as  follows: āhan + sīya 🡪 āhan + ŚaP + sīya (3.1.68 kartari śap) 🡪 āhan + sīya (2.4.72  adiprabhr̥tibhyaḥ śapaḥ). Now āhan can be called an aṅga with respect to sīya. Thus, the  following rules from the aṅgādhikāra are applicable: 

āha n + s īya 

 6.4.37 7.2.79 

6.4.37 anudāttopadeśavanatitanotyādīnām anunāsikalopo jhali kṅiti: same as above. 

7.2.79 liṅaḥ salopo’nantyasya: the non-final s of a sārvadhātuka substitute of LIṄ is replaced  with LOPA. 

If we apply 6.4.37 at this step, 7.2.79 will still be applicable at the following step. But if we  apply 7.2.79 at this step, āhan will no longer be followed by a jhaL sound and thus 6.4.37 will 

158 

not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of  DOI conflict. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.2.79 and get āhan + īya. Thereafter,  the derivation proceeds as follows: āhn + īya (6.4.98 gamahanajanakhanaghasāṁ lopaḥ kṅity  anaṅi59) 🡪 āghnīya (7.3.54 ho hanter ñṇinneṣu60), which is the correct form. 

34. vyadh + Ktvā – ‘to hurt’, absolutive 

v y adh + Ktvā 

 6.1.16 6.1.16  

6.1.16 grahijyāvayivyadhivaṣṭivicativr̥ścatipr̥cchatibhr̥jjatīnāṁ ṅiti ca: verbal roots grahA ‘to  grab, seize’, jyā ‘to decay, grow old’, vay (a substitute of veÑ ‘to weave’ by 2.4.41 veño vayiḥ),  vyadhA ‘to pierce, hurt’, vaśA ‘to shine’, vyacA ‘to deceive’, OvraścŪ ‘to cut’, pracchA ‘to  ask’ and bhrasjA ‘to roast’ undergo samprasāraṇa when an affix marked with K and Ṅ follows. 

Note that both v and y can potentially undergo samprasāraṇa by 6.1.16. If we apply 6.1.16 to  v at this step, 6.1.16 will be applicable to y at the following step. But if we apply 6.1.16 to y at  this step, then by 6.1.37 na samprasāraṇe samprasāraṇam, 6.1.16 will not be applicable to v at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking and thus of DOI conflict. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.1.16 to y and get viadh + tvā.  Thereafter, the derivation proceeds as follows: vidh + tvā (6.1.108 samprasāraṇāc ca) 🡪 vidhdhvā (8.2.40 jhaṣas tathor dho’dhaḥ) 🡪 viddhvā (8.4.53 jhalāṁ jaś jhaśi), which is the  correct form.

### 4.4 Examples of SOI  

We have already looked at several examples of SOI while discussing examples of DOI conflict. Here I will present a few more examples. As I have done earlier, I will spell out and examine the conditions in which the rules apply and then determine which of the two rules is more  specific. 

(1) cal + tiP – ‘to walk’, simple future third-person singular  

cal + tiP 

 3.1.33 3.1.68 

3.1.33 syatāsī lr̥luṭoḥ: affixes sya and tāsI respectively occur after verbal roots when LR̥ and  LUṬ follow. 

3.1.68 kartari śap: affix ŚaP occurs after a verbal root when a sārvadhātuka affix which  denotes kartr̥ ‘agent’ follows. 

3.1.33 

(when LR̥ and LUṬ follow) 

3.1.68 

(when LR̥ and LUṬ follow) 

(when other sārvadhātuka affixes follow) 

The conditions highlighted in bold are exactly the same. This is a case of SOI-M. Thus, we  compare the two rules themselves. 3.1.33 has been taught specifically for LR̥ and LUṬ. So, it  is more specific and thus wins. We get cal + sya + ti 🡪 caliṣyati (7.2.35 ārdhadhātukasyeḍ valādeḥ), which is the correct form. 

160(2) vad + miP – ‘to speak’, imperative first-person singular 

vad + miP 

 3.1.68 3.4.89 3.4.92 3.1.68 kartari śap: same as above. 

3.4.89 mer niḥ: a miP substitute of LOṬ is replaced with ni. 

3.4.92 āḍ uttamasya pic ca: a first-person substitute of LOṬ receives the initial augment āṬ which is treated as marked with P. 

3.1.68 is not in conflict with 3.4.89 or 3.4.92. By my interpretation of 1.4.2 we should perform  the RHS operation. But which one of the two RHS rules, namely 3.4.89 and 3.4.92, should we  apply? Let us examine the SOI between 3.4.89 and 3.4.92. 

3.4.89 

miP (replacement of LOṬ) 

3.4.92  

miP (replacement of LOṬ) 

other first-person affixes (replacements of LOṬ) 

The conditions highlighted in bold are exactly the same. This is a case of SOI-M. Thus, we  compare the two rules themselves. 3.4.89 has been taught specifically for miP. So, it is more  specific and thus wins. Thus, we get vad + ni. Thereafter, the derivation proceeds as follows:  vad + ni 🡪 vad + āni (3.4.92 āḍ uttamasya pic ca) 🡪 vad + ŚaP + āni (3.1.68 kartari śap) 🡪 

vadāni (6.1.97 ato guṇe), which is the correct form. 

161 

(3) tṝ + tiP – ‘to cross’, present third-person singular 

tṝ + tiP 🡪 tṝ + ŚaP + tiP (3.1.68 kartari śap) 

 tṝ + ŚaP + tiP 

 7.3.84 7.1.100 

7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ: guṇa replaces the final sound iK (i, u, r̥, l̥) of a verbal  base when a sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows. 

7.1.100 ṝta id dhātoḥ: ṝ which occurs at the end of a verbal base is replaced with i. 

Note that, we have to take into account rules like 1.1.5 kṅiti ca [which prohibits guṇa and  vr̥ddhi of the iK (i, u, r̥, l̥) of a verbal base when the following affix is marked with K, G or Ṅ] when determining the exact conditions in which the aforementioned rules are applicable.  Because of 1.1.5, 7.3.84 is applicable only when the affix is not marked with K, G or Ṅ. 

7.3.84 

ṝ + affix (sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka) (not marked with K, G, Ṅ) other iK sounds + affix (sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka) (not marked with K, G, Ṅ) 7.1.100 

ṝ + affix (sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka)  

The conditions highlighted in bold are not the same. Thus, this is a case of SOI-L. 7.3.84 is  more specific because it is applicable only if the affix is not marked with K, G or Ṅ whereas  7.1.100 is applicable regardless of whether the affix is marked with K, G or Ṅ. Thus, 7.3.84  wins, giving the correct form tarati (cf. 1.1.51 ur aṇ raparaḥ). 

Let us now consider Cardona’s (1970: 57-58) method of deriving this form. He uses a principle  that he calls ‘limited blocking’ to deal with this aforementioned SOI. He explains it as follows: “though a rule R2 as a whole does not state an apavāda of an R1, as a whole, it can do so for  some operands or environments common to both”. Further, he says: “(Consider) rules: 7.3.84  sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ and 7.1.100 ṝta id dhātoḥ. By the latter, the ṝ of an aṅga which is a verb root is replaced with i. The rules are not related as utsarga and apavāda in their  entirety: the operands of 7.3.84 are i, u, r̥ while that of 7.1.100 is ṝ. Nor are the contexts  identical. Although 7.1.100 operates when the root is followed by any affix introduced after it 

162 

and sārvadhātuka and ārdhadhātuka affixes, the contexts for 7.3.84, include all post-radical  affixes, the context of 7.3.84 is restricted by 1.1.5 (kṅiti ca). In the case of the single shared  operand (ṝ), then, 7.1.100 will counter 7.3.84 (sic)61, since all the contexts of the former are  included in those of the latter. Thus, given the root stṝ followed by the affix ana, one obtains  the desired form staraṇa- ‘spreading’ without recourse to paratva.” 

Kiparsky (1991: 350-351) criticizes this solution, saying that using such arguments, one could  have arrived at exactly the opposite conclusion. He says, “So (Cardona’s statement) is  compatible with two different procedures yielding opposite results:  

“If the environments of R2 are properly included in the environments of R1, and the operands  of R1, are properly included in the operands of R2, then  

a. R2 blocks R1, (for the environments of R2 are properly included in the environments of R1,  in the shared operand domain).  

b. R1 blocks R2 (for the operands of R1 are properly included in the operands of R2 in the shared  environment domain).  

“In case (a) of Cardona 1970 (p. 57) the two rules are: 7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ (guṇaḥ) and 7.1.100 ṝta id dhātoḥ. So, Cardona applies procedure a: “in the case of the single  shared operand (ṝ) then, 7.1.100 will counter 7.3.84 [sic – this is evidently a slip and he must  have meant to say ‘7.3.84 will counter 7.1.100’], since all the contexts of the former are  included in those of the later”. If the facts were the other way round (i.e., if the outcome was  *stiraṇa), he would have said “in the case of the single shared context (non-kit suffixes),  7.1.100 will counter 7.3.84, since all the operands of the former are included in those of the  latter (procedure b)”. 

I think that Cardona’s limited blocking principle is similar to my method of dealing with SOI.  However, Kiparsky correctly points out that the explanation offered by Cardona is ambiguous.  On the other hand, my solution overcomes such ambiguity by following the clearly defined  procedure which I have developed and used to tackle all examples of SOI in this thesis. 

This brings us to the end of our survey of SOI and DOI examples from derivations of finite  verbs and primary derivatives.  

61 As pointed out by Kiparsky, Cardona means the exact opposite, that is, ‘7.3.84 will counter 7.1.100’.

163 

### 4.5 Selection of Examples 

I have presented examples of both SOI conflict and DOI conflict in chapters 2, 3 and 4, of this  thesis. Instead of focusing on only those steps that involve conflict, I have performed entire  derivations, right from the first step to the last one – drawing diagrams for each step where two  or more rules are simultaneously applicable. Before closing this chapter, I must discuss the  process through which I conducted my searches for examples, the rationale behind the choice  of these examples and also the distributional patterns I noticed in this process. 

I performed numerous derivations from the Laghusiddhāntakaumudī and chose those which  involve examples of conflict. Having studied the various prakaraṇas ‘chapters’ of this text, namely those on sandhi, subanta, taddhitānta, samāsa, tiṅanta and kr̥danta, I have selected a diverse and representative set of examples to the best of my abilities. In order to avoid  redundancy, I have excluded those examples which are only superficially different from those included in this thesis. 

To show that my method can tackle all kinds of conflicts in various derivational contexts, I  have tried to strike a balance: 

(i) between short derivations which involve only two or three steps and fewer cases of same step interaction, and long ones which involve many steps and several cases of same step  interaction; 

(ii) between simple examples which help the reader gain conceptual clarity and complex ones  which demonstrate the potency of my solution; and 

(iii) between examples which have been extensively discussed in traditional literature and  examples which I have newly spotted during my research. 

To underscore the far-reaching impact of my research: 

(i) I have given precedence to derivations which involve popular, broad, general and widely applicable rules, whilst also ensuring the inclusion of derivations which involve rarely  applicable and highly specific rules.  

(ii) I have prioritized the exposition of those examples which highlight the contrast between  my method and the traditional method. 

(iii) I have paid special attention to certain challenging examples discussed in the Mahābhāṣya,  the Kāśikā, Cardona (1970), Kiparsky (1982), Pataskar (1985), Bronkhorst (2004), Joshi and 

164 

Kiparsky (2005) etc., with the aim of showing that my method is singlehandedly able to  overcome a wide variety of problems associated with this topic. In Appendix D, I provide more  information on the examples which are present in some of these sources and have also been  discussed by me.  

### 4.6 Distribution of Examples of Conflict 

Now let us examine the distribution of examples of conflict across various kinds of derivations  (e.g., subanta, kr̥danta etc.). Since Pāṇini uses the general-exception framework throughout  the Aṣṭādhyāyī, we find cases of SOI conflict in all kinds of derivations. And while we might  find more examples of SOI conflict in some kinds of derivations than others, we do not come  across any unique or peculiar patterns that merit discussion here. 

So, I will focus on the distribution of DOI conflicts in Pāṇinian derivations in this section. Let  us inquire why, on the whole, DOI conflicts, and especially certain kinds of DOI conflicts (e.g.,  mutual blocking), are found more frequently in certain kinds of derivations than others. I  request the reader to bear in mind that I will be making some broad generalizations here in  order to paint an overarching picture. Therefore, my statements will not be entirely accurate. 

Since we are talking about DOI-conflict here, I will not touch upon those instances of DOI  which do not involve conflict.  

To start with, let us consider subanta derivations. 

‘nominal base + declensional affix’ 

 A B 

We will focus on cases where the application of A to the base is triggered by the first sound of  the affix, and the application of B to the affix is triggered by the last sound of the base. If the  first sound of the affix changes, A is not applicable to the base anymore and if the last sound  of the base changes, B is not applicable to the affix anymore. Therefore, when two such rules  are simultaneously applicable in subanta derivations, A to the base and B to the affix, both  rules block each other, leading to a situation of DOI conflict. See examples 1-5 and 9 of section  2.7, chapter 2.  

In other cases, we find that the application of B to the affix is triggered simply by the  grammatical gender, word category (e.g., pronoun) etc. of the base. In such a case, even if the 

165 

base undergoes phonological change, B will still be applicable at the following step. On the  contrary, we observe that the application of A to the base is triggered by the first sound or the  mere presence of an affix. So, if the affix is deleted, for example, by LUK, or if its first sound  changes, then A will no longer be applicable at the following step. These are cases of unidirectional blocking. See examples 6-8 and 13 of section 2.7, chapter 2. 

Thus, we see both kinds of examples of DOI conflict, namely those of mutual blocking and  those of unidirectional blocking, in subanta derivations. Note that I have overlooked, for the  sake of simplicity, examples of DOI conflict where both rules apply to two different parts of  the base or to two different parts of the affix respectively. 

Let us contrast this with tiṅanta derivations. One of the early steps of these derivations looks  like this: 

‘verbal base + vikaraṇa + finite ending’ 

 C D E 

Vikaraṇas on the whole do not undergo many changes. Even when they do, the application of  D (which may teach replacement with LUK or other substitutes, augmentation, etc.) is not  triggered by the last sound of the verbal root. So even if the verbal root undergoes some  changes, D will still be applicable to the vikaraṇa at the following step. On the other hand, the  application of C (which may entail guṇa, samprasāraṇa, augmentation, lengthening of the  penultimate vowel, deletion of nasal etc.) is dependent on the existence of the vikaraṇa, its  being marked with K or Ṅ, etc. So, if the vikaraṇa undergoes certain changes, such as  replacement with LUK or attachment of certain augments like iṬ which annul the effect of K/Ṅ (cf. 1.2.18 na ktvā seṭ), C will not be applicable to the base at the following step. These are  cases of unidirectional blocking.  

Most rules (E) which are applicable to finite endings at this stage, are triggered by the type of  lakāra that the ending has replaced, whether that lakāra is marked with Ṭ or Ṅ, the number and  person of the ending, whether the ending is parasmaipada or ātmanepada etc. They do not  block and are not blocked by other rules (for example, see rules 3.4.77 – 3.4.112 of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī). So, we will not focus on them here.

166 

Once the aṅga is ready, we get: 

aṅga + finite ending 

 F G 

The application of F (such as guṇa, vr̥ddhi, samprasāraṇa etc.) is triggered by the existence of  the affix, the first sound of the affix, whether or not it is marked with K / Ṅ etc. Thus, if the  affix undergoes certain changes, F is not applicable at the following step. But G is not triggered  by the last sound of the aṅga. Thus, even if the aṅga undergoes certain changes, G is still  applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking.  

Let us now look at kr̥danta derivations. 

 verbal base + kr̥t affix  

 H I 

The application of H (such as guṇa, samprasāraṇa etc.) is triggered by / depends on the first  sound of the affix, whether it has taken the augment iṬ, whether it is marked with K / Ṅ etc.  Thus, if the affix undergoes certain changes, H is not applicable at the following step. Let us  call H the dependent rule. On the other hand, I is triggered by the first sound of the affix itself  (e.g., 7.2.35 ārdhadhātukasyeḍ valādeḥ) and other factors. Essentially, the application of I is  not dependent on the final sound of the base. So even if the base changes, I is still applicable  at the following step. Let us call I the independent rule. This is a case of unidirectional blocking,  where the independent rule blocks the dependent rule.  

Before we proceed further, notice that, in almost all cases of unidirectional blocking in DOI discussed in the thesis, it is the RHS rule which unidirectionally blocks the LHS rule, and not  vice-versa.62 This is because, it is the RHS rule which is independent and it is the LHS rule  which is dependent. In other words, in almost all cases of unidirectional blocking, the  applicability of the RHS rule does not depend on whether the penultimate or last sound of the  

62 This is exactly why the traditional nitya tool which teaches that the nitya rule defeats the anitya rule,  always correctly resolves cases of DOI conflict involving unidirectional blocking: the nitya rule is  applicable to the RHS operand and the anitya rule to the LHS operand. By (my interpretation of) 1.4.2,  the RHS rule (which is also the nitya rule) defeats the LHS rule (which is the anitya rule).

167 

base changes, but the applicability of the LHS rule does depend on whether the affix is marked  with K / Ṅ, whether it starts with a vowel, whether it has taken the augment iṬ etc. 

Coming back to the larger theme of this section, we see that almost all cases of DOI conflict in  both tiṅanta and kr̥danta derivations involve only unidirectional blocking. This can be  observed in the examples discussed in section 4.3. We rarely come across examples of DOI  conflict that involve mutual blocking. One such exception is example 21 of section 4.3 of this  chapter, which does involve mutual blocking.  

To sum up my observations, we find examples of both mutual and unidirectional blocking in  subanta derivations, but of unidirectional blocking alone in tiṅanta and kr̥danta derivations.  

As seen in this thesis, we find relatively fewer examples of DOI conflict in taddhitānta and  samāsa derivations than we do in subanta, tiṅanta and kr̥danta sections. How can we explain  this phenomenon?  

Let us first answer this question in the context of samāsa derivations. The samāsa template is  ‘[(base1 suP1) (base2 suP2)] + suP3’. suP1 and suP2 are replaced with LUK by 2.4.71 supo  dhātuprātipadikayoḥ. Thus, we are left with ‘base1 base2 + suP3’. Given that the only remaining  affix, i.e., suP3 is also a suP affix, there is almost no scope for any other conflicts to arise apart  from those that can potentially arise in subanta derivations. The only exceptions to this are  those cases wherein the uttarapada can potentially trigger changes in the pūrvapada (see  examples 1 and 8 of section 3.2, chapter 3). This explains why we find very few examples of  DOI conflict which are exclusive to samāsa derivations, i.e., which are not already found in  subanta derivations. 

In taddhitānta derivations too, we find very few examples DOI conflict. Even these examples  are quite similar to each other (see examples 3-7 of section 3.2, chapter 3) and arise because of  the nominal inflection of taddhitānta forms. Why is this the case? The majority of taddhita rules actually teach addition of taddhita affixes, and not any substitutions or modifications. The  taddhita template is ‘(nominal base + suP) + taddhita affix’. suP is replaced with LUK by 2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ. Thus, we are left with ‘nominal base + taddhita affix’. 

nominal base + taddhita affix 

 J L

168 

Taddhita affixes undergo very few, generic changes by rules (L) like by 7.1.2 āyaneyīnīyiyaḥ phaḍhakhacchaghāṁ pratyayādīnām, which are independent of the final sound of the nominal  base. So, any change in the base by rule J cannot block these operations (L) on taddhita affixes.  

The nominal bases preceding taddhita affixes can also undergo certain general changes by rules  (J) such as 7.2.117 taddhiteṣv acām ādeḥ, 7.2.118 kiti ca etc. which do not depend on the first  sound of the taddhita affix for their application, and thus are not blocked by L in case of DOI.  And even those operations (J) such as 6.4.146 or guṇaḥ and 6.4.148 yasyeti ca, which are  triggered by the first sound of the following taddhita affix, are seldom blocked, simply because  the following taddhita affixes themselves undergo very few changes. So, barring replacement  with LUK (see examples 3-7 of section 3.2, chapter 3), most changes in the taddhita affix  cannot block these operations (J) on the nominal base. Since there is little scope for DOI  blocking between J and L, we come across very few examples of DOI conflict in taddhita derivations.

Chapter Five 

### 5.1 Traditional Views on Asiddha and Asiddhavat 

In the previous chapters, I have shed light on how I think Pāṇini perceives the interactions between simultaneously applicable rules and more specifically, how he resolves cases of SOI  and DOI. In this process, I have also discussed my interpretation of 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam.  

In this chapter, I will dwell on three very important rules of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, which deal with  the concepts of asiddha and asiddhavat. 6.1.86 ṣatvatukor asiddhaḥ and 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham teach the former and 6.4.22 asiddhavad atrā bhāt the latter. I will discuss both the traditional  interpretation of these rules and my own interpretation of them. I will also demonstrate how  these rules impact SOI and DOI, if at all they do, and how they interact with (my interpretation  of) 1.4.2. 

Let me start by presenting the English translation of these three rules as per the traditional  interpretations. To highlight the differences of opinion within the tradition, I will make relevant  comments on what texts like Mahābhāṣya, Kāśikā, Siddhāntakaumudī and Nyāsa say about  these rules. 

6.1.86 ṣatvatukor asiddhaḥ (ekaḥ pūrvaparayoḥ saṁhitāyām): a single replacement (ekaḥ) in  place of the preceding and the following sound segments (pūrvaparayoḥ) in continuous  utterance (saṁhitāyām) is suspended1 (asiddhaḥ) with respect to any potential replacement  with ṣ or insertion of augment tUK (ṣatva-tuk-or). 

Here, should the kārya (i.e., ‘operation’, or more aptly, ‘outcome of application of the rule’) be suspended or the śāstra (i.e., the rule) itself? In traditional literature, if the kārya is suspended,  this is called kāryāsiddhi, whereas if the śāstra is suspended, this is called śāstrāsiddhi.  According to the Kāśikā, asiddha implies kāryāsiddhi2, but according to the  Siddhāntakaumudī, asiddha stands for śāstrāsiddhi3.4 

1 When A is suspended with respect to B, B cannot acknowledge A. 

2 ṣatve tuki ca kartavye ekādeśo’siddho bhavati, siddhakāryaṁ na karoti ity arthaḥ. 3 ṣatve tuki ca kartavye ekādeśaśāstram asiddhaṁ syāt. 

4 In his commentary on 8.2.1, Rama Nath Sharma (2003, Vol. 6, p. 476) says, “The asiddhatva of 8.2.1  pūrvatrāsiddham is thus accepted as suspension of rules (sāstrāsiddhatva). Neo-grammarians such as 

1708.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham: that which is taught from here onwards is suspended (asiddham) with  respect to what precedes it (pūrvatra).  

As per the tradition’s interpretation, 8.2.1 can be rewritten as follows: 

Q is suspended with respect to P if: 

(i) Q is taught after P in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, and 

(ii) Q is taught after 8.2.1 in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. 

Here, again, the Kāśikā favours the kāryāsiddhi interpretation, whereas the Siddhāntakaumudī prefers the śāstrāsiddhi interpretation. There is some discussion in Nyāsa on 8.2.1 about  whether asiddha stands for kāryāsiddhi or for śāstrāsiddhi. 

6.4.22 asiddhavad atrā bhāt: that which is taught in the section starting here and extending up  to bh (ā bhāt)5 is suspended (asiddhavat)6, if both rules have a samānāśraya ‘common  substratum’ (atra). 

According to the Kāśikā on 6.4.22, we must infer samānāśrayatva from the presence of word  atra.7 The Nyāsa glosses āśraya as nimitta ‘cause’. If this is the case, samānāśraya would  mean ‘common cause’. However, I do not think this is the correct interpretation. I will explain  my understanding of the meaning of samānāśraya later in this chapter, when discussing a  germane example.  

On 6.4.22, Kātyāyana presents two different views on the meaning of the word atra. One view  is that it stands for samānāśrayatva8. The other opinion is that atra has been used to indicate  

Nāgeśa and Bhaṭṭojī Dīkṣita accept this view. Earlier grammarians, which also includes authors of the  Kāśikāvr̥tti, accept the kāryāsiddhatva view.” 

5 There is some controversy about the meaning of ā bhāt. We will examine this topic later in this chapter. 6 Kāśikā’s interpretation alludes to the rules which are asiddhavat, but does not mention the rules with  respect to which these rules are asiddhavat. We are left to answer the ‘with respect to what?’ question  on our own. 

7 atreti samānāśrayatvapratipattyartham. 

8 Explaining why asiddhavat is not applicable in a certain context, Kātyāyana says (vt. 12)  samānāśrayavacanāt siddham ‘[despite being placed in the section headed by 6.4.22] it (i.e., this rule)  is siddha [and not asiddhavat] because [asiddhavat has been taught only in regard with]  samānāśrayatva, [and here the samānāśrayatva condition has not been met]’ (Mbh III.190.22).

171 

that it is with respect to the rules taught atra ‘here’ (in the section headed by 6.4.22) that the  rules of this section (i.e., those rules headed by 6.4.22) are asiddhavat.9 In other words, if atra had not been mentioned, the rules taught in this section would have become asiddhavat even  with respect to rules lying outside this section, such as 7.2.116 ata upadhāyāḥ10, which is not  desirable11, hence the need to state ‘atra’. We can say that atra, according to this view, stands  for ‘with respect to the rules taught here (i.e., in the section headed by 6.4.22)’. 

Both the Kāśikā and the Siddhāntakaumudī interpret ā bhāt, not as ‘up to 6.4.129 bhasya’, but  instead as ‘up to the end of the section headed by 6.4.129 bhasya’. The jurisdiction of 6.4.129  continues up to 6.4.175, which is the end of 6.4. Thus, according to the Kāśikā, ā bhāt implies ‘up to the end of 6.4’.12 On the other hand, Kātyāyana and Patañjali discuss both possibilities13:  one, that the jurisdiction of 6.4.22 ends at 6.4.129, and the other, that it continues up to the end  of 6.4. We will study this later in this chapter. 

From what both the Kāśikā and the Siddhāntakaumudī say about 6.4.22, the traditional  interpretation of this rule can be rewritten as follows: 

A is suspended with respect to B if: 

(i) both A and B are taught in 6.4.22 – 6.4.175, and 

(ii) both A and B have a samānāśraya 

Note that the tradition does not make any actual distinction between asiddha and asiddhavat,  which is why I have translated both terms as ‘suspended’. 

9 See Vt. 2 atragrahaṇam viṣayārtham (Mbh III.187.11) and Patañjali’s commentary on it. 10 For example, consider the form rāga ‘colour’ which is derived from the root rañjI ‘to colour’. The  derivation proceeds as follows: rañj + GHaÑ (3.3.18 bhāve) 🡪 raj + a (6.4.27 ghañi ca  bhāvakaraṇayoḥ) 🡪 rāj + a (7.2.116 ata upadhāyāḥ) 🡪 rāga (7.3.52 cajoḥ ku ghiṇṇyatoḥ). Here, if  6.4.27 is asiddhavat with respect to 7.2.116, then 7.2.116 will not apply after the application of 6.4.27. 11 On vt. 2, Patañjali says: viṣayaḥ pratinirdiśyate. atraitasminn ābhāc chāstra ā bhāc chāstram  asiddhaṁ yathā syāt. iha mā bhūt. abhāji rāgaḥ upabarhaṇam iti.  

12 yad ita ūrdhvam anukramiṣyāmaḥ ā adhyāyaparisamāpteḥ tad asiddhavat bhavati ity evaṁ veditavyam (Kāśikā on 6.4.22). 

13 Mbh III.192.10-193.19.

### 5.2 My Interpretation of These Three Rules 

In this section, I will present my interpretation of the three rules and support the same with  evidence and examples. I will also show how SOI and DOI function in these sections.  

Let us first examine 6.1.86 ṣatvatukor asiddhaḥ and 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham respectively. I  think that asiddha in these two rules denotes śāstrāsiddhi: rule X is asiddha with respect to  rule Y. However, when rule X (śāstra) is asiddha with respect to rule Y, the outcome of the  application of rule X (kārya) too will automatically be asiddha with respect to rule Y. In other  words, I think that śāstrāsiddhi always entails kāryāsiddhi. Thus, we conclude that 6.1.86 and  8.2.1 teach śāstrāsiddhi, and therefore, also teach kāryāsiddhi.14 

What impact does the fact that one rule is asiddha with respect to the other rule have on 1.4.2?  We cannot use 1.4.2 to resolve a case of DOI unless both rules involved in the DOI  acknowledge each other’s existence. How do we resolve cases of DOI where one rule does not  acknowledge the existence of the other? In such cases of DOI, the rule which does not  acknowledge the existence of the other rule prevails. This will become clearer through the  examples discussed later in this chapter.  

Consider the following examples: 

1) adhī + Ktvā – ‘to study’, absolutive 

Note that adhī is formed by applying rule 6.1.101 akaḥ savarṇe dīrghaḥ (which teaches that a  long vowel replaces both aK ‘a, i, u, r̥ or l̥’ and the immediately following savarṇa ‘homogeneous’ vowel) to adhi + i. I have explained why we need to begin the derivation with  adhī + Ktvā when discussing example 5 of section 4.3, chapter 4. 

To adhī + Ktvā, we apply the rule 7.1.37 samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap which teaches that, in a  compound, the first member of which is not naÑ, the affix Ktvā in the second part of the  compound is replaced with LyaP. Thus, we get adhīya. 6.1.86 teaches that a rule prescribing a  single replacement in place of the preceding and the following sound segments is asiddha with  respect to rules teaching replacement with ṣ or attachment of augment tUK. Thus, we deem 

both 6.1.101 akaḥ savarṇe dīrghaḥ and the outcome of its application (because, remember,  

14 The Nyāsa on 8.2.1 too says so: śāstrasyāsiddhau ca kr̥tāyām arthataḥ kāryāsiddhatvaṁ kr̥tam eva  bhavati tasya tannibandhanatvāt. 

173 

śāstrāsiddhi always entails kāryāsiddhi) to be suspended with respect to the rule 6.1.71  hrasvasya piti kr̥ti tuk, which teaches that augment tUK is attached to a verbal base ending in  a short vowel when a kr̥t affix marked with P follows. Therefore, we consider adhīya to be adhi-i-ya, apply 6.1.71 to it, and get the correct form adhītya. 

If Pāṇini had not taught 6.1.86, 6.1.71 would not have applied here, leading to the incorrect  form *adhīya.15 

2) kas + asiñcat ‘Who sprinkled?’ 

The derivation proceeds as follows: kas + asiñcat 🡪 kar + asiñcat (8.2.66 sasajuṣoḥ ruḥ16)  🡪 ka-u + asiñcat (6.1.113 ato ror aplutād aplute17) 🡪 ko asiñcat (6.1.87 ād guṇaḥ) 🡪 ko’siñcat (6.1.109 eṅaḥ padāntād ati), which is the correct phrase. 

We have derived ko’siñcat by applying 6.1.109 eṅaḥ padāntād ati which teaches pūrvarūpa  ekādeśa, i.e., the replacement of o + a in ko + asiñcat with the LHS sound o. By 6.1.86  ṣatvatukor asiddhaḥ, 6.1.109 and the outcome of its application (o) are asiddha with respect to  the following rule teaching ṣatva: 

8.3.59 ādeśapratyayoḥ: ṣ replaces non-pada-final s of a substitute or of an affix occurring after  iṆ (any vowel except a; h, y, v, r and l) or a velar stop, even when there is intervention of nUM,  visarjanīya, or śaR (ś, ṣ, s). 

15 Note that, if we had started the derivation with adhi + itvā, the derivation would have proceeded as  follows. Two rules are applicable here, namely 6.1.101 akaḥ savarṇe dīrghaḥ and 7.1.37  samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap. This is a case of DOI. By 1.4.2, the RHS rule wins and we get adhi + iya.  Here, two rules are applicable: 6.1.101 and 6.1.71 hrasvasya piti kr̥ti tuk. This is a case of SOI. 6.1.71  is more specific and thus wins. This gives us adhi + itya. Now 6.1.101 applies, giving the correct form  adhītya. Notice that, if we start the derivation with adhi + itvā, we get the correct form without applying  6.1.86. But the fact that Pāṇini composed 6.1.86 confirms the fact that the derivation of this compound  begins with adhī + tvā and not with adhi + itvā, even though the compound itself is being formed from  adhi and itvā by 2.2.18 kugatiprādayaḥ. I have discussed this in some detail in example 5 of section  4.3, chapter 4. 

16 The s at the end of a pada and the final s of sajus ‘companion, together with’ are replaced with rU. 17 An uT replaces a rU when it is both preceded and followed by a non-pluta a.

174 

Thus 8.3.59 is not able to apply to ko’siñcat. If Pāṇini had not composed 6.1.86, then 8.3.59  would have applied to ko’siñcat, giving us the incorrect form: *ko’ṣiñcat. 

However, there is a problematic aspect of this derivation that merits discussion: we know that  8.2.66 sasajuṣoḥ ruḥ is asiddha with respect to 6.1.113 ato ror aplutād aplute by 8.2.1  pūrvatrāsiddham. Therefore, 6.1.113 cannot acknowledge 8.2.66 and the outcome of its  application and consequently cannot apply there. But this contradicts what we observe in the  derivation of ko’siñcat where, in order to get the correct final form, we ought to apply 6.1.113  to kar + asiñcat which is the direct outcome of the application of 8.2.66. 

Nyāsa on 6.1.113 acknowledges this problem but is unable to solve it. It says: the only rU that  we find in the Aṣṭādhyāyī results from the application of 8.2.66. So Pāṇini would not have  composed 6.1.113 which applies to rU if he intended for the outcome of the application of  8.2.66 (i.e., rU) to be asiddha with respect to 6.1.113.18 Buiskool (1939: 101) thinks that Pāṇini  has placed 6.1.113 in 6.1 only because of its similarity with the rules that precede and follow  it. 

Here is a possible solution to this problem: I think that, in the Pāṇinian system, all possible  rules that can be applied while constructing a word ought to be applied before the word enters  a sentence. Let us call them word-level rules. Let us call those rules which apply after the word  enters the sentence, sentence-level rules. I think Pāṇini does not consider word-level rules to  be asiddha with respect to sentence-level rules. 8.2.66 is a word-level rule simply because it  can be applied before the word enters the sentence, and thus is not asiddha with respect to  6.1.113, which by virtue of applying at the boundary between two words is a sentence-level  rule.19 

We do not find any examples of SOI or DOI involving 6.1.86 ṣatvatukor asiddhaḥ. Let us now  look at some derivations involving 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham, and also how this rule interacts with SOI and DOI. 

18 Yadi rutvam asiddhaṁ syāt tadā sthānitvena ror āśrayaṇam anarthakaṁ syāt. kasyacid  ukārānubandhaviśiṣṭasya ror asambhavāt. 

19 However, I must admit that there exist other cases of this kind which remain intractable or  unexplainable. For example, see example 15 of section 4.3, chapter 4 where 6.1.101 applies after the  application of 8.2.28. 

175 

3) rājan + bhis – ‘king’, instrumental plural 

Here, we apply 8.2.7 nalopaḥ prātipadikāntasya (which teaches that the final n of a nominal  stem termed pada is replaced with LOPA) and get rāja + bhis. By 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham20,  rules like 7.1.9 ato bhisa ais21, 7.3.102 supi ca22 and 7.3.103 bahuvacane jhaly et23 which are  applicable when deriving the instrumental plural of a-final stems, do not acknowledge the  existence of 8.2.7. Consequently, they cannot acknowledge the outcome of its application  either. Therefore, they are not applicable here. The correct form is rājabhiḥ.  

If Pāṇini had not taught 8.2.1, we would have got the incorrect form *rājaiḥ (cf. 7.1.9 ato bhisa  ais). 

4) asmai + uddhara ‘lift (it) for him’  

The derivation proceeds as follows: asmai + uddhara 🡪 asmāy + uddhara (6.1.78  eco’yavāyāvaḥ24) 🡪 asmā + uddhara (8.3.19 lopaḥ śākalyasya25). By 8.2.1, 8.3.19 is asiddha with respect to 6.1.87 ād guṇaḥ, which teaches that guṇa (a, e, o) replaces both a and the vowel  immediately following it. Thus, the outcome of the application of 8.3.19 (i.e., asmā + uddhara)  too is asiddha with respect to 6.1.87. Therefore, 6.1.87 is not applicable here. The correct  phrase is asmā uddhara. 

20 Technically, there is a rule more specific than 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham which teaches this asiddhatva.  This rule is 8.2.2 nalopaḥ supsvarasaṁjñātugvidhiṣu kr̥ti, which teaches that the rule teaching n deletion is suspended with respect to rules pertaining to declension (suP), accent (svara), technical  designations (saṁjñā) and introduction of augment tUK before a kr̥t affix. 8.2.2 is a niyama sūtra, which  allows n-deletion to be asiddha only in the aforementioned circumstances.  

21 Ais replaces bhis when bhis occurs after an a-final base. 

22 The a at the end of a nominal base is replaced with its long equivalent when followed by a  declensional affix starting with yaÑ (i.e., y, v, r l, jh, bh or any nasal). 

23 The a at the end of a nominal base is replaced with e when followed by a plural declensional affix  starting with jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative).  

24 An eC (e, o, ai, au) is replaced with ay, av, āy, āv respectively, when a vowel follows. 25 A pada-final v or y which occurs after a or ā is, in the opinion of Śākalya, replaced with LOPA when aŚ (any voiced sound) follows.

176 

If Pāṇini had not taught 8.2.1, we would have got the incorrect phrase *asmoddhara (cf. 6.1.87  ād guṇaḥ). 

Derivations 3 and 4 involve 8.2.1 but do not involve any cases of DOI or SOI. Now let us look  at examples 5 and 6 which, alongside 8.2.1, also involve cases of DOI and SOI respectively. 

5) bhujO + Kta – ‘to bend’, past passive participle 

 bhu j + ta 

 8.2.30 8.2.45 

8.2.30 coḥ kuḥ: a sound denoted by cU (palatals) is replaced with a corresponding sound  denoted by kU (velars) when cU occurs at the end of a pada or is followed by jhaL (a non nasal stop or a fricative). 

8.2.45 oditaś ca: the t of a niṣṭhā affix26 which occurs after a verbal root marked with O is  replaced with n. 

This is a case of DOI. Both rules lie in the tripādī. Thus, 8.2.30 does not acknowledge the  existence of 8.2.45. As stated before, I think that 1.4.2 comes into play only if the two rules  can acknowledge each other’s existence. Thus, 1.4.2 cannot address this case of DOI. 

Therefore, the rule that cannot see the other rule applies here, and we get: bhug + ta (8.2.30).  Now, 8.2.45 applies and we get the correct form bhugna. 

In order to understand the crucial role played by 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham in this derivation, let  us analyse how this derivation would have proceeded in its absence: 

 bhu j + ta 

 8.2.30 8.2.45 

8.2.30 coḥ kuḥ: same as above. 

8.2.45 oditaś ca: same as above.

This is a case of DOI. But before we look at the outcome (as per my interpretation of 1.4.2),  let us understand the relationship between 8.2.30 and 8.2.45. If we apply 8.2.30 at this step,  8.2.45 will be applicable at the following step (as seen in the derivation of bhugna above). But  if we apply 8.2.45 at this step, then t will be replaced with n, which does not belong to jhaL.  Thus 8.2.30 will not be applicable at the following step. In other words, the RHS rule 8.2.45  blocks the LHS rule 8.2.30, but the LHS rule 8.2.30 does not block the RHS rule 8.2.45. This  is a case of unidirectional blocking. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 8.2.45 applies and we get bhuj + na. As stated  above, 8.2.45 blocks 8.2.30. Thus, 8.2.30 is unable to apply to bhuj + na, and we get the  incorrect form bhujna 🡪 *bhujña (8.4.40 stoś ścunā ścuḥ). 

To get the correct form, one needs to apply both rules, 8.2.30 and 8.2.45, in two consecutive  steps. Since 8.2.45 unidirectionally blocks 8.2.30, the only way to apply both rules, is to apply  them in the following order: first, 8.2.30, and then, 8.2.45. For this, one needs to devise a way  to neutralize the impact of 1.4.2. Pāṇini has achieved this with the help of 8.2.1. He has placed 

8.2.45 (the RHS rule) after 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham and also after the LHS rule 8.2.30 in the  serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. This enables 8.2.30 to ignore 8.2.45 and consequently, to apply  before the application of 8.2.45.  

Let me state in general terms how Pāṇini uses 8.2.1 to impact certain cases of DOI. In those  cases of DOI wherein the RHS rule unidirectionally blocks the LHS rule, and where Pāṇini  wants both the RHS and LHS rules to apply, he places the RHS rule after 8.2.1 and after the  LHS rule in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. In simple words, when required, Pāṇini uses  8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham to neutralize the impact of 1.4.2 on those cases of DOI which involve 

unidirectional blocking, where it is desirable for him to do so.27 

27 Even though the traditional understanding of vipratiṣedha is different from mine, it must be  mentioned here that, in his first vārttika on 8.2.1, Kātyāyana says: pūrvatrāsiddhe nāsti  vipratiṣedho’bhāvād uttarasya “in the section headed by 8.2.1, vipratiṣedha does not arise because of  the absence [i.e., suspension] of the rule which comes later in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial order” (Mbh  III.385.14).

6) dah + tumUN – ‘to burn’, infinitive 

da h + tum 

 8.2.31 8.2.32 

8.2.31 ho ḍhaḥ: h is replaced with ḍh when h occurs at the end of a pada, or when it is followed  by jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative). 

8.2.32 dāder dhātor ghaḥ: gh replaces the final h of a verbal root beginning with d when it  occurs at the end of a pada or is followed by jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative). 

Because 8.2.32 is in the section governed by 8.2.1 and follows 8.2.31 in the serial order of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī, it is asiddha with respect to 8.2.31. According to the tradition, since 8.2.32 is  asiddha with respect to 8.2.31, 8.2.31 should apply here. This, however, gives daḍh + tum,  which leads to the wrong form *dāḍhum.28 

Kātyāyana acknowledges the fact that, to get the correct answer, we need to apply 8.2.32 which  is the exception, and not 8.2.31, which is the general rule. However, he assumes that the  exception rule cannot win if it is asiddha with respect to the general rule. To tackle this  problem, in vt. 229 on 8.2.1, he says: apavādo vacanaprāmāṇyāt ‘the exception [wins] on the  authority of the statement [of rule 8.2.32]’. 

Thus, for the tradition, the exception rule 8.2.32 is not asiddha with respect to the general rule  8.2.31, thanks to Kātyāyana’s vārttika. Therefore, the former wins, leading to the correct form: dah + tum 🡪 dagh + tum (8.2.32 dāder dhātor ghaḥ) 🡪 dagh + dhum (8.2.40 jhaṣas tathor  dho’dhaḥ) 🡪 dagdhum (8.4.53 jhalāṁ jaś jhaśi). 

I disagree with the tradition. I think that, in case of SOI, the more specific rule wins even if it  is asiddha with respect to the general rule. Let me explain why. We know that Pāṇini has  instructed us on how to tackle DOI through his rule 1.4.2, but he has not given any instructions  about dealing with SOI. Similarly, I think that, in teaching 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham and 6.4.22  

28 dah + tum 🡪 daḍh + tum (8.2.31) 🡪 daḍh + dhum (8.2.40 jhaṣas tathor dho’dhaḥ) 🡪 daḍh + ḍhum (8.4.41 ṣṭunā ṣṭuḥ) 🡪 da + ḍhum (8.3.13 ḍho ḍhe lopaḥ) 🡪 *dāḍhum (6.3.111 ḍhralope pūrvasya  dīrgho’ṇaḥ).  

29 Mbh III.385.19-21.

179 

asiddhavad atrā bhāt, Pāṇini has given instructions vis-à-vis DOI but not vis-à-vis SOI. In  other words, 8.2.1 and 6.4.22 have no impact on SOI. Consider the following situation: 

K + L 

 R1K R2K R1L R2L  We know that there is an SOI between R1K and R2K, and an SOI between R1L and R2L. Before  1.4.2, 8.2.1 and 6.4.22 can potentially exert their influence, Pāṇini resolves both these SOIs.  Let us assume that R1K is more specific that R2K, thus R1K wins. Similarly, let us assume that  R1L is more specific than R2L, thus R1L wins. The above diagram can be redrawn as follows,  by omitting to mention the losing rules: 

K + L 

 R1K R1L  

Now, 1.4.2, 8.2.1 and 6.4.22 can potentially come into play. If neither of the two rules are  governed by 8.2.1 or 6.4.22, then by my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule R1L applies at  this step. If 8.2.1 governs one of the two rules, that is, for example, if R1L is asiddha with  respect to R1K, then 1.4.2, which I think comes into the picture only when both rules  acknowledge each other’s existence, cannot resolve this DOI. By 8.2.1, R1K applies at this step.  I hope this disambiguates my proposition that 1.4.2, 8.2.1 etc. are relevant in regard with DOI  but not in regard with SOI.  

Coming back to the present example, I think the fact that 8.2.32 is asiddha with respect to  8.2.31 has no bearing on our method of resolving SOI, which requires us to pick the more  specific rule. The more specific rule 8.2.32 wins despite being asiddha with respect to the  general rule 8.2.31. 

Now let us examine 6.4.22 asiddhavad atrā bhāt. As stated in section 5.1 of this chapter,  according to the Kāśikā, 6.4.22 means: 

A is asiddhavat with respect to B if: 

(i) both A and B are taught in 6.4.22 – 6.4.175 (ā bhāt), and 

(ii) both A and B have a samānāśraya ‘common substratum’ (atra).

180I disagree with Kāśikā’s interpretation of all three parts of this rule, namely asiddhavat, ā bhāt and atra. Let us begin by looking at asiddhavat. As stated in section 5.1, the tradition does not  differentiate between asiddha and asiddhavat. It interprets both of them as ‘suspended’.  However, I do not think that Pāṇini would have added -vat to asiddha if he wanted to convey  a meaning that can be conveyed by asiddha itself.  

In fact, asiddhavat is derived by adding the taddhita affix vatI to asiddha + Ṭā (cf. 5.1.115  tena tulyaṁ kriyā cedvatiḥ30). Ṭā is later deleted by 2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ, thereby  leading to the form asiddhavat, which means ‘like asiddha’. So, asiddhavat is different from  yet similar to asiddha. 

We know that asiddha implies śāstrāsiddhi (‘Rule X is suspended with respect to rule Y’)  which in turn always entails kāryāsiddhi (‘The outcome of the application of rule X is suspended with respect to rule Y’). Because asiddha and asiddhavat have different meanings,  the only possible interpretation of asiddhavat is kāryāsiddhi: ‘the outcome of the application  of rule X is suspended with respect to rule Y.’31 I will support this conclusion with more  evidence later in this chapter. The meanings of asiddha and asiddhavat can be summarized as  follows: 

Type 

	śāstrāsiddhi 

	kāryāsiddhi

	asiddha 

	Yes 

	Yes

	asiddhavat 

	No 

	Yes

	







30 The taddhita affix vatI occurs to denote the sense of tulya ‘similar to, comparable with’ after a  syntactically related nominal stem ending in tr̥tīyā ‘instrumental’, provided what is tulya is also kriyā  ‘action’. 

31 Cardona (1997: 425) too holds this opinion: “I differ from Pāṇinīyas in my interpretation of 6.4.22  [asiddhavad atrābhāt]. Pāṇinīyas maintain that this too should be considered to provide for rule  suspension (śāstrāsiddhatvam), not the suspension of what results from applying rules  (kāryāsiddhatvam)”.

181 

So, how does 6.4.22, which teaches asiddhavat, interact with 1.4.2?  

(i) In case of DOI between two rules, if these two rules are asiddhavat with respect to each  other, they acknowledge each other’s existence (because there is no śāstrāsiddhi). This allows  the resolution of the DOI by 1.4.2.  

(ii) Each of these two rules involved in DOI does not acknowledge the outcome of the  application of the other (because there is kāryāsiddhi). This ensures that, after the RHS rule  has applied (by my interpretation of 1.4.2), the LHS rule always applies at the following step,  because it does not acknowledge the outcome of the application of the RHS rule.  

This will become clearer in the examples below. Now let us attempt to decipher the meaning  of ā bhāt in 6.4.22 asiddhavad atrā bhāt. As stated in section 5.1 of this chapter, Kātyāyana  and Patañjali discuss both possibilities: one, that the jurisdiction of 6.4.22 ends at 6.4.129, and  the other, that it continues up to the end of 6.4. 

I think that the adhikāra of 6.4.22 ends at 6.4.129. Let me explain why this is the case. We  know how Pāṇini indicates the boundary of adhikāra sūtras: he uses either ā or prāk in  conjunction with a term from the sūtra which constitutes the boundary, in the ablative. For  example, consider 1.4.1 ā kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā , the jurisdiction of which ends at 2.2.38 kaḍārāḥ 

karmadhāraye and 4.1.83 prāg dīvyato’ṇ, the jurisdiction of which ends at 4.4.2 tena dīvyati  khanati jayati jitam. So, if Pāṇini wanted to state that the adhikāra of 6.4.22 continues up to  6.4.175 r̥tvyavāstvyavāstvamādhvīhiraṇyayāni cchandasi, then he would have said, in 6.4.22,  asiddhavad atra ā r̥tvyāt (which, after sandhi, becomes asiddhavad atrārtvyāt). But since he  has said asiddhavad atrābhāt, the jurisdiction of 6.4.22 continues only up to 6.4.129 bhasya. 

The examples discussed below will buttress my position. 

Now let us examine the word atra in 6.4.22. As stated in section 5.1 of this chapter, Kātyāyana  discusses two possible interpretations of the word atra. One is samānāśrayatva ‘common  substratum’ and the other ‘with respect to the rules taught here’. Only one of the two  interpretations can be correct, and I think that it is the latter, for reasons that I will now explain.  

Firstly, notice that in 8.2.1 we find another term which like a-tra, ends in the affix traL, namely  pūrva-tra. There, pūrva-tra means ‘with respect to the rules taught before (in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s  serial order)’. This strongly suggests that in 6.4.22, atra, which also ends in tra, means ‘with  respect to the rules taught here (in the section governed by 6.4.22)’. 

182 

Secondly, consider Kāśikā’s interpretation of 6.4.22: that which is taught in the section starting  here and extending up to the end of 6.4 (ā bhāt) is suspended (asiddhavat), if both rules have  a samānāśraya ‘common substratum’ (atra). It infers samānāśrayatva from the word atra. But  if we assume that atra impliessamānāśrayatva, then it followsthat Pāṇini has not said anything  about the rules with respect to which the rules in the section headed by 6.4.22 are asiddhavat. 

As I have stated earlier, in such a case, rules in the ābhīya section become asiddhavat with  respect to, for example, rules from adhyāya seven, which is not desirable. This too indicates  that atra means ‘with respect to the rules taught here (i.e., in the section 6.4.22-6.4.129)’. I will  discuss this further when dealing with specific examples below.  

Now that I have discussed my opinion about all three parts of 6.4.22, namely asiddhavat, atra and ā bhāt, here is my interpretation of 6.4.22: 

6.4.22 asiddhavad atrā bhāt: the outcome of the application of a rule taught in the section  6.4.22-6.4.129, is not acknowledged by any other rule taught here (atra), that is, in the section  6.4.22-6.4.129. 

For the sake of clarity, I reproduce the table dealing with the difference between asiddha and  asiddhavat below: 

Type 

	śāstrāsiddhi 

	kāryāsiddhi

	asiddha 

	Yes 

	Yes

	asiddhavat 

	No 

	Yes

	







Before we look at derivations involving 6.4.22, here is a summary of my interpretation of all  three rules:

183 

A 

	B 

	C

	Rule 

	Rules which are asiddha (under 6.1.86 and 8.2.1) /  asiddhavat (under 6.4.22)

	Rules with respect to which rules in  column B are asiddha (under 6.1.86 and  8.2.1) / asiddhavat (under 6.4.22)

	6.1.86 

ṣatvatukor  

asiddhaḥ (ekaḥ pūrvaparayoḥ)

	Any rule teaching ekādeśa  (6.1.84-6.1.108)

	Any rule teaching introduction of  augment tUK (e.g., 6.1.71 hrasvasya  piti kr̥ti tuk) or replacement of s with ṣ (e.g., 8.3.59 ādeśapratyayoḥ)

	8.2.1 

pūrvatrāsiddham

	Any rule G that comes after  8.2.1 in the serial order of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī

	Any rule F which comes before rule G (see column B) in the serial order of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī

	6.4.22 

asiddhavad atrā  bhāt

	Any rule taught in 6.4.22- 6.4.129.

	Any rule taught in 6.4.22-6.4.129.

	







Let us now look at derivations which involve both SOI and 6.4.22.  

7) han + siP – ‘to hurt’, imperative second-person singular32 

han + siP 

 3.1.68 3.4.87  

3.1.68 kartari śap: affix ŚaP occurs after a verbal root when a sārvadhātuka affix which  denotes kartr̥ ‘agent’ follows. 

3.4.87 ser hy apic ca: a siP replacement of LOṬ is replaced with hi and is treated as if not  marked with P. 

This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.87 and get han  + hi. Thereafter the derivation proceeds as follows: han + hi 🡪 han + ŚaP + hi (3.1.68) 🡪 

32 We have performed an almost identical derivation in chapter 4 (see derivation 10, section 4.3). There,  we replaced hi with tātAṄ, by the optional rule 7.1.35 tuhyos tātaṅ āśiṣy anyatarasyām. Here, however,  we will not apply 7.1.35.

184 

han + hi (2.4.72 adiprabhr̥tibhyaḥ śapaḥ). Now, han can be called an aṅga with respect to hi  (cf. my interpretation of 1.4.13). Thus, the following rules from the aṅgādhikāra become  applicable: 

han + hi 

 6.4.36 6.4.37  

6.4.36 hanter jaḥ: the root han is replaced with ja when the affix hi follows. 

6.4.37 anudāttopadeśavanatitanotyādīnām anunāsikalopo jhali kṅiti: the final nasal of a base  marked with anudātta when taught in the Dhātupāṭha, as well as of vanA ‘to like’ and the roots  headed by tanU ‘to extend’, is replaced with LOPA when an affix beginning with jhaL (a non nasal stop or a fricative) and marked with K or Ṅ follows.33 

There is an SOI relationship between 6.4.36 and 6.4.37. 6.4.36 is specifically taught for han +  hi, so it is more specific than 6.4.37.  

Note that the two rules 6.4.36 and 6.4.37 have been taught in the asiddhavat section. However,  as argued above (see example 6), Pāṇini’s rules 8.2.1 and 6.4.22 deal with DOI, but not with  SOI. Like 8.2.1, 6.4.22 too has no impact on SOI. Here, the more specific rule 6.4.36 wins, and  we get jahi, which is the correct form. 

Now let us imagine what would have happened in the absence of 6.4.22. The following rule  would have become applicable to ja + hi: 

6.4.105 ato heḥ: a hi which comes after a base ending in a is replaced with LUK.  

This would have given the incorrect form *ja. 6.4.22 helps us avoid deriving this incorrect  form: as taught by 6.4.22, 6.4.36 is asiddhavat with respect to 6.4.105. So even though 6.4.105  can acknowledge the existence of 6.4.36, it cannot acknowledge the outcome of the application  of 6.4.36. As a result, 6.4.105 is not applicable to jahi. 

33 Since hi is a sārvadhātuka which is not marked with P, we can say that it is marked with K by 1.2.4  sārvadhātukam apit. Thus 6.4.37 is applicable. 

185 

8) bhū + tas – ‘to be’, perfect third-person dual 

bhū + tas 

 6.1.8 3.4.82 

6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya: a verbal base which has not undergone reduplication undergoes  reduplication when followed by LIṬ.34 

3.4.82 parasmaipadānāṁ ṇalatususthalathusaṇalvamāḥ: ṆaL, atus, us, thaL, athus, a, ṆaL, va and ma respectively come in place of the nine parasmaipada replacements of LIṬ namely tiP,  tas, jhi, siP, thas, tha, miP, vas and mas. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.82 and get: bhū + atus. Here, three  rules are applicable: 

 bhū + atus 

 6.4.77 6.1.8 6.4.88  

6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya: same as above. 

6.4.77 aci śnudhātubhruvāṁ yvor iyaṅuvaṅau: the final i and u of Śnu, and of any verbal base,  and of bhrū ‘brow’ are replaced with iyAṄ and uvAṄ, respectively, when an affix beginning  with a vowel follows. 

6.4.88 bhuvo vug luṅliṭoḥ: augment vUK is attached to bhū when a LUṄ or LIṬ affix beginning  with a vowel follows. 

This is a case of SOI. Note that 6.4.77 and 6.4.88 both belong to the section headed by 6.4.22.  However, as stated above, 6.4.22 does not impact SOI. Let us find out which of the three rules  is the most specific. 

6.4.77 aci śnudhātubhruvāṁ yvor iyaṅuvaṅau 

bhū + affix beginning with aC 

other conditions 

34 Note that, the whole base does not undergo reduplication. Instead, only one syllable does. See 6.1.1  ekāco dve prathamasya and 6.1.2 ajāder dvitīyasya.

186 

6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya 

bhū + affix beginning with aC (LIṬ) 

other conditions 

6.4.88 bhuvo vug luṅliṭoḥ 

bhū + affix beginning with aC (LIṬ) 

bhū + affix beginning with aC (LUṄ) 

other conditions 

6.4.88 and 6.1.8 are both more specific than 6.4.77 because 6.4.77 has not been taught  specifically for LIṬ. Between 6.4.88 and 6.1.8, 6.1.8 is more specific because it has been taught  exclusively for LIṬ, whereas 6.4.88 has been taught for both LUṄ and LIṬ. 

Thus, 6.1.8 emerges as the most specific rule. Upon applying it, we get: bhūbhū + atus. Here  the following rules are applicable: 

bh ū bh ū + atus 

 7.4.73 6.4.88 6.4.77 

7.4.73 bhavater aḥ: a replaces the last sound of the abhyāsa of bhū ‘to be’ when LIṬ follows. 6.4.88 bhuvo vug luṅliṭoḥ: same as above. 

6.4.77 aci śnudhātubhruvāṁ yvor iyaṅuvaṅau: same as above. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we perform the RHS operation. But which of the two RHS rules  should we apply? As stated above, there is an SOI between 6.4.88 and 6.4.77, and the more  specific rule 6.4.88 wins. Thus, we get: bhūbhūv + atus. At this step, 7.4.43 applies, giving us  bhabhūv + atus. Now that all rules from the sapādasaptādhyāyī have applied, the rule 8.4.54  abhyāse car ca applies, thereby giving the correct form: babhūvatuḥ.  

In vt. 1435 on 6.4.22, Kātyāyana alludes to the interaction between vUK (6.4.88) and uvAṄ (6.4.77). He says: vugyuṭāv uvaṅyaṇoḥ ‘rules teaching augments vUK and yUṬ [should be siddha and not asiddhavat] with respect to rules teaching uvAṄ and yaṆ’. This vārttika is  

35 Mbh III.191.15.

187 

premised on the assumption that, if 6.4.88 bhuvo vug luṅliṭoḥ is asiddhavat (which according  to the tradition, has the same meaning as asiddha) with respect to 6.4.77 aci śnudhātubhruvāṁ yvor iyaṅuvaṅau, then 6.4.77 will apply, giving the wrong answer *babhuvatuḥ.  

However, as I have shown in the derivation above, there is an SOI between 6.4.77 and 6.4.88,  and 6.4.22 has no impact on SOI. Thus, Pāṇini’s system correctly derives this form, and this  vārttika is not required to assist in the process. 

Now let us consider an example which demonstrates the impact of 6.4.22 on DOI. 

9) śās + siP – ‘to teach’, imperative second-person singular36 

śās + siP 

 3.1.68 3.4.87 

3.1.68 kartari śap: affix ŚaP occurs after a verbal root when a sārvadhātuka affix which  denotes kartr̥ ‘agent’ follows. 

3.4.87 ser hy apic ca: a siP replacement of LOṬ is replaced with hi and is treated as if not  marked with P. 

This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.87 and get śās  + hi. Thereafter, the derivation proceeds as follows: śās + hi 🡪 śās + ŚaP + hi (3.1.68) 🡪 śās  + hi (2.4.72 adiprabhr̥tibhyaḥ śapaḥ37). śās can now be called an aṅga with respect to hi (cf.  my interpretation of 1.4.13). Thus, the following rules from the aṅgādhikāra become  applicable: 

śās + hi 

 6.4.34 6.4.35 6.4.101  

36 We have performed this derivation in chapter 4. See derivation 9 of section 4.3. There, we replaced  hi with tātAṄ, by the optional rule 7.1.35 tuhyos tātaṅ āśiṣy anyatarasyām. Here, however, we will not  do so. 

37 Affix ŚaP is replaced with LUK when it occurs after roots belonging to the set headed by adA ‘to eat’ (second class).

188 

6.4.34 śāsa id aṅhaloḥ: the penultimate sound of śās, is replaced with short i when followed  by aṄ, or an affix that begins with a consonant and is marked with K or Ṅ. 38 

6.4.35 śā hau: śās is replaced with śā when affix hi follows. 

6.4.101 hujhalbhyo her dhiḥ: hi is replaced with dhi when it occurs after root hu or after a form  ending in jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative). 

There is an SOI between 6.4.34 and 6.4.35. As stated before, 6.4.22 does not impact SOI. 6.4.35  is more specific because it pertains to hi alone and thus wins.  

Now we shall focus on the interaction between 6.4.35 and 6.4.101. Note that both these rules  fall under the heading rule 6.4.22 asiddhavad atrābhāt. Thus 6.4.35 can acknowledge the  existence of 6.4.101 but cannot acknowledge the outcome of the application of 6.4.101.  Similarly, 6.4.101 can acknowledge the existence of 6.4.35 but not the outcome of the  application of 6.4.35. 

Since 6.4.35 and 6.4.101 acknowledge each other’s existence, we can use 1.4.2 to deal with  this case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.101 and get śās +  dhi. Since 6.4.101 is asiddhavat with respect to 6.4.35, 6.4.35 does not acknowledge the  outcome of the application of 6.4.101. Thus 6.4.35 applies and we get the correct form: śādhi. 

In order to understand the crucial role played by 6.4.22 in this derivation, let us analyse how  this derivation would have proceeded in its absence. We will directly look at the relevant step: 

śās + hi 

 6.4.35 6.4.101 

Let us examine the relationship between 6.4.35 and 6.4.101. If, by 6.4.35, we replace śās with  śā at this step, then 6.4.101, which applies to hi when hi is preceded by jhaL, will not be  applicable at the following step. If, by 6.4.101, we replace hi with dhi at this step, then 6.4.35,  which applies to śās when it is followed by hi, will not be applicable at the following step. This  is a case of mutual blocking in DOI.  

38 hi is an apit (cf. 3.4.87 ser hy apic ca) sārvadhātuka, and so by 1.2.4 sārvadhātukam apit, we can say  that it is marked with K or Ṅ. Thus, 6.4.34 is applicable here. 

189 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.101 and get śās + dhi. As stated  above, 6.4.35 is not applicable after the application of 6.4.101. Thus, the final form is *śāsdhi,  which is incorrect. To get the correct form śādhi, we need to apply both 6.4.35 and 6.4.101.  However, since both rules block each other, only one can apply in this derivation. To overcome  this problem, Pāṇini has put them both in the section headed by 6.4.22. 

6.4.22 teaches that the two rules within 6.4.22-6.4.129 are asiddhavat with respect to each  other. At the risk of repetition, let me state that this ensures two things: 

(i) Both rules acknowledge each other’s existence. This allows the resolution of the DOI by  (my interpretation of) 1.4.2.  

(ii) Each of the two rules does not acknowledge the outcome of the application of the other.  This ensures that, after the RHS rule has applied (by my interpretation of 1.4.2), the LHS rule  applies at the following step, because it does not acknowledge the outcome of the application  of the RHS rule.  

Let me state in general terms what we have seen in this derivation. In those cases of DOI  wherein two rules block each other, and where Pāṇini wants both rules to apply, he places them  in the section 6.4.22-6.4.129. In simple words, when required, Pāṇini uses 6.4.22 asiddhavad  atrā bhāt to neutralize the impact of 1.4.2 (as interpreted by me) on those cases of DOI which  involve mutual blocking, where it is desirable for him to do so. Contrast this with 8.2.1, which  as I have stated earlier, is leveraged by Pāṇini to neutralize the impact of 1.4.2 on those cases  of DOI which involve unidirectional blocking.39 

Note that, if Pāṇini had taught 6.4.22 as asiddham atrā bhāt instead of asiddhavad atrā bhāt,  then both rules, namely 6.4.35 and 6.4.101, would not be able to acknowledge each other. Thus,  both would try to apply to their respective operands. Since only one rule can apply at any given  step, the machine would have come to a halt.  

Now, through the following derivation, I will provide evidence to support my claim that the  jurisdiction of 6.4.22 ends at 6.4.129. 

39 For more examples of the impact of 6.4.22 on DOI, see derivations 24 and 26 of section 4.3, chapter 4.

19010) Let us derive the accusative plural of the Vedic perfect participle of pā ‘to drink’: pā + LIṬ ‘he who had drunk’40. 

 pā + LIṬ 

 6.1.8 3.2.107 

6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya: an un-reduplicated verbal base undergoes reduplication when  followed by LIṬ.41 

3.2.107 kvasuś ca: KvasU optionally replaces LIṬ in Vedic when the action is denoted in the  past. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.2.107 and get pā + KvasU. Here the  following rules are applicable: 

 pā + vas  

 6.1.8 4.1.2 

6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya: same as above. 

4.1.2 svaujasamauṭchaṣṭābhyāmbhisṅebhyāmbhyasṅasibhyāmbhyasṅasosāmṅyossup42 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 4.1.2 and get: pā + vas + Śas. Here, the  following rules are applicable: 

pā + vas + Śas 

 6.1.8 6.4.131  

40 In contrast with other derivations, where, for brevity’s sake, I start the derivation directly with the  substitute of the lakāra, here I have started this unconventional derivation with LIṬ for the sake of  clarity. 

41 Note that the whole base does not undergo reduplication. Instead, only one syllable does. See 6.1.1  ekāco dve prathamasya and 6.1.2 ajāder dvitīyasya. 

42 This is applicable because KvasU is a kr̥t affix (cf. 1.2.46 kr̥ttaddhitasamāsāś ca).

191 

6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya: same as above. 

6.4.131 vasoḥ samprasāraṇam: the semivowel of the affix vasU in an item termed bha is  replaced with the corresponding vowel u. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.131 and get pā + uas + Śas. Here,  the following rules are applicable: 

pā + uas + Śas 

 6.4.64 6.1.8 6.1.108 

6.4.64 āto lopa iṭi ca: the final ā of a base is replaced with LOPA when followed by augment  iṬ or an ārdhadhātuka affix which begins with a vowel and is marked with K or Ṅ. 

6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya: same as above. 

6.1.108 samprasāraṇāc ca: a samprasāraṇa vowel and the following vowel, are together  replaced with the former. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS 6.1.108 rule and get pā + us + Śas. Here, two  rules are applicable: 

pā + us + Śas 

 6.1.8 6.4.64  

6.4.64 āto lopa iṭi ca: same as above. 

6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya: same as above. 

This is a case of SOI. Let us compare the two rules to determine which one is more specific: 6.4.64 

ā + affix beginning with vowel (ārdhadhātuka) (marked with K or Ṅ) other conditions 

6.1.8  

ā + affix beginning with vowel (LIṬ) 

other conditions

192 

We cannot say that one rule is more specific than the other in this scenario. So, which of the  two rules should we apply here?  

Let us understand the relationship between the two rules. 

In pā + us + Śas, if we apply 6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya, we get pāpā + us + Śas. 6.4.64  āto lopa iṭi ca is still applicable here.  

But in pā + us + Śas, if we apply 6.4.64 (which teaches the substitution of ā with ø i.e., LOPA),  we get pø + us + Śas. Here, is 6.1.8 applicable?  

Pāṇini has taught the rule 1.1.59 dvirvacane’ci, which, according to the Kāśikā43, teaches that  the substitute of a vowel is treated like its substituendum (i.e., the said vowel) – for the purpose  of reduplication alone – when it is followed by a vowel-initial affix which conditions reduplication of the verbal base. So, in pø + us + Śas, by 1.1.59, we can treat LOPA (ø), which  is the substitute of vowel ā, as the substituendum ā, because it is followed by the vowel-initial  affix us which causes reduplication. Therefore, 6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya is applicable here. 

We have seen that the two rules do not block each other and we can apply them in any order. I  think Pāṇini composed 1.1.59 to ensure that, if we apply 6.4.64 to pā + us + Śas, 6.1.8 can still  be applied at the following step.  

After applying both 6.4.64 and 6.1.8, we get pāp + us + Śas. To this we apply 7.4.59 hrasvaḥ44 and get the correct form: papuṣaḥ.45 

As stated before, according to my interpretation of 6.4.22 asiddhavad atrā bhāt, the jurisdiction  of 6.4.22 ends at 6.4.129.  

However, in the opinion of the Kāśikā, this jurisdiction continues up to the end of 6.4 (i.e.,  6.4.175) and, therefore, it creates a difficulty in the derivation of papuṣaḥ. As seen above,  6.4.131 vasoḥ samprasāraṇam changes vas to uas. Since uas begins with a vowel, 6.4.64 āto  

43 Note that the Mahābhāṣya discusses two possible interpretations of 1.1.59. I have mentioned the one  accepted by the Kāśikā. I think this is the correct interpretation. The Kaumudī accepts the other  interpretation, which I think is incorrect. I will not discuss the same here because it is not directly related  to the topic of asiddhavat. 

44 The vowel of the abhyāsa ‘first of two reduplicated syllables’ is replaced with its short counterpart. 45 8.3.59 ādeśapratyayoḥ.

193 

lopa iṭi ca becomes applicable to the ā of pā. However, both 6.4.64 and 6.4.131 lie within  6.4.22 – 6.4.175, which is the jurisdiction of 6.4.22 according to the Kāśikā. Thus, the Kāśikā deems them asiddhavat with respect to each other. Consequently, 6.4.64 does not acknowledge  the outcome of the application of 6.4.131. In other words, it does not acknowledge the change  from vas to uas and cannot apply. This gives the incorrect form: papā + usas 🡪 *paposas  (6.1.87 ād guṇaḥ). 

I think the tradition interprets atra as samānāśraya for the sole purpose of overcoming this  problem. According to the Kāśikā, two rules can be called asiddhavat by 6.4.22 only if they  have a samānāśraya ‘common substratum’. Without explaining exactly what this means, the  Kāśikā gives the following example: 6.4.131 and 6.4.64 do not have a samānāśraya, and thus  they are not asiddhavat with respect to each other.46 Consequently, 6.4.64 acknowledges  6.4.131 and applies to papā + uṣaḥ (which has been derived by applying 6.4.131). In this way,  we get the correct form papuṣaḥ.  

But what exactly does samānāśraya stand for? The Nyāsa glosses āśraya as nimitta ‘cause’.  So according to the Nyāsa, a rule is asiddhavat with respect to another only if the two rules have a samānāśraya ‘common cause’. However, I do not think that here āśraya means nimitta.  Let me explain why, by looking at another derivation: at the step śās + hi (see derivation 9 of  this section), 6.4.35 śā hau which applies to śās is caused by hi, while 6.4.101 hujhalbhyo her  dhiḥ, which applies to hi, is caused by śās. Even though the two rules do not have the same  cause, the tradition deems them asiddhavat with respect to each other. So, when Kātyāyana  uses the word samānāśraya in vt. 12 samānāśrayavacanāt siddham, he does not imply ‘common cause’. What then does he mean? 

It is not possible to answer this question with certainty. But one can speculate that when  Kātyāyana says two rules are samānāśraya, he likely means that they pertain to the same set  of items. Both rules 6.4.101 and 6.4.35 pertain to śās + hi, thus they are samānāśraya and  asiddhavat with respect to each other. However, in our present example, 6.4.131 pertains to  vas + Śas, whereas 6.4.64 āto lopa iṭi ca pertains to papā + uas. The two rules have different  āśrayas ‘substrata’ and thus, according to the tradition, they are not asiddhavat with respect to  each other. 

46 On vt. 12 samānāśrayatvāt siddham, Patañjali says, samānāśrayam asiddhaṁ bhavati vyāśrayaṁ caitat. 

194 

Kātyāyana also offers another solution, which basically amounts to stating that this set of  examples should be exempt from following 6.4.22. In vt. 947 on 6.4.22, he teaches: siddhaṁ vasusamprasāraṇam ajvidhau ‘the samprasāraṇa of vasU should be siddha (rather than asiddhavat) with regard to an operation concerning vowels.’  

It is evident that the tradition struggles to resolve this problem and comes up with not one, but  two alternative ways of dealing with it. Not only does Kātyāyana write a vārttika contradicting  6.4.22, but he also concocts the concept of samānāśrayatva to address this difficulty. 

On the contrary, notice that, according to my interpretation of 6.4.22, 6.4.131 does not lie in  the ābhīya section (6.4.22-6.4.129). Thus, in my opinion, 6.4.131 is not asiddhavat with respect  to 6.4.64. Therefore, if we accept that the jurisdiction of 6.4.22 stops at 6.4.129, the challenges  faced by the tradition in deriving this form do not rise. My interpretation of atra (with respect  to the rules taught here, i.e., in the section headed by 6.4.22) and ā bhāt (up to 6.4.129) allows 

us to correctly derive papuṣaḥ without flouting 6.4.22. 

Kātyāyana also discusses other examples of this nature, wherein he has had to write ad hoc  vārttikas claiming that certain rules taught in the section 6.4.129-6.4.175, which, according to  him, constitute a part of the ābhīya section (6.4.22-6.4.175), are not asiddhavat, contrary to his  own interpretation of 6.4.22 (generally adopted by the later tradition).  

For example, the problem faced by the tradition in deriving paśuṣaḥ (accusative plural of paśu + saN ‘bestowing cattle’) is the same as the one faced in deriving papuṣaḥ. To avoid  redundancy, I will derive it by my method here without showing the DOI and SOI that might  arise at different steps: paśusaN + vIṬ (3.2.67 janasanakhanakramagamo viṭ) 🡪 paśusan +  vIṬ + Śas (4.1.2 svaujas…) 🡪 paśusan + ø + Śas (6.1.67 ver apr̥ktasya) 🡪 paśusaā + ø + Śas (6.4.41 viḍvanor anunāsikasyāt, 1.1.62 pratyayalope pratyayalakṣaṇam) 🡪 paśusa + Śas (6.4.140 āto dhātoḥ) 🡪 paśusas (6.1.97 ato guṇe) 🡪 paśuṣaḥ (8.3.108 sanoter anaḥ).  

As seen in this derivation, in order to correctly derive paśuṣaḥ, one needs to first apply 6.4.41  viḍvanor anunāsikasyāt and then 6.4.140 āto dhātoḥ. However, according to the tradition, since  the jurisdiction of 6.4.22 continues up to 6.4.175, 6.4.41 is asiddhavat with respect to 6.4.140.  Consequently 6.4.140 cannot apply after the application of 6.4.41. This creates an obstacle in  correctly deriving paśuṣaḥ. To deal with this problem, Kātyāyana has composed vt. 1148 on  

47 Mbh III.190.11. 

48 Mbh III.190.17.

195 

6.4.22, effectively negating 6.4.22: āttvaṁ yalopāllopayoḥ paśuṣo na vājān49 cākhāyitā  cākhāyitum ‘āttva (here, taught by 6.4.41) should be siddha when y-deletion and ā-deletion  (here, taught by 6.4.140) [can potentially take place e.g.,] paśuṣo na vājān, cākhāyitā [and]  cākhāyitum.’ But if one thinks, as I do, that the jurisdiction of 6.4.22 ends at 6.4.129, then this  problem simply does not arise. This is because 6.4.140 lies beyond 6.4.129, and therefore, in  my view, 6.4.41 is not asiddhavat with respect to 6.4.140.50 

Now, I will derive a certain form, then highlight the problem faced by the tradition in this  derivation vis-à-vis 6.4.22, and will show how, by following my method, we do not encounter  this problem at all. 

11) praśam + ṆiC51 – ‘to be pacified’, causative absolutive 

praś a m + ṆiC  

 7.2.116 3.4.21 7.2.116 ata upadhāyāḥ: vr̥ddhi replaces the penultimate sound a of a base when an affix marked  with Ṇ or Ñ follows. 

3.4.21 samānakartr̥kayoḥ pūrvakāle: affix Ktvā occurs after a verbal root which denotes a prior  action relative to some subsequent action provided both actions share the same agent. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.21 and get: praśam + ṆiC + Ktvā.  Here the following rules are applicable: 

 praś a m + ṆiC + Ktvā 

 7.2.116 7.1.37 

49 See R̥gveda 5.41.1 for the context of the phrase paśuṣo na vājān. 

50 The derivation of preyān discussed under vt. 16 on 6.4.22 ā bhād iti ced  vasusamprasāraṇayalopaprasthādīnāṁ pratiṣedhaḥ (Mbh III.193.17) also involves the same problem.  Extending the jurisdiction of 6.4.22 all the way up to the end of 6.4 produces undesirable results, to deal  with which Kātyāyana has composed vt. 16.  

51 3.1.26 hetumati ca.

196 

7.2.116 ata upadhāyāḥ: same as above. 

7.1.37 samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap: in a compound, the first member of which is not naÑ, the  affix Ktvā in the second member of the compound is replaced with LyaP. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.37 and get: praśam + ṆiC + LyaP.  Here the following rules are applicable: 

praś a m + ṆiC + LyaP 

 7.2.116 6.4.56 

7.2.116 ata upadhāyāḥ: same as above.  

6.4.56 lyapi laghupūrvāt52: Ṇi, when occurring after a sound segment which is preceded by a  laghu ‘light’ vowel, is replaced with ay, provided the ārdhadhātuka affix LyaP follows. 

By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.56 and get praśam + ay + LyaP.  Here, 7.2.116 ata upadhāyāḥ applies and we get praśām + ay + LyaP. At this stage, 6.4.92  mitām hrasvaḥ applies, which teaches that the penultimate vowel of a base marked with M (in  the Dhātupāṭha), is replaced with its short counterpart when affix Ṇi follows. But here, praśām 

is not followed by ṆiC but instead by ay. Then how can 6.4.92 apply? 6.4.92 considers 6.4.56  to be asiddhavat, and thus cannot see the outcome of the latter’s application: it sees praśām +  ay + LyaP as praśām + ṆiC + LyaP, and thus applies, giving us the correct form, praśamayya. 

Owing to a relevant vārttika (vt. 13 on 6.4.22) which we will discuss soon, it becomes clear  that Kātyāyana, when trying to derive praśamayya, applies some of these rules in a different  order: first, 7.2.116 ata upadhāyāḥ, second, 6.4.92 mitāṁ hrasvaḥ and third 6.4.56 lyapi  

52 “Lyapi laghupūrvāt originally was lyapi laghupūrvasya. The substitution of the Ablative for the  Genitive case has been suggested by Kātyāyana (Vol. III. p. 204).” See Kielhorn (1887: 178-184) – reprinted in Staal’s ‘A Reader on the Sanskrit Grammarians’ (1972: 121). The original version, lyapi  laghupūrvasya, teaches that ‘Ṇi, when preceded by a light vowel, is replaced with ay, provided the  ārdhadhātuka affix LyaP follows.’ In praśam + ṆiC + LyaP, even though there is a light vowel (a of  śam) to the left of Ṇi, note that Ṇi is not immediately preceded by a (there is m between a and Ṇi). To  lend greater clarity to this rule, Kātyāyana decided to edit it (vt. 1: lyapi laghupūrvasyeti ced vyañjanānteṣūpasaṁkhyānam; vt. 3: lyapi laghupūrvād iti vacanāt siddham). Since we are discussing  an example based on Kātyāyana’s vārttika 13 on 6.4.22 here, I have presented his version in the main  text, rather than the original one.

197 

laghupūrvāt. Let us apply these three rules as per Kātyāyana’s order to understand the problem  faced by him: praśam + ṆiC + LyaP 🡪 praśām + ṆiC + LyaP (7.2.116 ata upadhāyāḥ) 🡪 praśam + ṆiC + LyaP (6.4.92 mitāṁ hrasvaḥ) 🡪 praśamayya (6.4.56 lyapi laghupūrvāt).  

But applying rules in this order is against what Pāṇini has taught in 6.4.22. Let me explain how. 6.4.56 is applicable to ṆiC when it is preceded by a sound (m of praśam) which is in turn  preceded by a light vowel (the penultimate sound a of praśam). But the light vowel a is the  outcome of the application of 6.4.92, which, as per 6.4.22, should be considered asiddhavat with respect to 6.4.56. So, in this derivation, if we are to follow 6.4.22, 6.4.56 should not apply  after the application of 6.4.92.  

To ensure that the correct form praśamayya is derived, Kātyāyana formulates vt. 1353, which  basically goes against 6.4.22: hrasvayalopāllopaś cāyādeśe lyapi ‘a short vowel (here, taught  by 6.4.92), y-deletion and ā-deletion [should not be suspended] when ay-substitution before  LyaP (here, taught by 6.4.56) [can take place]’. 

On the contrary, by following my interpretation of 1.4.2, we get the correct answer without  violating 6.4.22. This provides further proof that my interpretation of 1.4.2 is indeed correct.  

In this chapter, I have discussed my opinion about the exact meanings of the three suspension  rules, the difference between asiddha and asiddhavat, how these suspension rules impact SOI  and DOI, how they interact with 1.4.2, and how my interpretations enable us to perform various  kinds of derivations without having to rely on Kātyāyana’s vārttikas. I do not claim to have  solved every problem associated with the three suspension rules, nor do I claim to have  discussed each kind of example associated with these three rules. To the extent possible, I have  attempted to display the diversity of derivational examples impacted by the suspension rules.  

Modern scholars, such as Bronkhorst (1980), Joshi (1982), Joshi and Roodbergen (1987), and  Yagi (1992) have published papers on the three suspension rules. Some of their opinions are  similar to mine, and others considerably different. However, in the interest of clarity, I have  restricted the discussions in this chapter to a limited set of traditional opinions and my own  opinion on this topic, without examining the opinions of modern scholars.

## 
Chapter Six 

In this concluding chapter, I will discuss the thought process that might have led Pāṇini to  construct his algorithm for dealing with Same Step Rule Interaction (henceforth SSRI), how  this algorithm was interpreted by traditional and modern scholars, and finally how we can use  the knowledge of the correct meaning of 1.4.2 to conduct further research in Pāṇinian studies  and allied disciplines. In essence, I will examine the past, present and future of Pāṇinian  studies, with a special focus on the role played by SSRI in the functioning of the Pāṇinian  machine. Since the goal of this chapter is merely to summarize the timeline of Pāṇinian  thought, I will keep my arguments brief and will focus on the bigger picture, delving only  into those details that are of immediate relevance. 

### 6.1 How and Why Pāṇini Composed 1.4.2 

Having thrown light on the meaning of 1.4.2 in the previous chapters, I will now try to  reconstruct how Pāṇini must have designed his system and, more pertinently, how he must  have come up with what is arguably one of his most important rules – 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe  paraṁ kāryam. It must be borne in mind that this is a purely speculative endeavour.  Nonetheless, since it stands on the foundation of the evidence provided in previous chapters,  and since it helps one gain a better understanding of the functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, I think  it is worthwhile to engage in such speculation. 

Let us use nominal inflection as our example here, and the form devaiḥ (‘God’ masculine,  instrumental plural) as our pivot for this discussion. We know that Pāṇini wanted to derive  not only devaiḥ, but also other forms such as devāt (ablative singular), deveṣu (locative  plural) etc.

To derive the aforementioned forms, Pāṇini came up with one common base to which he  could add different affixes. As traditional grammarians have correctly pointed out, Pāṇini  attributed great value to lāghava ‘brevity’, and thus he wanted to create the base in such a  way that he would have to make the least number of changes to it. In other words, he wanted  to write as few rules as possible. From the paradigm presented above, we can see that the  candidates for the position of the common base were dev, deva, deve, devai, devā, devay etc.  After taking into account several other inflected forms, Pāṇini concluded that it would be  convenient and optimal to choose deva as the base and then to convert it, where required, to  deve, devai, devā, devāy etc. using guṇa, vowel sandhi, substitution etc. Thus, he chose deva as the common base for deriving forms like devasya, devāya, devayoḥ, deve etc.

Secondly, Pāṇini wanted to derive not only devaiḥ but also instrumental plural forms of bases  ending in other sounds and / or of other genders, such as mālābhiḥ (‘garland’ feminine,  ending in ā, instrumental plural), vāribhiḥ (‘water’ neuter, ending in i, instrumental plural)  etc.  

kavibhiḥ 

	mālābhiḥ 

	marudbhiḥ 

	vanaiḥ

	nadībhiḥ 

	bhānubhiḥ 

	vāribhiḥ 

	devaiḥ

	







He wanted to come up with one common affix each for every case-number combination (e.g.,  one affix for nominative plural, one for dative dual etc.). Given his goal of conciseness, he wanted to create these affixes in such a way that he would need to compose as few rules as  possible to bring about changes in these affixes. So, when he was trying to decide what the  instrumental plural affix should be, he examined all possible instrumental plural forms like  kavibhiḥ, mālābhiḥ, marudbhiḥ, nadībhiḥ, bhānubhiḥ, vāribhiḥ, vanaiḥ, devaiḥ etc. He  realized he had two options: he could have chosen either bhis or ais as the instrumental plural  affix. He noticed that most of these forms end in bhis, and a minority of them end in ais.  Because he wanted to compose as few rules as possible, he chose bhis as the instrumental  plural affix. Consequently, he had to compose only one rule, namely 7.1.9 ato bhisa ais, to 

200deal with the affixation process for instrumental plurals. 7.1.9 teaches the substitution of bhis with ais when bhis is preceded by a nominal base ending in a. 

Using the two processes mentioned above, Pāṇini came up with different classes of nominal  bases, on the basis of the final sound and grammatical gender of the base, and with  declensional affixes, which he has listed in 4.1.2 sv-au-jas-am-auṭ-chaṣ-ṭā-bhyām-bhis-ṅe bhyām-bhyas-ṅasi-bhyām-bhyas-ṅas-os-ām-ṅy-os-sup.

Then, he composed certain rules teaching that the affix should be placed to the right-hand  side of the base (cf. 3.1.1 pratyayaḥ, 3.1.2 paraś ca). But simply juxtaposing the affix with  the base could not always give the correct form. So, what did Pāṇini do to deal with this  problem? Naturally, he wrote rules to prescribe the requisite changes. 

Firstly, Pāṇini wrote rules to substitute certain affixes with other equivalent items (see 7.1.9  discussed above). For example, in deva + Ṅe (dative singular), Ṅe had to be replaced with ya (cf. 7.1.13 ṅer yaḥ1). But *devaya is not the correct form. So, thereafter, Pāṇini had to modify  the nominal base, i.e., replace a of deva with its dīrgha counterpart ā (cf. 7.3.102 supi ca2) to  get the correct form devāya. Pāṇini decided to follow this order for the whole Aṣṭādhyāyī:  first, he substituted the affix if required, and second, he modified the base (or both base and  affix together, in case of ekādeśa) if required.  

Sometimes, only affix substitution was required, and base modification was not required. For  example, consider deva + Ṅas (genitive singular). Here, Pāṇini simply had to replace Ṅas  

1 The affix Ṅe, when occurring after a base ending in a, is replaced with ya. 

2 The a at the end of a nominal base is replaced with its long equivalent when followed by a  declensional affix starting with yaÑ (y, v, r l, jh, bh or any nasal).

201 

with sya (cf. 7.1.12 ṭāṅasiṅasām inātsyāḥ3) to get the correct form devasya. On the other  hand, in some other cases, only base modification was required, and affix substitution was  not required. For example, consider deva + bhyām (instrumental-dative-ablative dual). Here,  Pāṇini simply had to replace a of deva with its long counterpart (cf. 7.3.102 supi ca4) to get  the correct form devābhyām. Similarly, consider deva + bhyas (dative-ablative plural). Here,  Pāṇini simply had to replace a of deva with e (cf. 7.3.103 bahuvacane jhaly et5) to get the  correct form devebhyaḥ. But regardless of the situation, Pāṇini always followed the same  order: first, he substituted the affix if required, and then he modified the base (or both base  and affix together, in case of ekādeśa) if required. 

Now, consider deva + bhis (instrumental plural). Here too, first Pāṇini substituted the affix  bhis with ais (cf. 7.1.9 ato bhisa ais), and then, in deva + ais, modified both base and affix by  performing an ekādeśa operation i.e., by replacing a + ai with ai (cf. 6.1.88 vr̥ddhir eci6).  This led to the correct form devaiḥ. However, he realized that students using his grammar  may encounter a hurdle when deriving the form devaiḥ. He noticed that at the step deva +  bhis, 7.1.9 ato bhisa ais is not the only rule applicable: 7.3.102 supi ca and 7.3.103  bahuvacane jhaly et, which he had composed to derive the forms devābhyām and devebhyaḥ 

respectively, are also applicable.  

deva + bhis 

 7.3.102 7.3.103 7.1.9 

When multiple rules became simultaneously applicable, he decided to call the competition  between the rule(s) applicable to the LHS operand and the rule(s) applicable to the RHS  operand, vipratiṣedha ‘mutual opposition’. As we have seen above, Pāṇini’s goal was to  replace the affix first, where required, and only then to modify the base (or modify both base  and affix together, in case of ekādeśa) where required. So, despite the applicability of the  

3 The affix Ṭā, ṄasI and Ṅas, when occurring after a base ending in a, are replaced with ina, āt and  sya respectively. 

4 The a at the end of a nominal base is replaced with its long equivalent when a yaÑ-initial  declensional affix follows. 

5 The a at the end of a nominal base is replaced with e when a plural declensional affix starting with  jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative) follows. 

6 Vr̥ddhi (ā, ai, au) replaces both a and the eC vowel (e, o, ai, au) immediately following it.

202 

LHS rules 7.3.102 and 7.3.103 at this step, Pāṇini wanted the RHS rule 7.1.9, and not any of  these two LHS rules, to apply at this step. Thus, he stated 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam “in the event of vipratiṣedha ‘mutual opposition’ (i.e., DOI), the para kārya ‘RHS operation’  takes place”. Upon applying 7.1.9, we get deva + ais, and rules like 7.3.102 supi ca and  7.3.103 bahuvacane jhaly et are no longer applicable. Here, the rule 6.1.88 vr̥ddhir eci applies, giving the correct form, devaiḥ.  

One pertinent question that merits our attention here is: while making changes, why does  Pāṇini start from the right-hand side (i.e., the affix) and then move leftwards (i.e., towards the  interface between the affix and the base)? Notice that, in the forms devaiḥ, devasya,  devānām, deveṣu etc., dev, which we can call the ‘LHS part’, is common to all the forms. So,  the LHS part does not need to undergo any modification whatsoever. But one may ask, why  not first make changes in the middle i.e., at the interface between base and affix and then  move rightwards to make changes in the affix? This would be counterproductive, because the  changes at the base-affix interface depend on the phonological composition of the affix. For  these reasons, when making modifications, it is optimal for Pāṇini to start from the right end  and move leftwards. 

Pāṇini used this SSRI resolution mechanism not only for nominal inflection, but for other  kinds of derivations too – such as verbal inflection, primary and secondary derivatives, compounds etc. While in the examples of DOI discussed above, the two rules are applicable  to two different items i.e., one to the base and the other to the affix, Pāṇini built his system in  such a way that he could extend the application of 1.4.2 to those cases of DOI wherein both  rules are applicable to two different parts of the same item. 

Where required, he also composed other rules to deal with DOI. For example, he composed  rules 1.4.13 yasmāt pratyayavidhis tadādi pratyaye’ṅgam and 6.4.1 aṅgasya to correctly  derive forms like edhante, dadhati etc. I have discussed this in detail in sections 4.1 and 4.2, chapter 4. He also composed rules like 6.4.22 asiddhavad atrābhāt and 8.2.1  pūrvatrāsiddham to counter the impact of 1.4.2 on DOI. I have discussed this in detail in  chapter 5. Lastly, note that Pāṇini did not compose any rules to deal with SOI. He expected  us to choose the more specific rule, as I have shown in detail in examples 1 and 2 of section  2.8, chapter 2. 

Now that we have discussed how Pāṇini must have come up with 1.4.2, let us examine how  the tradition interpreted 1.4.2.

203 

### 6.2 A Summary of Post-Pāṇinian Ideas on 1.4.2 

Through Kātyāyana’s vārttikas, we know that he interprets para in 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam as ‘the rule which comes later in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial order’. For example,  consider 3.1.67 sārvadhātuke yak which teaches that affix yaK occurs after a verbal root  when a sārvadhātuka affix which denotes bhāva or karman follows. Consider vt. 47 on this  rule: vipratiṣedhād dhi śapo balīyastvam ‘Given the vipratiṣedha8 [between yaK (cf. 3.1.67  sārvadhātuke yak) and ŚaP (cf. 3.1.68 kartari śap)], ŚaP is more powerful [and wins,  because it is para i.e., taught later in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī].’  

Note that this vārttika makes an incorrect statement. There is no conflict at all here: yaK is  added to verbal roots followed by sārvadhātuka affixes denoting bhāva ‘action’ or karman  ‘object’ whereas ŚaP is added when the sārvadhātuka affix denotes kartr̥ ‘agent’. In fact, we  come across many such errors in Kātyāyana’s vārttikas.  

But I think that it is unwarranted to look for ‘correct’ statements in the vārttikas. This is  because, in my opinion, Kātyāyana’s vārttikas are often a medium for him to share all kinds  of thoughts with fellow grammarians – not just the ‘correct’ ones. Very often, we find him  use na vā ‘or rather not’ and ca ‘and’ in a series of consecutive vārttikas to discuss alternative  or even contradicting possibilities and explanations. Let me give an example relevant to the  topic of rule conflict. Consider vts. 3, 4 and 5 on 7.1.6 śīṅo ruṭ9 (Mbh III.243.12-21). 

Vt. 3 jhādeśād āḍ leṭi 

‘[It must be stated that, contrary to 1.4.2, the introduction of] āṬ, [which is taught by the pūrva rule 3.4.94 leṭo’ḍāṭau10 wins against] the substitution of jh [which is taught by the para rule 7.1.5 ātmanepadeṣv anataḥ11].’ 

7 Mbh II.59.1. 

8 I will translate and discuss vipratiṣedha later in this chapter from Kātyāyana’s perspective. 9 An aT which replaces a jh which is the initial sound of an affix preceded by śīṄ, takes the augment  rUṬ. 

10 Augments aṬ and āṬ are introduced, in turn (paryāyeṇa), to affixes which replace LEṬ. 11 A jh which is the initial sound of an ātmanepada affix preceded by a verbal base that does not end  in a is replaced with at.

204 

Vt. 4 na vā nityatvād āṭaḥ 

‘Or rather [this does] not [need to be stated] because [the rule teaching] āṬ is nitya [and thus  defeats the other rule which is anitya].’ 

Vt. 5 antaraṅgalakṣaṇatvāc ca 

‘And [also] because [the rule teaching] āṬ is antaraṅga [and thus defeats the other rule which  is bahiraṅga].’ 

This style of discussing multiple possibilities without striving to always be correct, is very  much akin to Patañjali’s style, which also involves a discussion about the pros and cons of  various perspectives. In both Kātyāyana’s and Patañjali’s work, we find no rigidity or  urgency to establish the truth. Instead, their work is characterized by curiosity and a  willingness to critically examine a motley of ideas.  

Coming back to the topic of para, suffice it to say that regardless of the correctness of its  contents, vt. 4 on 3.1.67, which I have discussed above, buttresses the proposition that  Kātyāyana interpreted para as ‘the rule which comes later in the serial order of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī’. And while this interpretation of para taught by Kātyāyana – alongside tools like  nitya, antaraṅga etc. discussed by him – has been fully endorsed and internalized by the later  tradition, most traditional and modern scholars have almost entirely overlooked a very  important idea about paratva that we find in a vārttika on 6.1.158 anudāttaṁ padam 

ekavarjam. 

6.1.158 teaches that a pada is entirely low-pitched (anudātta) with the exception of one  syllable. But how should we decide which syllable is not low-pitched? Is it a syllable of the  prakr̥ti ‘base’ or a syllable of the pratyaya ‘affix’? After discussing this topic in multiple  vārttikas on this rule, Kātyāyana says, in vt. 1212: śāstraparavipratiṣedhāniyamād vā  śabdaparavipratiṣedhāt siddham ‘[in the event of vipratiṣedha between two operations]  because it has not been [explicitly] mandated that paratva of rules [alone should be used to  resolve] vipratiṣedha, alternatively paratva of sounds [may also be used to] accomplish [the  task of resolving] vipratiṣedha’.13 In other words, here, Kātyāyana suggests that alongside  inferring that the rule that is para i.e., that comes later in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī 

12 Mbh III.100.12. 

13 Here, Nāgeśa, in his Uddyota, refers to another discussion on this subject on 1.1.57 acaḥ parasmin pūrvavidhau by Kaiyaṭa and Nāgeśa.

205 

wins, we may also infer that the operation that is applicable to the para i.e., RHS sound or  group of sounds wins.  

This shows that Kātyāyana was either exposed to or himself thought about the possibility that  para in 1.4.2 could stand for the RHS operation. If he had chosen to further develop this line  of thought, this idea could potentially have reached its logical conclusion, namely the correct  interpretation of para in 1.4.2. One could argue that, by choosing to focus on and  subsequently by accepting the wrong interpretation from amongst the two possible  interpretations of para discussed in the aforementioned vārttika, Kātyāyana completely changed the developmental trajectory of the Pāṇinian tradition. Kātyāyana’s successors too  failed to recognize the sheer potential of this vārttika, and thus the key to the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s  algorithm remained before everyone’s eyes and yet hidden from everyone’s mind.  

One key repercussion of Kātyāyana’s belief that para in 1.4.2 stands for ‘the rule that comes  later in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial order’ must have been that he likely got numerous incorrect  forms at the end of derivations where he solved SSRI using his interpretation of 1.4.2.  Perhaps it is to avoid these undesirable outcomes - wherever possible - that he decided to  reduce the jurisdiction of 1.4.2. For example, in vt. 1 on 1.4.2, he defines vipratiṣedha in a  way that allows him to exclude anavakāśa-sāvakāśa pairs from the jurisdiction of 1.4.2: dvau  prasaṅgāv anyārthāv ekasmin sa vipratiṣedhaḥ (1)14 ‘[When] two rules [which are]  applicable elsewhere [become applicable] to the same place, this [is called] vipratiṣedha’.  Thus, an SSRI between two sāvakāśa rules (i.e., rules which are applicable elsewhere) is  called vipratiṣedha. We know that an SSRI can be either a conflict scenario or a non-conflict  one. But as I have said in previous chapters, Kātyāyana is, for the most part, interested in  conflict. Thus, I will take the liberty, for the sake of this chapter, to translate the traditional  interpretation of vipratiṣedha as ‘conflict between sāvakāśa rules’.  

In vt. 2 on 1.4.2, he says: ekasmin yugapat asaṁbhavāt pūrvaparaprāpter ubhayaprasaṅgaḥ “[Given the] impossibility [of] co-application at one [i.e., the same step, there arises] the  undesirable scenario of both pūrva and para being applicable.” In vt. 5, Kātyāyana says:  apratipattir vobhayos tulyabalatvāt ‘Or [maybe this results in] the failure of both [rules] to  apply because of [their] equal strength’. In vt. 6 he says: tatra pratipattyartham etad vacanam ‘So, this [sūtra] has been formulated in order to instruct us about this [i.e., the decision  regarding which rule should apply]’. From vts. 1, 2, 5 and 6 on 1.4.2, we can conclude that,  

14 Mbh I.304.10-305.3.

206 

according to Kātyāyana, the conflict between two sāvakāśa rules is called vipratiṣedha, and  that these two rules are treated as tulyabala ‘of equal strength’. Note that this is the only  occasion on which Kātyāyana uses the term tulyabala. Patañjali too uses the word tulyabala only once – when commenting on vt. 5 on 1.4.2.15 

Kātyāyana has composed several vārttikas discussing terms like nitya, anitya, antaraṅga,  bahiraṅga, apavāda, utsarga, anavakāśa and sāvakāśa. This indicates that he was familiar  with or himself constructed these concepts and established relationships between nitya and  anitya rules, between antaraṅga and bahiraṅga rules, between apavāda and utsarga rules, 

and between anavakāśa and sāvakāśa rules. While Patañjali does not always agree with  Kātyāyana, he has embraced all these concepts wholeheartedly in his commentary. We get no  evidence of Kātyāyana connecting these concepts directly with tulyabalatva, and only one  piece of evidence of him establishing a direct link between one of these tools and  vipratiṣedha, which is as follows. On 6.1.135 suṭ kāt pūrvaḥ ‘The augment sUṬ is added  before k16’, Kātyāyana says, in vt. 717: avipratiṣedho vā bahiraṅgalakṣaṇatvāt ‘[Alternatively, one can argue that this is] not a case of vipratiṣedha because [sUṬ is]  bahiraṅga’. This shows that he excludes antaraṅga-bahiraṅga pairs from the domain of  1.4.2. 

But even after inventing tools like nitya, antaraṅga, apavāda and anavakāśa, Kātyāyana was  unable to resolve certain conflicts, especially those involving DOI mutual blocking, using any  of the aforementioned tools. On many occasions, solving such conflicts using 1.4.2 too led to  an incorrect answer at the end of the derivation.18 Thus, he wrote the ‘pūrvavipratiṣiddha’ 

vārttikas. By using the expression ‘pūrvavipratiṣiddha’, Kātyāyana points out that instead of  the para sūtra, which should win as per his interpretation of 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam, it is the pūrva sūtra which emerges victorious. We have already looked at some such  vārttikas in chapter 2, so I will simply mention one of them here. On 7.1.96 striyāṁ ca, vt.  1019 reads: guṇavr̥ddhyauttvatr̥jvadbhāvebhyo num pūrvavipratiṣiddham ‘In case of  vipratiṣedha, the pūrva sūtra, which teaches the insertion of the augment nUM, takes  

15 It must be stated though that this passage is reproduced verbatim by Patañjali in his comments on  vt. 3 on 6.1.85 antādivac ca (Mbh III.59.20-60.6). 

16 Note that this is an adhikāra rule. 

17 Mbh III.93.1. 

18 For instance, see example 5 of section 2.7, chapter 2. 

19 Mbh III.275.23.

207 

precedence over para sūtras which teach (i) guṇa, (ii) vr̥ddhi, (iii) auttva, (iv) tr̥jvadbhāva’. By writing this and other pūrvavipratiṣiddha vārttikas, Kātyāyana draws attention to the  perceived failures of / loopholes in / exceptions to the rule 1.4.2. 

Commenting on most pūrvavipratiṣiddha vārttikas, Patañjali says that they are not required at  all. He gives various reasons for this, of which the following one is used by him on multiple  occasions. On vt. 10 on 7.1.96 stated above, he says: na vaktavyaḥ. iṣṭavācī paraśabdaḥ.  vipratiṣedhe paraṁ yad iṣṭaṁ tad bhavati ‘[This] should not be said. The word para means  desirable. In [the event of] vipratiṣedha, the para i.e., desirable [rule] applies.’ It is evident  that in this context Patañjali tries to defend 1.4.2 against Kātyāyana’s criticism. In fact, this is  anything but an isolated instance: scholars like Goldstücker (1861: 119-121) and Weber  (1872: 297-298) were amongst the earliest modern scholars to argue that Kātyāyana was  severely critical of Pāṇini’s sūtras, and that Patañjali invested significant effort in countering such negative remarks. While many scholars, starting with Kielhorn, have presented rebuttals  to this, even Kielhorn (1876: 50) cannot deny “that Patañjali has refuted some of the (i.e.,  Kātyāyana’s)20 objections, that he has rejected some of the additional rules of Kātyāyana.”  

Coming back to vt. 10 on 7.1.96, I would argue that by hurrying to dismiss Kātyāyana’s  pūrvavipratiṣiddha vārttikas using a rather feeble argument, namely that para means iṣṭa,  Patañjali missed the opportunity to discover the truth of 1.4.2. Instead, if he had accepted  Kātyāyana’s statement as valid and had pondered over the cause of this phenomenon, he  could possibly have realized that Kātyāyana’s interpretation of para itself was incorrect, and  that it was this misinterpretation which had led him to write the pūrvavipratiṣiddha vārttikas.  This would certainly have been a far superior defence of Pāṇini’s rule 1.4.2 against  Kātyāyana’s criticism than the one mounted by Patañjali.  

After the composition of the Mahābhāṣya, ideas about the terms vipratiṣedha, para,  tulyabala, and the various tools of conflict resolution discussed above began to take more  concrete shape. Direct links and relationships between these concepts came to be established.  For example, on 1.4.2, the Kāśikā, which was written in the 7th century AD, says:  

yatra dvau prasaṅgāv anyārthāv ekasmin yugapat prāpnutaḥ sa tulyabalavirodho  vipratiṣedhaḥ. tasmin vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryaṁ bhavati.  

20 The contents in round brackets have been added by me to Kielhorn’s quote.

208 

utsargāpavādanityānityāntaraṅgabahiraṅgeṣu tulyabalatā nāstīti nāyam asya yogasya  viṣayaḥ, balavataiva tatra bhavitavyam.  

‘When two operations which can be applied at other sites become simultaneously applicable  at one [and the same site], this is called a conflict of equal strength or vipratiṣedha. In the  event of vipratiṣedha, the rule that comes later [in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī] prevails.  A general rule (utsarga) and its exception (apavāda), or a nitya rule and an anitya rule, or an  antaraṅga and a bahiraṅga rule, are not rules of equal strength. These pairs do not fall under  the jurisdiction of this rule. In these cases, the stronger rule wins.’ 

Notice that, unlike Kātyāyana and Patañjali, the authors of the Kāśikā explicitly exclude  nitya-anitya, antaraṅga-bahiraṅga and apavāda-utsarga pairs from the ambit of vipratiṣedha by calling them ‘not tulyabala’. Thereafter, in both Pāṇinian and non-Pāṇinian paribhāṣā literature, we find multiple versions of the same paribhāṣā which compares the ‘strengths’ of  the tools mentioned above. The earliest Pāṇinian paribhāṣā treatise to include it is the  Paribhāṣāpāṭha of Puruṣottamadeva written in the 12th century. It reads:  pūrvaparanityāntaraṅgāpavādānām uttarottaraṁ balīyaḥ (Pbh. 39). ‘Of [these five kinds of  rules, - viz.] a preceding [rule], a subsequent [rule], a nitya [rule], an antaraṅga [rule], and an  apavāda [rule], - each following [rule] possesses greater force [than any one of, or all, the  rules which are mentioned before it].’21 

In sum, the relationships between tulyabala, vipratiṣedha, nitya, antaraṅga, para, apavāda etc. were fully and concretely established by the twelfth century. Alongside the paribhāṣās  teaching these tools, dozens of paribhāṣās teaching exceptions to these tools were also  written by the paribhāṣākāras. On this account, given its unwieldy and complicated nature,  the traditional solution completely fails the Occam’s razor test. Additionally, the flexibility of  ideas, free thinking, willingness to consider a wide variety of possibilities and alternatives,  which, as stated earlier, are so characteristic of the early tradition i.e., Kātyāyana’s and  Patañjali’s work, came to be replaced by a willing acceptance of rigid, ossified, established  and widely-accepted ‘facts’ and ‘truths’ in the later tradition – in particular, in paribhāṣā 

literature. It is noteworthy that many of these paribhāṣās are anitya ‘not always applicable’  by the tradition’s own admission!  

21 Abhyankar (ed.) 1967: 160a.

209 

Here, one may ask: why do the Kāśikā and the paribhāṣā texts not question the correctness of  Kātyāyana’s interpretation of the term para in 1.4.2? I think the first broad reason is that,  along with Pāṇini, who composed the foundational treatise of the tradition, Kātyāyana and  Patañjali too came to be worshipped in the tradition, which might have made it almost  unthinkable for subsequent scholars to disagree with Kātyāyana or Patañjali over such  fundamental aspects of the grammar as the meaning of para in 1.4.222. It must be noted that  even though the Kāśikā does present an alternative viewpoint to that of the Mahābhāṣya on  many occasions, it completely embraces Patañjali’s ideas on this subject. Secondly, even  amongst the three munis, Patañjali’s word superseded Kātyāyana’s and Kātyāyana’s word  superseded Pāṇini’s, right from the time of Kaiyaṭa, who famously stated: yathottaraṁ hi  munitrayasya prāmāṇyam23 ‘Among the three munis, the authority of later muni supersedes  that of his predecessor(s)’24. Thus, Patañjali became the most important person in the  tradition, surpassing Pāṇini himself, whose work he had set out to expound on. So,  hypothetically speaking, even if a traditional scholar had discovered that Patañjali had  misinterpreted para in 1.4.2, he would have preferred Patañjali’s interpretation to Pāṇini’s in  all likelihood! 

One would have expected the tradition to start paying ever closer attention to the topic of rule  conflict with the writing of the Kaumudī texts, the main goal of which was to teach students  how to perform derivations. To achieve this goal, the Kaumudī texts took the radical decision  to reorder the rules of the Aṣṭādhyāyī so that a rule would be taught in the Kaumudī only  when it applied at some step in a certain derivation. However, unfortunately, these texts did  not challenge the existing interpretation of para in 1.4.2 and, like previous texts, performed  derivations using the traditional tools for conflict resolution. In fact, not only did the  Kaumudī texts fail to discover the correct meaning of 1.4.2, but they also unwittingly ensured  that coming generations would not decipher the same.  

They did this by shifting the focus of the tradition from the comprehensive functioning of the  Pāṇinian machine to the many individual products of the machine, namely, individual  derivations of various forms. Over time, students of the Kaumudī got so familiar with these  derivations that now, they do not have to and, consequently, do not, stop at most steps of the  

22 Deshpande (1998, 2019) discusses this topic in great detail.  

23 Another popular version of this, also written by Kaiyaṭa is: uttarottaraṁ munīnāṁ prāmāṇyam. 24 See Pradīpa on Mahābhāṣya on 1.1.29.

210derivation to ask themselves: which rules are applicable at this step? Which of these rules  should I apply? And why? And if pupils do apply conflict resolution tools of their own accord and end up getting the wrong form, they are not encouraged by their teachers to ask why.  Instead, they are advised to consult the Kaumudī texts to ‘correct’ themselves i.e., to  memorize the explanation offered by their authors. 

This chain of accepting what previous scholars have said was finally broken by many modern  Indologists, including Houben (2003), who asked if Pāṇini’s grammar is meant to function  like a machine at all25, and Bronkhorst (2004) who questioned the ‘linearity’ of Pāṇinian  derivations.26 Others have tried to make changes in some parts of the traditional conflict  resolution mechanism. For example, multiple scholars, starting with Faddegon (1936), have  advocated restricting the jurisdiction of 1.4.2 to 1.4.2-2.2.38. Cardona (1970: 57-58) has  proposed limited blocking, which essentially deals with more complex cases of SOI, even  though he does not state this explicitly.27 

Joshi and Kiparsky interpret vipratiṣedha as ‘mutual blocking’ and state that “for…so-called  vipratiṣedha, no general solution has been found”28 by them.29 However, they do propose a  solution for those cases which involve unidirectional blocking, namely the siddha principle.  What it essentially does is resort to the nitya principle30 to solve not only these cases which  the tradition solves using nityatva, but also those which it solves using antaraṅgatva. 

Bronkhorst (1984: 310-313) and Cardona (1999: 154-161) have correctly criticized the  reasoning behind this principle.31 

25 I hope I have proven through this thesis that Pāṇini intended for his grammar to function like a  well-oiled machine. But I do not want to deny that he may have made certain mistakes by virtue of  being human or that interpolations and changes occurred in the Aṣṭādhyāyī at the hands of later  scholars. I think these factors certainly had a negative impact on the functioning of Pāṇini’s machine.  

26 See section 1.3, chapter 1 for a detailed discussion on this subject. 

27 For more on this, see example 3 in section 4.4, chapter 4. 

28 Kiparsky 1987: 295. 

29 Kiparsky (1991: 349) also says, “Joshi and I were unable to find any general way to predict which  rule wins in such a situation [i.e., vipratiṣedha, which they interpret as mutual blocking], although  solutions for some special subtypes of vipratiṣedha were suggested.” Note that the words in the  square brackets in this quote have been added by me for the sake of clarity.

31 For my criticism of the same, please see appendix E.

211 

Even though none of these scholars have been able to offer a radically different interpretation  of 1.4.2, their willingness to ask questions, to propose new ideas and to challenge the  traditional method of conflict resolution inspired me to do the same, eventually leading me to the interpretation of 1.4.2 I have presented in this thesis. 

In the following section, I will discuss how my findings can help us better understand other  aspects of the Aṣṭādhyāyī and linguistics in the future. 

### 6.3 The Way Forward 

I have not dealt with rules teaching accentuation in this thesis. However, accentuation is  inseparable from Pāṇinian Sanskrit and thus, I hope to conduct research in the future on  whether we can correctly derive accented forms using my method of tackling SSRI.  Conversely, using my method of dealing with SSRI may enhance our knowledge about how  accentuation actually works in the Pāṇinian system.  

Secondly, I have not explored rules taught particularly for deriving Vedic forms in this thesis.  However, in the future, research on derivations involving such rules may enable us to verify the correctness of my findings about Pāṇini’s SSRI mechanism. It could also assist us in  understanding which parts of Vedic literature Pāṇini was familiar with, thereby adding to the  work done by Thieme (1935), Bronkhorst (1991) and others on this subject. In sum, such  research will improve our understanding of the relationship between Pāṇini and the Vedas. 

Even though the question of whether certain rules were interpolated into the ‘original’  version of Aṣṭādhyāyī32 is not closely connected with the topic of SSRI, we can benefit from  studying these topics together. For example, if we get the incorrect form at the end of a  derivation in which we have resolved the SSRI using my method, then, in the presence of  supporting evidence, we can consider the possibility that the rule in question has been edited  or constitutes an interpolation.33 

While it may seem that anuvr̥tti34 does not directly influence or get influenced by SSRI, there  are some strong links between the two topics. Anuvr̥tti alone helps us understand the exact  

32 For a detailed discussion on this, see Joshi and Roodbergen (1983).  

33 See example 1 of section 3.1, chapter 3 to understand this better.  

34 For detailed studies on anuvr̥tti, see Joshi and Bhate (1983, 1984).

212 

contents of any rule, and without knowing the contents of a rule, we cannot establish whether  it interacts with other rules at the same step. So, developing a sound understanding of anuvr̥tti can help us better appreciate the functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. Also, if we get the incorrect  form at the end of a derivation in which we have resolved the SSRI using my method, then  we can reconsider if the right words have been continued through anuvr̥tti into the rules  involved in SSRI.35 

Now let us look at how my findings about SSRI in the Aṣṭādhyāyī can potentially open up  new avenues of research in certain disciplines related to Pāṇinian studies. Let us start by  talking about Sanskrit computational linguistics36. One of the main goals of this field is to  teach Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī to the computer, so that when we feed the bases, affixes and the 

speaker’s intention37 into the computer, the computer can perform the derivation for us and  give us the correct final form. Understanding how Pāṇini deals with SSRI and knowing the  actual meaning of 1.4.2 will surely help scholars to make progress in achieving this goal. 

My findings can also help develop new ideas for modern theoretical linguistics, and more  specifically, phonology. In Western phonology, Chomsky and Halle (1968) postulated that,  each language has its own fixed order of applying rules in derivations. This is called extrinsic  ordering. Kiparsky (1968), on the other hand, proposed that the order of rule application  could be viewed as being dependent on the formal relationships between rules, namely,  whether one rule feeds or bleeds the other rule.38 This is called intrinsic ordering.  

Pāṇini’s derivations are neither extrinsically nor intrinsically ordered. In fact, one need not  worry about the concept of rule order at all when performing Pāṇinian derivations. This is  because the choice of the rule which should apply at any given step, depends neither on  whether it feeds or bleeds another rule, not on any predetermined order of application.  Instead, this decision is made by the ingenious algorithm devised by Pāṇini to deal with  

35 For instance, consider example 2 of section 3.1, chapter 3.  

36 ‘Sanskrit Computational Linguistics – First and Second International Symposia’ helps one gain a  good understanding about the diversity and scope of the field.  

37 By ‘speaker’s intention’, I mean, information about the exact form he or she wishes to derive. For  example, ‘imperative passive third person singular’.  

38 A feeds B if the application of A facilitates the application of B, and P bleeds Q if the application of  P obstructs the application of Q.

213 

SSRI. Perhaps modern linguistics can overcome the shortcomings of extrinsic and intrinsic  ordering by experimenting with Pāṇini’s model.  

Finally, my work on Pāṇini’s SSRI mechanism can also potentially propel further research on  the topic of ‘natural language complexity’. In computational theory, attempts have been made  to understand how complex a formal language (i.e., an artificial language used in computer  science) is using the Chomskyan hierarchy (based on Chomsky: 1959), which consists of four  different levels of formal language grammars and the ‘machines’ that correspond with them.  Linguists have also tried to situate natural languages in this hierarchy. Let us look at the  hierarchy before we discuss this topic further. 

Language 

	Least powerful  grammar that can  generate it

	Machine equivalent to this  grammar

	Production rule(s)

	recursively  enumerable

	Type 0 

	Turing Machine

	 δ 🡪 θ 

	context 

sensitive

	Type 1 

	Linear Bounded Automaton 

	αΑβ 🡪 αγβ

	context-free 

	Type 2 

	Pushdown Automaton

	 A 🡪 γ

	regular 

	Type 3 

	Finite State Automaton

	 A 🡪 a  

 A 🡪 aB

	







Key: 

a = terminal symbol  

A, B = non-terminal symbol  

α, β, γ, δ, θ = string of symbols39 

39 This information has a purely indicative value but no claim to exhaustiveness. There are some  constraints on some of these strings depending on whether or not they can contain terminals, whether  or not they can be empty etc. but I won’t delve into this because it is not of much importance in the  present context. 

214 

Please read the following three statements carefully in the context of the table presented  above: 

(i) In A 🡪 γ (Type 2), if the string γ contains only one symbol, namely the terminal symbol a,  then this rule can be rewritten as A 🡪 a (Type 3). Similarly, if the string γ contains only two  symbols, namely aB, then this rule can be rewritten as A 🡪 aB (Type 3). These are only two  of many possibilities. Thus, regular grammars (Type 3) constitute a subset of context free  grammars (Type 2). 

(ii) In αΑβ 🡪 αγβ (Type 1), if both α and β are empty, then this rule can be written as A 🡪 γ (Type 2). This is only one of many possibilities. Thus, context free grammars (Type 2)  constitute a subset of context sensitive grammars (Type 1).  

(iii) In δ 🡪 θ (Type 0), if the string δ is αΑβ and if the string θ is αγβ, then this rule can be  rewritten as αΑβ 🡪 αγβ (Type 1). This is only one of many possibilities. Thus, context  sensitive grammars (Type 1) constitute a subset of recursively enumerable grammars (Type  0). 

Therefore, we can represent these grammars as follows: 

Type 0 

Type 1 

Type 2 

Type 3

215 

As can be seen from the diagram above: 

(i) Type 3 grammars can produce Type 3 languages.  

(ii) Type 2 grammars can produce Type 3 and Type 2 languages. 

(iii) Type 1 grammars can produce Type 3, Type 2 and Type 1 languages. (iv) Type 0 grammars can produce Type 3, Type 2, Type 1 and Type 0 languages. 

Note that in terms of productive power, the grammars can be compared as follows (where G1 > G2 stands for ‘G1 is more powerful than G2’): 

Type 0 > Type 1 > Type 2 > Type 3 

As stated above, even though this hierarchy is primarily meant for formal languages, linguists  have attempted to situate natural languages within it. They have shown that Dutch (Bresnan  et al 1982), Swiss German (Shieber 1985) and Bambara (Culy 1985) are neither regular  (Type 3) nor context free (Type 2). Scholars like Fowler (1965), Staal (1965, 1966), Hyman  (2007), Penn and Kiparsky (2012) and Lowe (in press) have discussed the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s  computational ability, the characteristics of the language it produces, and whether and how  we can situate such a language, i.e., Pāṇinian Sanskrit, in the Chomskyan hierarchy. 

I think that there are several loopholes in the thesis that we can meaningfully situate natural  languages – which are significantly different in their nature, composition and purpose, from  formal languages – in a hierarchy meant for formal languages. However, the outcome of my  research has an interesting parallel with one aspect of the Chomskyan hierarchy which I think  merits further exploration. The following diagram illustrates how a Pāṇinian derivation would  look in the absence of Pāṇini’s algorithm for dealing with SSRI. Let us assume, for the sake  of this discussion, that two rules are applicable at every step of the derivation. The derivation  starts at State 1 and the correct final form is State 4h.

216 

State 1 

State 2a State 2b 

State 3a State 3b State 3c State 3d 

State 4a State 4b State 4c State 4d State 4e State 4f State 4g State 4h 

This is a three-step derivation. Step 1 takes us from state 1 to state 2, step 2 from state 2 to  state 3, and lastly step 3 from state 3 to state 4. To reach state 4h one has to make three  correct decisions: one has to choose state 2b in step 1, state 3d in step 2, and state 4h in step  3. But if there had existed no internal algorithm in Pāṇini’s machine, one could have ended 

up with any of the eight final answers (cf. state 4), and the probability of getting the correct  answer would have been be 1/8. However, by teaching his solution for SSRI, Pāṇini has  converted the above machine into the following machine: 

State 1 State 2b State 3d State 4h

To borrow terms from computational theory, Pāṇini has converted his ‘non-deterministic  machine’, which could potentially proceed along multiple derivational paths, into a  deterministic one, which proceeds along a single path dictated by the algorithm. A  deterministic machine is desirable because it produces only correct forms whereas a non 

deterministic machine is not desirable because it produces both correct and incorrect forms. Penn and Kiparsky (2012) say: “through the lens of contemporary NLP40, the most amazing  fact about the Aṣṭādhyāyī is not that it produces so many correct derivations, after all, but that  it simultaneously avoids so many incorrect ones.” 

40 Natural Language Processing. 

217 

Now let us use this information to situate Pāṇinian Sanskrit in this hierarchy. We already  know that we find rules which resemble context sensitive rules (cf. αΑβ 🡪 αγβ) in Pāṇini’s  grammar. Since regular (Type 3) and context free (Type 2) grammars do not contain such  rules, we can infer that Pāṇini’s grammar is neither regular nor context-free. But does the  presence of context-sensitive rules make Pāṇini’s grammar context sensitive (Type 1)?  Context-sensitive grammars in the Chomskyan hierarchy correspond with non-deterministic  linear bounded automata. But as I said, Pāṇini’s grammar is deterministic. Thus, we cannot  call the Aṣṭādhyāyī a Type 1 (context sensitive) grammar. What kind of grammar is the  Aṣṭādhyāyī then? I trust that scholars will be able to answer this question in the future with  the help of the information I have provided above. 

In sum, I am confident that my findings about Pāṇini’s algorithm for regulating SSRI will  enable us to make substantial advances not only in the field of Pāṇinian studies but also in  multiple allied disciplines. pāṇinaye namaḥ!

## Appendix
### A: Some Pāṇinian Metarules on Substitution 

Introduction 

In this thesis, we have focused on vidhi sūtras ‘operational rules’, and to be precise, on how  we choose one rule from amongst the two or more operational rules which are simultaneously  applicable in a derivation. While operational rules play an important, perhaps central role in  Pāṇinian derivations, they cannot be correctly interpreted or applied without the help of two  other categories of rules, namely saṁjñā sūtras ‘definition rules’ and paribhāṣā sūtras 

‘metarules’. 

We have already observed how the more specific rule wins in case of competition between  saṁjñā rules, in section 1.6, chapter 1. In appendices A and B, we will look at some cases of  competition between paribhāṣā rules which the tradition has failed to solve satisfactorily.  Pāṇini has not given any explicit instructions about which of the two competing paribhāṣā 

rules must be chosen. In keeping with the general-exception template that pervades the entire  Aṣṭādhyāyī, I think that the more specific rule emerges victorious in cases of competition  between paribhāṣā rules. 

Competition Between Paribhāṣā Rules 1.1.52-1.1.55 

In order to examine an example of competition between these paribhāṣā rules, let us derive the  imperative third-person singular form of the root likh ‘to write’. I will not discuss DOI and SOI  here since our focus is on metarules. Nonetheless, I will perform the derivation bearing in mind  my method of solving SOI and DOI: likh + LOṬ (3.3.162 loṭ ca) 🡪 likh + tiP (3.4.77 lasya,  3.4.78 tip-tas-jhi…1) 🡪 likh + tu (3.4.86 er uḥ) 🡪 likh + ŚaP + tu (3.1.68 kartari śap). Since  likh + ŚaP cannot undergo any other operations which are not triggered by tu, we can write  likh + ŚaP as likha. likha is an aṅga with respect to tu. Thus, we can apply 7.1.35 tuhyostātaṅ 

āśiṣy anyatarasyām here. This rule teaches that tu and hi should be replaced with tātAṄ in a  benedictive form. If this rule is applied, which part of tu does tātAṄ replace? To get the correct  answer, likhatāt, tātAṄ needs to replace tu entirely. But what do the relevant metarules have to  say in this regard? Do they help us derive the correct answer, likhatāt? Let us look at them: 

1 The full sūtra reads: tip-tas-jhi-sip-thas-tha-mip-vas-mas-t(a)-ātām-jha-thās-āthām-dhvam-iḍ-vahi mahiṅ. 

219 

1.1.52 alo’ntyasya: a substitute replaces the final sound of the item for which it is taught. 

1.1.53 ṅic ca (alaḥ antyasya): a Ṅ-marked substitute replaces the final sound of the item for  which it is taught.  

1.1.54 ādeḥ parasya (alaḥ): a substitute taught for the following item replaces its first sound. 

1.1.55 anekālśit sarvasya: a multi-sound substitute or a substitute marked with Ś replaces the  entirety of the item for which it is taught. 

Before we go further, I should clarify the traditional interpretation of 1.1.54 ādeḥ parasya.  According to the tradition, the metarule 1.1.54 governs only those rules which follow the  following template: the substitute B1 is taught for B when B is preceded by A (where A is  mentioned in the ablative). The Kāśikā says: parasya kāryaṁ śiṣyamāṇam āder alaḥ 

pratyetavyam. kva ca parasya kāryaṁ śiṣyate. yatra pañcamīnirdeśaḥ. ‘An operation taught  for the following item will apply to the first sound (of the following item). And where (i.e., in  which cases) is the operation taught for the following sound? Where [an item has been]  mentioned in the ablative.’ It also gives an example: 6.3.97 dvyantarupasargebhyo ’pa īt ‘the  substitute īT is taught for [the nominal base] ap ‘water’ when ap is preceded by dvi, antar or  an upasarga ‘preverb’. Since dvyantarupasargebhyo is taught in the ablative, 1.1.54 mandates  that īT replaces the first sound of ap i.e., a. In sum, the Kāśikā implies that 1.1.54 does not  govern rules in which the preceding term is not mentioned in the ablative. 

The Siddhāntakaumudī (SK) mentions the following relationships between these metarules: (i) 1.1.54 ādeḥ parasya is an exception of 1.1.52 alo’ntyasya. Thus 1.1.54 wins against 1.1.52.2 

(ii) 1.1.55 anekālśit sarvasya is an exception of 1.1.52 alo’ntyasya. Thus 1.1.55 wins against  1.1.52.3 

(iii) 1.1.53 ṅic ca is an exception of 1.1.55 anekālśit sarvasya. Thus 1.1.53 wins against 1.1.55.4 

(iv) 1.1.55 anekālśit sarvasya comes after 1.1.54 ādeḥ parasya in the serial order of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī. Thus, by the traditional interpretation of 1.4.2, 1.1.55 wins against 1.1.54.5 

2Alo’ntyasya ity asyāpavādaḥ (SK on 1.1.54). 

3 Alo’ntyasūtrāpavādaḥ (SK on 1.1.55). 

4 Sarvasya ity asyāpavādaḥ (SK on 1.1.53). 

5 Aṣṭābhya auś (7.1.21) ityādau deḥ parasya ity etad api paratvād anena bādhyate (SK on 1.1.55).

220Below, I have represented this information in the form of a diagram. The arrows point towards  the winning rules. 

1.1.52  

1.1.54 

1.1.55 

  

1.1.53

Let us go back to the rule 7.1.35 tuhyos tātaṅ āśiṣy anyatarasyām. It teaches the substitute  tātAṄ for tu. The metarules eligible to govern the application of 7.1.35 are 1.1.52, 1.1.53 and  1.1.55. 1.1.55 is an exception of 1.1.52 and 1.1.53 is an exception of 1.1.55. Thus, 1.1.53 should  govern the application of 7.1.35, which leads to tātAṄ replacing only the final sound of tu.  However, this gives the incorrect form *likhattāt. In his only vārttika on 1.1.536, Kātyāyana  recognizes this problem and says that the operation concerning tātAṄ should not be governed  by 1.1.53 ṅic ca because here the only purpose of anubandha Ṅ is to block any potential guṇa 

or vr̥ddhi substitution in the preceding base (cf. 1.1.5 kṅiti ca), rather than facilitate the  substitution of the last sound (cf. 1.1.53). However, we know that, in Pāṇini’s grammar, if a  certain item is marked with Ṅ, then it automatically possesses all the properties associated with  Ṅ-marking, unless Pāṇini has said something to the opposite effect. One cannot arbitrarily  choose which function of Ṅ is relevant to a particular rule and which function is not. Thus,  Kātyāyana’s explanation is not acceptable.  

Is there a way to derive the correct form likhatāt without flouting Pāṇini’s metarules? To  answer this question, let me discuss this problem from my perspective. To begin with, let me 

6 Tātaṅi ṅitkaraṇasya sāvakāśatvād vipratiṣedhāt sarvādeśaḥ (1) ‘Because the Ṅ of tātAṄ is sāvakāśa ‘useful elsewhere’ [we can infer that] there is a vipratiṣedha ‘conflict’ (between 1.1.55 anekālśit  sarvasya and 1.1.53 ṅic ca) [and thus, the para rule, which teaches] sarvādeśa, [wins]’ (Mbh I.131.1). 

221 

present my interpretation of 1.1.54 ādeḥ parasya, which is different from that of the tradition.  I think that there is no evidence in the wording of 1.1.54 or elsewhere to suggest that the  presence of an ablative form in an operational rule constitutes a necessary condition for the  application of 1.1.54. So, according to me, 1.1.54 governs any para or right-hand side (RHS)  operation.  

Let us look at the implications of these two interpretations of 1.1.54. According to the  traditional interpretation, since an ablative form is not present in 7.1.35 tuhyos tātaṅ āśiṣy  anyatarasyām, 1.1.54 would not be able to govern it. However, according to my interpretation,  1.1.54 is eligible to govern 7.1.35 simply because the operand tu is para i.e., placed to the right 

hand side of likha.  

I also disagree with the tradition with respect to the scope of 1.1.52 alo’ntyasya and 1.1.53 ṅic  ca. According to the tradition, 1.1.53 is applicable to any substitute marked with Ṅ. However,  I think that, since Pāṇini has specifically taught 1.1.54 for RHS substitutions, he has likely  taught both 1.1.52 and 1.1.53 only for LHS substitutions. I agree with the tradition on the scope  of 1.1.55: I think that Pāṇini has taught 1.1.55 for both LHS and RHS substitutions. Let us now  establish general-exception relationships separately for LHS and RHS substitutions.  

First, let us consider LHS substitutions, which can potentially be governed by 1.1.52, 1.1.53  and 1.1.55.  

(i) While 1.1.55 anekālśit sarvasya can govern only those substitutes which contain multiple  sound segments or are marked with Ś, 1.1.52 alo’ntyasya can govern any substitute. Thus,  1.1.55 is an exception of 1.1.52. 

(ii) In case of substitutes which are made up of multiple sounds and marked with Ṅ, there arises  competition between 1.1.53 ṅic ca and 1.1.55 anekālśit sarvasya. I think the only reason behind  teaching a rule (i.e., 1.1.53) specially dealing with Ṅ-marked substitutes is to suggest that Ṅ marked substitutes, despite containing multiple sounds, replace only the final sound of the  operand, and not the entirety of it. Thus, I think 1.1.53 is an exception of 1.1.55.  

Now let us consider RHS substitutions, which can potentially be governed by 1.1.54 and 1.1.55.  Since 1.1.55 has been specifically taught for substitutes made up of multiple sounds, it is an  exception of 1.1.54.  

This information can be diagrammatically represented as follows. The arrows point towards  the exception / specific rule:

222 

LHS substitution 

	RHS substitution

	1.1.52  

1.1.55 

1.1.53

	1.1.54 

1.1.55

	







Thus, we can conclude that 7.1.35, which deals with an RHS substitute, i.e., tātAṄ, cannot be  governed by 1.1.52 and 1.1.53, which have been taught only for LHS substitutions. The only  rules that can potentially govern 7.1.35 are 1.1.54 and 1.1.55. Since 1.1.55 has been specifically  taught for substitutes made up of multiple sounds, it is more specific than 1.1.54. Therefore, 

by 1.1.55, tu is entirely replaced with tātAṄ, giving the correct form likhatāt. 

223 

### B: 1.1.66 and 1.1.67 in the Context of Augmentation 

To better understand the interaction between 1.1.66 tasminn iti nirdiṣṭe pūrvasya and 1.1.67  tasmād ity uttarasya, let us look at the operational rule 7.1.52 āmi sarvanāmnaḥ suṭ (āt) which  the tradition interprets, based on the two paribhāṣās mentioned above, as follows: the augment  sUṬ is introduced to affix ām when it occurs after a sarvanāman ‘pronominal base’ ending in  a. Even though I think this is indeed the correct interpretation, I disagree with the tradition on  the process through which it arrives at this interpretation. Let us first consider the individual  parts of this sūtra: 

āmi = locative singular form of ām 

sarvanāmnaḥ (āt) = ablative singular forms of sarvanāman and a respectively  sUṬ = nominative singular form of sUṬ 

Since Pāṇini has used the locative singular form āmi, 7.1.52 could potentially be governed by  the metarule 1.1.66 tasminn iti nirdiṣṭe pūrvasya which the tradition interprets as follows: if an  item is mentioned in the operational rule in the locative, then the item to its left undergoes the  operation.2 Similarly, since Pāṇini has used the ablative forms sarvanāmnaḥ and āt, 7.1.52  could potentially be governed by the metarule 1.1.67 tasmād ity uttarasya which the tradition  interprets as follows: if an item is mentioned in the operational rule in the ablative, then the  item to its right undergoes the operation.3 

In sum, according to the tradition, in x + y, if rule K is applicable, then: (i) if y is mentioned in the locative, then, by 1.1.66, x undergoes the operation taught by K. (ii) if x is mentioned in the ablative, then by 1.1.67, y undergoes the operation taught by K. 

Consider the derivation of the genitive plural of the pronominal stem sarva ‘everything’4: sarva  + ām. Here the pronominal stem sarva ends in a and is followed by ām. So, 7.1.52 āmi  sarvanāmnaḥ suṭ (āt) is applicable. By 1.1.66, the augment sUṬ should be attached to sarva 

1 Please read the ‘Introduction’ section of Appendix A before reading further.  2 Kāśikā on 1.1.66: tasminn iti saptamyarthanirdeśe pūrvasyaiva kāryaṁ bhavati nottarasya. 3 Kāśikā on 1.1.67: tasmād iti pañcamyarthanirdeśa uttarasyaiva kāryaṁ bhavati na pūrvasya.  4 Note that I have not mentioned instances of DOI and SOI at different steps of this derivation, since  our focus is on the competition between paribhāṣā rules. Nonetheless, I follow my method of dealing  with SOI and DOI in this derivation.

224 

but by 1.1.67, the augment sUṬ should be attached to ām. Which of the two metarules should  be chosen to govern 7.1.52? 

Through his vārttikas on 1.1.67, Kātyāyana offers a solution to this problem. He says that when  both locative and ablative forms have been used in a rule like 7.1.52, the ablative prevails (vt. 3: ubhayanirdeśe vipratiṣedhāt pañcamīnirdeśaḥ)5, and the locative should be reinterpreted as  a genitive (vt. 14: yathārthaṁ vā ṣaṣṭhīnirdeśaḥ)6. Therefore, according to Kātyāyana, 7.1.52 āmi sarvanāmnaḥ suṭ (āt) means āmaḥ sarvanāmnaḥ suṭ (āt): the augment sUṬ is introduced  to affix ām when it occurs after a sarvanāma ‘pronominal base’ ending in a.  

By 1.1.46 ādyantau ṭakitau (which, according to the tradition, teaches that items marked with  Ṭ and items marked with K should be attached to the beginning and end respectively of items  taught in the genitive7), the augment sUṬ is attached at the beginning of ām. The derivation  proceeds as follows: sarva + ām 🡪 sarva + sām (7.1.52 āmi sarvanāmnaḥ suṭ) 🡪 sarve + sām 

(6.1.97 bahuvacane jhaly et) 🡪 sarveṣām (8.3.59 ādeśapratyayoḥ). 

But does Kātyāyana’s solution enable us to correctly interpret all of Pāṇini’s operational rules  which teach augments? No, it fails to help us correctly interpret rules which teach the insertion  of augments marked with K and contain ablative and / or locative forms e.g., 6.1.75 dīrghāt (che tuk), 6.1.76 padāntād vā (dīrghāt che tuk), 7.2.82 āne muk (ataḥ) and 8.3.31 śi tuk (naś  ca). Let us discuss the rule 6.1.76 padāntād vā (dīrghāt che tuk). In order to correctly interpret  this rule, let us first analyse its parts. che is a locative form, and dīrghāt and padāntāt are both 

ablative forms. Since Pāṇini has used the locative form che, 6.1.76 could potentially be  governed by the metarule 1.1.66 tasminn iti nirdiṣṭe pūrvasya, but since Pāṇini has used the  ablative forms dīrghāt and padāntāt, 6.1.76 could also be governed by the metarule 1.1.67  tasmād ity uttarasya.  

Consider the compound kuṭīcchāyā ‘shade of a hut’. When deriving this form, at step kuṭī +  chāyā, since kuṭī ends in a long vowel and since chāyā begins with a ch, 6.1.76 is applicable. By 1.1.66, the augment tUK should be attached to kuṭī but by 1.1.67, the augment tUK should  be attached to chāyā. Which of the two metarules should be chosen to govern 6.1.76? By  vārttikas 3 and 14, when there is a competition between the ablative and the locative, the  

5 Mbh I.173.1. 

6 Mbh I.174.6. 

7 On 1.1.46, the Kāśikā says: ādiḥ ṭit bhavati antaḥ kit bhavati ṣaṣṭhīnirdiṣṭasya.

225 

ablative prevails and the locative is reinterpreted as a genitive. Thus, according to the  aforementioned vārttikas, 6.1.76 padāntād vā (dīrghāt che tuk) means: padāntād vā dīrghāt  chaḥ tuk ‘the augment tUK is optionally introduced to the item beginning with cha when it is  preceded by a pada ending in a long vowel’. By 1.1.46 ādyantau ṭakitau, the augment tUK is  attached at the end of chāyā. However, this gives the incorrect form: *kuṭīchāyāt. To get the  correct form, we need to attach the augment tUK at the end of kuṭī: kuṭī-t-chāyā 🡪 kuṭīcchāyā (8.4.40 stoś ścunā ścuḥ). This shows that Kātyāyana’s vārttikas cannot help us correctly  interpret augment-insertion rules like 6.1.76.  

Let me now expound on how I tackle this problem. In my opinion, Kātyāyana’s interpretation  of the metarules 1.1.66 and 1.1.67 is not correct. Kātyāyana interprets pūrvasya and uttarasya in 1.1.66 and 1.1.67 as ‘in the place of the LHS item’ and ‘in the place of the RHS item’  respectively. In my opinion, this is not warranted. I think that that we can infer ‘in the place of  X’ only when X has been mentioned (or continued by anuvr̥tti) in the genitive in the operational  rule (cf. 1.1.49 ṣaṣṭhī sthāneyogā, which teaches that a genitive ending, which is not otherwise  interpretable in its context, signifies the relation ‘in the place of’). Let me explain what I mean  by this through examples. In 6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci, iK is mentioned in the genitive and aC in the  locative. Thus, by 1.1.49 ṣaṣṭhī sthāneyogā and 1.1.66 tasminn iti nirdiṣṭe pūrvasya 

respectively, we can interpret 6.1.77 as: 

iK + aC 

 6.1.77 

However, notice that in 6.1.76 padāntād vā (dīrghāt che tuk), Pāṇini has not used a genitive  form, so we cannot interpret it as: 

padānta dīrgha + cha 

 6.1.76 

I interpret pūrvasya in 1.1.66 merely as an indication of the left-hand side and similarly  uttarasya in 1.1.67 merely as an indication of the right-hand side. The best way to offer clarity  on this is to summarize the difference between the traditional and my interpretations of 1.1.66  and 1.1.67 with diagrams. In the table below, I have stated the case in which the word is  mentioned in the operational rule in round brackets:

226

Let me now explain how I interpret the operational rules 7.1.52 āmi sarvanāmnaḥ suṭ (āt) and  6.1.76 padāntād vā (dīrghāt che tuk), based on my interpretations of 1.1.66 and 1.1.67 respectively. Let us start with 7.1.52.  

According to me, there is no competition between metarules 1.1.66 and 1.1.67. In fact, I think  that both 1.1.66 and 1.1.67 are required to interpret 7.1.52:  

(a) 1.1.66 tells us that the augment sUṬ should be placed to the left of affix ām.  sUṬ ām 

(b) 1.1.67 tells us that the augment sUṬ should be placed to the right of sarvanāman ‘the  pronominal base’.  

 sarva sUṬ 

Now, if we put together the teachings of metarules 1.1.66 and 1.1.67, we get: sarva sUṬ ām 

Before we continue, note that there is a difference between Kāśikā’s and my interpretation of  1.1.46 ādyantau ṭakitau. Kāśikā’s interpretation is: ādiḥ ṭit bhavati antaḥ kit bhavati  ṣaṣṭhīnirdiṣṭasya ‘items marked with Ṭ and items marked with K should be attached to the  beginning and end respectively of items taught in the genitive.’ I do not think that we should  take the liberty to read ṣaṣṭhīnirdiṣṭasya ‘taught in the genitive’ into this rule. I think 1.1.46  simply means ‘items marked with Ṭ and items marked with K should be attached to the  beginning and end respectively’. Coming back to 7.1.52, we have: 

sarva sUṬ ām 

sUṬ lies between the end of sarva and the beginning of ām. By my interpretation of 1.1.46  ādyantau ṭakitau, sUṬ should be attached to the beginning of an item. Thus, it is attached to 

227 

(the beginning of) ām. We get: sarva + sām which, as seen above, leads to the correct form  sarveṣām. 

Now let us interpret 6.1.76 padāntād vā (dīrghāt che tuk) using my interpretation of 1.1.66 and  1.1.67. As stated above, I do not think that there is any competition between 1.1.66 and 1.1.67.  In fact, I think that both 1.1.66 and 1.1.67 are required to interpret 6.1.76. 

(a) 1.1.66 tells us that the augment tUK should be placed to the left of ch. tUK chāyā 

(b) 1.1.67 tells us that the augment tUK should be placed to the right of the long vowel.  kuṭī tUK 

Now, if we put together the teachings of metarules 1.1.66 and 1.1.67, we get:  kuṭī tUK chāyā 

tUK lies between the end of kuṭī and the beginning of chāyā. By my interpretation of 1.1.46  ādyantau ṭakitau, tUK should be attached to the end of an item. Thus, it is attached to (the end  of) kuṭī. We get kuṭīt + chāyā which, as seen above, leads to the correct form kuṭīcchāyā. 

I have shown that, using my interpretation of 1.1.46, 1.1.66 and 1.1.67, we can correctly  interpret Pāṇini’s operational rules which teach the insertion of augments marked with Ṭ or K using ablative and locative forms. Kātyāyana’s vārttikas, on the other hand, are not able to  accomplish the same.

228 

### C: ‘Conflicts’ Between Antaraṅga and Bahiraṅga Rules 

In this appendix, I will discuss some traditional examples of ‘conflict’ between antaraṅga and  bahiraṅga rules, and present my opinion on them. Before we begin, let us revise the basic  definition of antaraṅga. According to the Paribhāṣenduśekhara1, ‘antaraṅga is (a rule) the  causes (of the application) of which lie within (or before) the sum of the causes of a bahiraṅga 

rule’.2 An antaraṅga rule is stronger than and thus defeats a bahiraṅga rule.3 

However, note that Kātyāyana and Patañjali, despite talking about antaraṅga and bahiraṅga,  do not define these terms and consequently do not explain why a certain rule is to be regarded  as antaraṅga. In vt. 8 on 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam, Kātyāyana says: antaraṅgam ca.  On this vārttika, Patañjali elaborates: antaraṅgam ca balīyo bhavatīti vaktavyam ‘It should also  be said that [an] antaraṅga [rule] is stronger [than a bahiraṅga rule]’. Let us examine some 

examples discussed by Patañjali (Mbh I.304.10 onwards) while commenting on various  vārttikas on 1.4.2. 

(1) Let us follow Patañjali’s method to derive syona ‘a stitched item i.e., a sack’. First, we add  na to siv ‘to stitch’ by 3.3.1 uṇādayo bahulam.4 By 6.4.19 chvoḥ śūḍ anunāsike ca (which  teaches that ch and v are replaced with ś and ūṬH, respectively, when an affix beginning with  a nasal, or affix KvI, or one beginning with jhaL i.e., a non-nasal stop or a fricative, and marked  with K or Ṅ, follows), we get siū + na. According to Patañjali, two rules are simultaneously  applicable to siū + na: 

s i ū + na 

 6.1.77 7.3.86 

6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci: iK (i, u, r̥, l̥) is replaced with yaṆ (y, v, r, l) when aC (any vowel) follows. 

1 See Pbh 50 in Abhyankar’s reprint (1960: 221-222) of Kielhorn’s translation of the  Paribhāṣenduśekhara. 

2 The Sanskrit text is as follows: antarmadhye bahiraṅgaśāstrīyanimittasamudāyamadhye ’ntarbhūtāny  aṅgāni nimittāni yasya tad antaraṅgam. evaṁ tadīyanimittasamudāyād bahirbhūtāṅgakaṁ bahiraṅgam. See the first two lines under Pbh 50 in Paribhāṣenduśekhara edited by Abhyankar (1962: 76). 3 Antaraṅgabahiraṅgayor antaraṅgo vidhir balīyān (Pbh 115, Vyāḍiparibhāṣāpāṭha). 4 The specific Uṇādisūtra teaching this is 289 siveṣ ṭer yū ca.

229 

7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca: guṇa replaces iK of a verbal base which ends in the augment  pUK or which has a laghu ‘light’ vowel as its penultimate sound when a sārvadhātuka or  ārdhadhātuka affix follows. 

According to Patañjali, the rule teaching substitution with yaṆ (6.1.77) is antaraṅga with  respect to the rule teaching guṇa (7.3.86). This is corroborated by the definition of antaraṅga given by the commentary on Pbh 50 of the Paribhāṣenduśekhara: the cause of application of  6.1.77 (i.e., ū) lies before i.e., to the left of the cause of application of 7.3.86 (i.e., na). Let us  use this example to speculate about how Kātyāyana might have defined antaraṅga and  bahiraṅga. Note that the cause of application of 6.1.77 lies inside (antar) the aṅga siū, while  the cause of application of 7.3.86 lies outside (bahir) it. Thus, the term antaraṅga could stand  for aṅgasya antaḥ and the term bahiraṅga for aṅgād bahiḥ. 

The antaraṅga rule 6.1.77 wins, and thus the derivation proceeds as follows: siū + na 🡪 syū  + na (6.1.77) 🡪 syona (7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ). 

Now let me present my opinion about this example. There is no evidence that Pāṇini has  composed the Uṇādi sūtras. Therefore, this derivation, which requires us to add na to siv as  per an Uṇādisūtra (289) is not Pāṇinian at all. 

(2) Let us use Patañjali’s method to derive the form dyaukāmi ‘male offspring of dyukāma’.  We start by adding the taddhita affix iÑ to the bahuvrīhi compound made up of div and kāma by 4.1.95 ata iÑ (which teaches that the taddhita affix iÑ occurs to denote an offspring after a  syntactically related nominal stem which ends in a). After deleting the inflectional affixes  inside the compound by 2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ, we get div + kāma + iÑ. Here, by  6.1.131 diva ut (which teaches that the final sound of the pada div is replaced with uT), we get  diu + kāma + iÑ. At this stage, according to Patañjali, two rules are simultaneously applicable: 

d i u + kāma + iÑ 

 6.1.77 7.2.117 

6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci: same as above. 

7.2.117 taddhiteṣv acām ādeḥ: the first vowel of the base undergoes vr̥ddhi when an affix  marked with Ñ or Ṇ follows in taddhita derivations.

230This example is similar to the previous one: the cause of application of 6.1.77 (i.e., u) lies  before, namely to the left of the cause of application of 7.2.117 (i.e., iÑ). Here too, Patañjali  says that 6.1.77 is antaraṅga and thus wins. The derivation proceeds as follows: diu + kāma +  iÑ 🡪 dyu + kāma + iÑ (6.1.77) 🡪 dyau + kāma + iÑ (7.2.117) 🡪 dyaukāmi (6.4.148 yasyeti  ca5).  

In my opinion, no such conflict arises in the first place. We want to derive a word that means:  dyukāmasya apatyam pumān ‘male offspring of dyukāma’. Since we are talking about  dyukāma’s offspring, and not (div + kāma)’s offspring, the derivation should start with  dyukāma and not with div + kāma. Thus, we have: dyukāma + Ṅas + iÑ. Ṅas is deleted by  2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ and we get dyukāma + iÑ. Here two rules are simultaneously  applicable: 

 dyukāma + iÑ 

 7.2.117 6.4.148 

7.2.117 taddhiteṣv acām ādeḥ: same as above. 

6.4.148 yasyeti ca: same as above. 

This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.148 and get  dyukām + iÑ. Then we apply 7.2.117 and get dyaukāmi, which is the correct form. 6 

Several other examples discussed by Patañjali in his comments on different vārttikas on 1.4.2,  such as sautthatiḥ, kādraveyaḥ, stairṇiḥ, khaṭvīyati, kāmaṇḍaleya, cauḍi etc. are similar to this  example. For instance, in the derivation of the nominal base sautthati, Patañjali starts with su  + utthita, whereas one should actually start with sūtthita. 

(3) Let us follow Patañjali’s method to derive the form dudyūṣati ‘desires to shine’. We start by adding the desiderative affix saN to the root div ‘to shine’ by 3.1.7 dhātoḥ karmaṇaḥ samānakartr̥kād icchāyāṁ vā (which teaches that the affix saN is optionally introduced after a  verbal stem, the action denoted by which is the object of a verbal stem expressing desire and  both actions have the same agent). Thereafter, by 6.4.19 chvoḥ śūḍ anunāsike ca (see  

5 The final i or a of a bha item is replaced with LOPA when it is followed by ī or a taddhita affix. 6 Note that I have not added the nominative singular affix here for the purpose of brevity. 

231 

translation in example 1), we get diū + saN. Here, according to Patañjali, two rules are  simultaneously applicable: 

{d [i] } ū + saN 

6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci is applicable to i while 6.1.9 sanyaṅoḥ7 is applicable to di. Notice that the  cause of application of 6.1.77 (i.e., ū) lies to the left of the cause of application of 6.1.9 (i.e.,  saN). Patañjali says that 6.1.77 is antaraṅga and thus wins, thereby giving: dyū + saN.  Thereafter, 6.1.9 applies and we get dyūdyū + saN. After applying other rules, we get the  correct form dudyūṣati. 

In my opinion, such a conflict does not arise in the first place. I interpret sanyaṅoḥ as a genitive  form, not as a locative form8. So, in my view, 6.1.9 sanyaṅoḥ teaches that a verbal base ending  in saN or yaṄ, which has not undergone reduplication, is reduplicated9. Note that diū + saN is  not a verbal base ending in saN, but instead two separate items, namely diū and saN. So, 6.1.9  is not applicable here. However, 6.1.77 is applicable here, and on applying it, we get dyū +  saN. Now, since no other rules can be applied here, we can fuse the two items dyū and saN into  a single item dyūṣa, which we can call a verbal base ending in saN. Therefore, 6.1.9 applies  here and we get dyūdyūṣa. After applying other rules, we get the correct verbal base dudyūṣa (and the correct final form dudyūṣati). 

The examples jujñaudanīyiṣati and ātestīryate discussed by Patañjali are similar to this one. 

(4) Patañjali says that in the string ayaja + i + indram ‘I worshipped Indra’, two rules are  simultaneously applicable: 6.1.87 ād guṇaḥ, which is applicable to a + i and 6.1.101 akaḥ savarṇe dīrghaḥ, which is applicable to i + i. He adds that 6.1.87 is antaraṅga and thus win,  thereby giving the correct form: ayaje indram.  

7 If we interpret sanyaṅoḥ as locative, as I think Patañjali does in this case, then this rule teaches that a  verbal base which has not undergone reduplication is reduplicated when followed by saN or yaṄ. Note  that, the whole base does not undergo reduplication. Instead, only one syllable does. See 6.1.1 ekāco  dve prathamasya and 6.1.2 ajāder dvitīyasya. 

8 If we interpret it as locative, it is not possible to derive the form aṭiṭiṣati (Cardona 1997: xviii). Thus, we must interpret it as a genitive. 

9 The whole base does not undergo reduplication. Instead, only one syllable does. See 6.1.1 ekāco dve  prathamasya and 6.1.2 ajāder dvitīyasya.

232 

I do not think that such a conflict arises at all. I think that, in the Pāṇinian system, all possible  rules that can be applied while constructing a word ought to be applied before the word is  considered within the context of the sentence. In other words, these rules, which contribute  towards the construction of a word, cannot be applied after the word enters the sentence. Here,  the rule 6.1.87 applies to ayaja + i, giving the form ayaje. Now that the word is ready, it enters  the sentence: ayaje indram10. 

Other examples of this nature discussed by Patañjali include agnir indraḥ, pacatv atra.  

(5) Let us derive the form vānīya ‘should be weaved’ using Patañjali’s method. We add the  affix anīyaR to veÑ ‘to weave’ by 3.1.96 tavyattavyānīyaraḥ. Here, according to Patañjali, two  rules are simultaneously applicable: 

ve + anīyaR 

 6.1.78 6.1.45 

6.1.78 eco’yavāyāvaḥ: the sounds represented by eC (e, o, ai, and au) are replaced with ay, av,  āy, and āv, respectively, when a vowel follows. 

6.1.45 ād eca upadeśe’śiti: the final sound of a verbal root which ends in eC (e, o, ai, and au) in the Dhātupāṭha is replaced with ā, when an affix which is not marked with Ś follows. 

Patañjali says that 6.1.45 is antaraṅga with respect to 6.1.78 and thus wins. Note that this  contradicts what the commentary on Pbh 50 tells us. We would expect the cause of application of the antaraṅga rule to be within or before that of the bahiraṅga rule. But here, the cause of  application of the bahiraṅga rule 6.1.78 (i.e., a at the beginning of anīyaR) lies inside the cause  of the antaraṅga rule 6.1.45 (i.e., anīyaR). This exemplifies the fact that the antaraṅga tool is  poorly defined and not always useful. 

According to me, this is a case of SOI, and we do not need the antaraṅga tool to deal with  cases of SOI. In case of SOI, the more specific rule wins. Let us compare the two rules: 

10 Here, the following operations take place: ayaje indram 🡪 ayajay indram (6.1.78 eco’yavāyāvaḥ) 🡪 ayaja indram (8.3.19 lopaḥ śākalyasya). 

233 

6.1.78 

e / o / ai / au + vowel 

6.1.45 

e / o / ai / au (end of verbal root) + vowel (beginning of affix not marked with Ś) e / o / ai / au (end of verbal root) + non-vowel (beginning of affix not marked with Ś) 

6.1.45 is more specific because it applies only when the affix is not marked with Ś. Thus, it wins, giving us the correct form vā + anīya 🡪 vānīya (6.1.101 akaḥ savarṇe dīrghaḥ). 

Other examples discussed by Patañjali such as glācchatram, agnicid idam are similar to this  one.  

Finally, Patañjali does not simply say that antaraṅga rules defeat bahiraṅga rules in case of  conflict. He goes a step further to claim: asiddhaṁ bahiraṅgam antaraṅge ‘a bahiraṅga rule is  asiddha with respect to an antaraṅga rule’. Thus, he implies that an antaraṅga rule cannot see  a bahiraṅga rule, and therefore cannot see the outcome of the application of the bahiraṅga rule  either. This is true not only for cases of Same Step Rule Interaction (including conflict) but  also for any pair of antaraṅga-bahiraṅga rules which are not simultaneously applicable.  Consider the following example. 

(6) Consider pacāva + idam. By 6.1.87 ād guṇaḥ, we get pacāvedam. Here, Patañjali claims  that by 3.4.93 eta ai (which teaches that eT, which is a substitute of the first-person replacement  of LOṬ, is replaced with ai), the e in pacāvedam could get replaced with ai, thereby giving the  incorrect phrase *pacāvaidam. He says that this is prevented by the fact that the rule 6.1.87 is  bahiraṅga and thus asiddha with respect to the antaraṅga rule 3.4.93. Thus, 3.4.93 cannot  apply to e, which is the outcome of the application of 6.1.87. This ensures that we get the  correct phrase: pacāvedam. 

I do not agree with Patañjali. As stated before, according to me, in the Pāṇinian system all  possible rules that can be applied while constructing a word ought to be applied before the  word is considered within the context of the sentence. In other words, these rules, which  contribute towards the construction of a word, cannot be applied to the word after it enters the  sentence. Note that, 3.4.93 eta ai is a rule which helps the construction of a word (e.g.,  edhāvahai) and, therefore, it is not applicable at sentence level. 

234 

In conclusion, I think that the antaraṅga tool is completely unnecessary in both SSRI and non SSRI contexts. Most examples (like 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6) which it allegedly solves are not  problematic in the first place. Some examples (like 5) it deals with are actually ordinary cases  of SOI which can be solved by choosing the more specific rule. 

235 

### D: Tables of Concordance 

In this thesis, I have examined some derivational examples which have been previously  discussed by prominent modern scholars such as Kiparsky (1982), Bronkhorst (2004) and Joshi  and Kiparsky (2005). Below I give two tables of concordance.

### E: Some Thoughts on the Siddha Principle 

Let us begin by looking at the fundamental justification given by Joshi and Kiparsky (1979)  for their siddha principle and will present my ideas on the same. In ‘The Ordering of Rules in  Pāṇini’s Grammar’ (1982), Kiparsky gives a detailed explanation of the siddha principle. I will  quote from this paper here. 

Kiparsky proposes the siddha principle on the basis of a vārttika on 6.1.86 ṣatvatukor asiddhaḥ ‘a single replacement in place of the preceding and the following sound segments is suspended1 with respect to any potential replacement with ṣ or insertion of augment tUK’. Kiparsky explains: “Kātyāyana says that making a rule asiddha has two functions: (ṣatvatukor)2 asiddhavacanam ādeśalakṣaṇapratiṣedhārtham utsargalakṣaṇabhāvārthaṁ ca (6.1.86, vt. 1).  

Utsarga here means sthānin, the element which undergoes substitution in a rule.”3 

I translate this vārttika as follows: ‘the statement that ṣ [replacing s] and [the insertion of the  augment] tUK are asiddha [has been made] for the purpose of preventing the operations that  are due for application to the substitute, and facilitating the operations that are due for  application to the substituendum (original item)’. 

Kiparsky then says: “to use terms common in linguistics, asiddhatva blocks bleeding and  feeding between rules.” Before going further, let us understand what he means by feeding and  bleeding: A feeds B if the application of A facilitates the application of B, and P bleeds Q if  the application of P obstructs the application of Q. 

Kiparsky concludes: “it can be said that asiddha and the other devices are restrictions (niyamas)  on a general paribhāṣā that determines how rules interact when no special statement about their  ordering is made in the grammar. This paribhāṣā is not stated in the grammar itself but it is  presupposed by the correct operation of rules in it and implied by the various restrictions on it  that are stated in the grammar. It is to be formulated as ‘sarvatra siddham’ and we refer to it  as the siddha principle.”4 He continues: “[W]hat the siddha principle says is that in the general  case we have ādeśalakṣaṇabhāva and utsargalakṣaṇapratiṣedha…in short, the siddha relations  

1 When A is suspended with respect to B, B cannot acknowledge A. 

2 The vārttika (Mbh III.65.9) has the word ṣatvatukor in it, but when Kiparsky quotes the vārttika, he  excludes this word from it. 

3 Kiparsky 1982: 77. 

4 Ibid., 79.

238 

of bleeding and feeding are given free by the underlying theory of the Aṣṭādhyāyī and if we  must not have them in some particular case, then only something must be said in the grammar  itself.”5 

Further, he says, “As far as feeding is concerned, this really goes without saying. In almost any  derivation, the application of one rule creates scope for another rule to apply, that rule applies  creating scope for a third rule and so on. That all rules in such a chain of rules are to be applied  is taken for granted in the tradition.”6 He adds, “By this point anyone familiar with the topic  will already have recognized that the principle of bleeding order is simply equivalent to the  nitya-principle in the traditional inventory of the paribhāṣās.”7 

Thus, we can say feeding and bleeding together are simply equivalent to nityatva in the  Pāṇinian tradition. And the siddha principle, which means the maximization of feeding and  bleeding, is tantamount to the maximization, wherever possible, of the use of nityatva for rule  conflict resolution, that is, in all cases involving unidirectional blocking. 

5 Ibid. 

6 Ibid. 

7 Ibid., 84-85.

239 

Now, using diagrams, I will explain why I think Joshi and Kiparsky have made a logical error  in interpreting the aforementioned vārttika. I will focus on bleeding and not on feeding, because  as Kiparsky himself says, what he calls ‘feeding’ is built into the Pāṇinian system, and there is  no controversy about it. 

What Kātyāyana’s vārttika implies: 

A  

(asiddha = does not allow  

any recognition of the  

  

suspended i.e., asiddha 

rules and as a result 

bleeding can never take  

place 

A’ 

(siddha = allows  

recognition of all rules  and as a result bleeding  can potentially take  place. It may or may not  take place) 

Kiparsky takes the liberty to interpret this as:   

A  

(asiddha = bleeding 

never takes place) 

A’  

(siddha = bleeding always takes  

place)

240Let us use an analogy to understand this, just like Patañjali often does. Imagine that a young  boy, who is obedient to his parents, can be given one of two possible instructions by his parents  about going near the fire: 

Parental instruction 

	What this instruction actually  entails

	What Kiparsky assumes it entails

	You are not allowed to  go near the fire. (These  rules are asiddha.)

	The child will never burn his  hand. (Bleeding will never take  place).

	The child will never burn his  hand. (Bleeding will never take  place).

	You are allowed to go  near the fire. 

(These rules are siddha.)

	The child can potentially burn his  hand. He may or may not burn his  hand. (Bleeding can potentially  take place. It may or may not take  place.)

	The child will always burn his  hand. (Bleeding will always  take place).

	







I conclude that it is not logically possible to infer the siddha principle from vt. 1 on 6.1.86.  

Regardless of that, let me briefly comment on the following question: how useful is the siddha principle in dealing with cases of SSRI? As stated in chapter 6, the siddha principle rejects the  antaraṅga tool and essentially resorts to the nitya tool to solve not only those cases which the  tradition solves using nityatva, but also those which it solves using antaraṅgatva. Of course,  this means that the siddha principle is able to tackle cases of unidirectional blocking but not of  mutual blocking – which is one of its drawbacks.8 Another drawback of the siddha principle is  that it pays little attention to and offers no solutions for those cases of SSRI which do not  involve any blocking at all (‘non-conflict’). 

How useful is the siddha principle in dealing with cases of unidirectional blocking? Since the  siddha principle is no different from the nitya principle, albeit with a wider scope of application  than the traditional one, the answer to this question is the same as the answer to the question  about the potency of the nitya principle, which I have given in footnote 62 of chapter 4, and  which I reproduce here: “This is exactly why the traditional nitya tool which teaches that the  nitya rule defeats the anitya rule, always correctly resolves cases of DOI involving  

8 As stated towards the end of section 6.2 in chapter 6, Joshi and Kiparsky admit that, for mutual  blocking, “no general solution has been found” (Kiparsky 1987: 295) by them.

241 

unidirectional blocking: the nitya rule is applicable to the RHS operand and the anitya rule to  the LHS operand. By (my interpretation of) 1.4.2, the RHS rule (which is also the nitya rule)  defeats the LHS rule (which is the anitya rule).” However, I do not know if the nitya / siddha principle is always correctly able to solve cases of SOI involving unidirectional blocking. A  majority of the examples discussed in Kiparsky (1982) involve DOI and not SOI. 

A major shortcoming of the nitya, and therefore the siddha principle, is its propensity to look  ahead into the derivation: one needs to know what will happen at the next step if, hypothetically speaking, a certain rule is applied at the presentstep. I think this very much qualifies as ‘looking  ahead’, even though it involves considering merely the potential – and not the actual – future  course of the derivation. Joshi and Kiparsky (2005) take this a step further by proposing the  extended siddha principle which ‘scans entire candidate derivations…’9 thanks to its ‘global  (trans-derivational) “lookahead” condition on derivations’10 ‘…and chooses the one in which  siddha-relations (i.e., bleeding and feeding)11 are maximized’12.13 In simple words, they ask us  to choose, from amongst all possible derivational paths, that derivational path in which the  nitya tool has been applied the highest number of times.  

Why does the derivational path in which siddha relations are maximized lead to the correct  answer though? It is easy to explain this with respect to DOI. In case of DOI, Pāṇini teaches us  (according to my interpretation of 1.4.2) that we must pick the RHS rule. But as we know (see  the footnoted reproduced above), it is the RHS rule which is also the nitya rule in cases of DOI  involving unidirectional blocking. So, it is natural that, of all the possible derivational paths,  the correct one has the highest number of instances in which the nitya (RHS rule) defeats the  anitya (LHS) rule – in cases of DOI involving unidirectional blocking. It is difficult to verify if Joshi and Kiparsky’s extended-siddha principle holds true with respect to SOI. 

Now let us ask: how useful is the extended siddha principle in resolving cases of SSRI? If one  has to chart out all possible derivational paths to make a decision, how is choosing the  derivational path in which siddha-relations are maximized any better than simply choosing the  derivational path which gives the correct grammatical form – which we know thanks to our

knowledge of Sanskrit? And in the latter case, why perform derivations at all if we have to rely  on the correct final form to choose the correct derivational path? 

Joshi and Kiparsky have discussed several examples in the aforementioned papers, a number of which I have solved using my method in this thesis. Please see Appendix D for relevant  tables of concordance. While it is not within the scope of this thesis to discuss in detail Joshi  and Kiparsky’s solutions for individual examples, we ought to study the work produced by  them in greater depth in the future to gain new insights into the functioning of Pāṇini’s  grammar.
