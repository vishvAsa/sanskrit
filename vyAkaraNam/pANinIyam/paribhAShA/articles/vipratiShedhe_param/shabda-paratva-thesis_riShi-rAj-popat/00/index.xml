      <description>&lt;p&gt;If two rules are simultaneously applicable at a given step in a Pāṇinian derivation, which of the  two should be applied? Put differently, in the event of a ‘conflict’ between the two rules, which  rule wins?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the Aṣṭādhyāyī, Pāṇini has taught only one metarule, namely, 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam, to address this problem. Traditional scholars interpret it as follows: ‘in the event of a  conflict between two rules of equal strength, the rule that comes later in the serial order of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī, wins.’&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to thank the late Ms. Ranjana Deshpande who, through her enriching and effortless  pedagogy, lit the spark of Sanskrit in me during my high school years. Secondly, I wish to  express my gratitude towards my Guru, Ms. Geeta Gandhi, who initiated me into the  delightful world of Pāṇinian grammar and who, with her wealth of expertise and experience, continues to motivate and inspire me to this day. I am very grateful to Dr. James Benson who  supervised my Masters at the University of Oxford, and whose in-depth, almost spellbinding,  knowledge of the Aṣṭādhyāyī afforded me the opportunity to improve my understanding of its  infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
