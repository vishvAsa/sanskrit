      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having thrown light on the meaning of 1.4.2 in the previous chapters, I will now try to  reconstruct how Pāṇini must have designed his system and, more pertinently, how he must  have come up with what is arguably one of his most important rules – 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe  paraṁ kāryam. It must be borne in mind that this is a purely speculative endeavour.  Nonetheless, since it stands on the foundation of the evidence provided in previous chapters,  and since it helps one gain a better understanding of the functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, I think  it is worthwhile to engage in such speculation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>6 2 A Summary of Post-Pāṇinian Ideas on 1 4 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Through Kātyāyana’s vārttikas, we know that he interprets para in 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam as ‘the rule which comes later in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial order’. For example,  consider 3.1.67 sārvadhātuke yak which teaches that affix yaK occurs after a verbal root  when a sārvadhātuka affix which denotes bhāva or karman follows. Consider vt. 47 on this  rule: vipratiṣedhād dhi śapo balīyastvam ‘Given the vipratiṣedha8 [between yaK (cf. 3.1.67  sārvadhātuke yak) and ŚaP (cf. 3.1.68 kartari śap)], ŚaP is more powerful [and wins,  because it is para i.e., taught later in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī].’&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have not dealt with rules teaching accentuation in this thesis. However, accentuation is  inseparable from Pāṇinian Sanskrit and thus, I hope to conduct research in the future on  whether we can correctly derive accented forms using my method of tackling SSRI.  Conversely, using my method of dealing with SSRI may enhance our knowledge about how  accentuation actually works in the Pāṇinian system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I have not explored rules taught particularly for deriving Vedic forms in this thesis.  However, in the future, research on derivations involving such rules may enable us to verify the correctness of my findings about Pāṇini’s SSRI mechanism. It could also assist us in  understanding which parts of Vedic literature Pāṇini was familiar with, thereby adding to the  work done by Thieme (1935), Bronkhorst (1991) and others on this subject. In sum, such  research will improve our understanding of the relationship between Pāṇini and the Vedas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
