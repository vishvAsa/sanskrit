      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pāṇini&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; composed the Aṣṭādhyāyī around 350 BC&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in North-Western South Asia.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The  Aṣṭādhyāyī is a samāhāra ‘collection’ of aṣṭa(n) ‘eight’ adhyāyas ‘books’, hence the name  Aṣṭa-adhyāy(a)-ī. Each book of the Aṣṭādhyāyī has four pādas ‘chapters’ that are made up of  sūtras ‘rules’. In all, the Aṣṭādhyāyī comprises about 4000 rules. The Aṣṭādhyāyī is a  comprehensive grammar of the Sanskrit language as known to its author Pāṇini. It stands out  for doing more than merely describing its object language: the Aṣṭādhyāyī is a full-fledged  machine which helps construct grammatically correct Sanskrit words and sentences through a  step-by-step derivation&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; process. In the Aṣṭādhyāyī, Pāṇini does not give us a general  introduction to his work, nor does he discuss the theoretical principles that have been used to  construct his sūtras. He conveys whatever has to be said, through his sūtras alone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>1 2 Metarules in the Pāṇinian Grammatical Tradition</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[[11]]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Early grammatical thought in the Indian subcontinent, as represented by the works called  Prātiśākhyas, was intended to assist the recitation of Vedas by explaining the pronunciation of  accents and dissolution of sandhis. Their objective was merely descriptive, that is, to make  grammatical observations and offer clarifications where necessary. But a number of independent and full-fledged grammars emerged subsequently which sought to ‘derive’  language rather than simply ‘describe’ it: they built mechanistic systems which perform various  operations on bases and affixes in order to produce correct word forms and, using these fully  derived words, to construct meaningful sentences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>1 3 Modern Perspectives on the Functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;purpose-of-vyākaraṇam&#34;&gt;Purpose of vyākaraṇam&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before we explore how modern scholarship perceives the Aṣṭādhyāyī, let us very briefly  consider what the tradition, and more specifically Kātyāyana and Patañjali say, about the meaning and purpose of vyākaraṇa. In vt. 14 of the Paspaśāhnika&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, Kātyāyana says:  lakṣya-lakṣaṇe vyākaraṇam ‘grammar (stands for the combination of) lakṣya i.e., words (and  sentences)’ and lakṣaṇa ‘rules’. This is true of any grammar, not just the Aṣṭādhyāyī. But does  the Aṣṭādhyāyī have certain mechanistic properties which set it apart from conventional  grammars? Below we will look at modern perspectives on this topic. According to Patañjali&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,  vyākaraṇa serves the following purposes:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>1 4 The Traditional View on Rule Conflict</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As will be shown in chapter 6, the views of the tradition have gradually evolved on the topic  of rule conflict. But here, I shall introduce the topic by outlining those ideas on rule conflict  that today’s traditional scholars hold true. To achieve this, I will present the views of the Kāśikā and paribhāṣā texts on this topic. 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam is the only metarule in the  Aṣṭādhyāyī which explicitly deals with rule conflict. Here is Vasu’s English translation of the  rule 1.4.2 of the Aṣṭādhyāyī which is in keeping with the Kāśikā’s interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>1 5 Analysis of the Traditional Perspective</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/sanskrit/vyAkaraNam/pANinIyam/paribhAShA/articles/vipratiShedhe_param/shabda-paratva-thesis_riShi-rAj-popat/01/1_5_Analysis_of_the_Traditional_Perspective/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let us look at 1.4.2 &amp;ldquo;vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam&amp;rdquo; again. Pāṇini does not explain the meaning of  vipratiṣedha in the Aṣṭādhyāyī. The Kāśikā claims that vipratiṣedha means tulyabalavirodha ‘conflict between two equally powerful rules.’ This is a plausible assumption because, in  Sanskrit literature, the term has been used to mean ‘the opposition of two courses of action  which are equally important, the conflict of two even-matched interests’&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But which conflicts  qualify as tulyabala ‘having equal strength’? The Kāśikā says that rule pairs which are not  nitya-anitya, antaraṅga-bahiraṅga, apavāda-utsarga are tulyabala ‘having equal strength’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>1 6 Modern Scholarship on 1 4 2</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/sanskrit/vyAkaraNam/pANinIyam/paribhAShA/articles/vipratiShedhe_param/shabda-paratva-thesis_riShi-rAj-popat/01/1_6_Modern_Scholarship_on_1_4_2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The tradition thinks that 1.4.2 applies to tulyabala conflicts between any two rules of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī. But many modern scholars, starting with Faddegon (1936), have tried to restrict  the scope of 1.4.2 further, to include only those rules that lie between 1.4.2 and 2.2.38: they  argue that since 1.4.2 lies within the ekā saṁjñā adhikāra (cf. 1.4.1 ā kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā ‘up  to 2.2.38 kaḍārāḥ karmadhāraye, each item can take only one saṁjñā’), the jurisdiction of  1.4.2 too should be suspended at 2.2.38.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>1 7 My Opinion</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my view, firstly, Pāṇini did not expect us to create the categories ‘tulyabala’ and  ‘atulyabala’. Secondly, I think that he taught 1.4.2 as a metarule which, rather than being  restricted to a particular section of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, is applicable to the entire Aṣṭādhyāyī.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More broadly, I do not agree with both the traditional and the modern perspectives towards this  topic, because instead of trying to decipher the actual meaning of 1.4.2, these approaches try  to brush 1.4.2 under the carpet, to make it less effective or to weaken its impact.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
