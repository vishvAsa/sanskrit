      <description>&lt;p&gt;[1]: In this chapter, and in the following chapters, I will not provide anuvr̥tta ‘continued’ terms in brackets (unless necessary), even though I did this in the previous chapters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the previous chapter, I introduced my solution to the problem of rule interaction at the same  step. In this chapter, I will discuss the relationship of my solution with other aspects of the  functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let us look at two examples of DOI from nominal inflection which pose a challenge to my  interpretation of 1.4.2. In these two cases, it can be argued that the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s derivational  machine does not follow its own algorithm.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>3 2 DOI in the Inflection of Taddhita, Samāsa and Kr̥danta Nominal Bases</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So far, we have looked at cases of DOI in the inflection of simple (i.e., underived) nominal  bases (cf. 1.2.45 arthavad adhātur apratyayaḥ prātipadikam). Now let us look at some cases  of DOI in the inflection of complex (i.e., derived) nominal bases such as kr̥t ‘primary  derivative’, taddhita ‘secondary derivative’, and samāsa ‘compound’ (cf. 1.2.46  kr̥ttaddhitasamāsāś ca).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, as compared to the inflection of simple nominal bases, which we have  seen in the previous chapter and in this chapter, and verbal inflection and primary derivatives,  which we will see in the following chapters, we find a smaller number of examples of conflict in taddhita derivations, and even fewer examples in samāsa derivations. I will explain why this  is the case towards the end of chapter 4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>3 3 SOI in Taddhita derivations</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/sanskrit/vyAkaraNam/pANinIyam/paribhAShA/articles/vipratiShedhe_param/shabda-paratva-thesis_riShi-rAj-popat/03/3_3_SOI_in_Taddhita_derivations/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The cases of SOI which we find in samāsa derivations are few and fairly simple. I will not be  discussing them in this thesis. In taddhita derivations, we come across examples of SOI between rules teaching affixation. Consider the derivation of autsa ‘male offspring of utsa’ (cf.  4.1.92 tasyāpatyam ‘his offspring’). Three rules teach the addition of three different affixes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4.1.83 prāg dīvyato’ṇ: the taddhita affix aṆ is added to denote senses taught in rules from here  up to 4.4.2 tena dīvyati khanati jayati jitam.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
