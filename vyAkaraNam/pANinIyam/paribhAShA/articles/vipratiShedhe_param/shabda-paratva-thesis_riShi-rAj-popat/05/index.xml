      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the previous chapters, I have shed light on how I think Pāṇini perceives the interactions between simultaneously applicable rules and more specifically, how he resolves cases of SOI  and DOI. In this process, I have also discussed my interpretation of 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, I will dwell on three very important rules of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, which deal with  the concepts of asiddha and asiddhavat. 6.1.86 ṣatvatukor asiddhaḥ and 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham teach the former and 6.4.22 asiddhavad atrā bhāt the latter. I will discuss both the traditional  interpretation of these rules and my own interpretation of them. I will also demonstrate how  these rules impact SOI and DOI, if at all they do, and how they interact with (my interpretation  of) 1.4.2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>5 2 My Interpretation of These Three Rules</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this section, I will present my interpretation of the three rules and support the same with  evidence and examples. I will also show how SOI and DOI function in these sections.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let us first examine 6.1.86 ṣatvatukor asiddhaḥ and 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham respectively. I  think that asiddha in these two rules denotes śāstrāsiddhi: rule X is asiddha with respect to  rule Y. However, when rule X (śāstra) is asiddha with respect to rule Y, the outcome of the  application of rule X (kārya) too will automatically be asiddha with respect to rule Y. In other  words, I think that śāstrāsiddhi always entails kāryāsiddhi. Thus, we conclude that 6.1.86 and  8.2.1 teach śāstrāsiddhi, and therefore, also teach kāryāsiddhi.14&lt;/p&gt;</description>
