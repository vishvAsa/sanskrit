  <meta property="og:description" content="Now I will discuss examples of DOI conflict, which are of interest to the tradition, and show how my interpretation of 1.4.2 is able to solve these cases. I will also consistently apply my interpretations of 1.4.13 and 6.4.1 respectively in all these examples.
In each example, I will prove the existence of DOI conflict and apply my interpretation of 1.4.2 to solve it. As stated in chapter 2, generally speaking, to deal with examples of DOI conflict, the tradition uses nityatva (for cases of unidirectional blocking), niravakāśatva or its interpretation of 1.4.2, as per convenience. To avoid repetition, I will not mention the traditional solution for each example below.">

  <p>Now I will discuss examples of DOI conflict, which are of interest to the tradition, and show  how my interpretation of 1.4.2 is able to solve these cases. I will also consistently apply my  interpretations of 1.4.13 and 6.4.1 respectively in all these examples.</p>
<p>In each example, I will prove the existence of DOI conflict and apply my interpretation of 1.4.2  to solve it. As stated in chapter 2, generally speaking, to deal with examples of DOI conflict,  the tradition uses nityatva (for cases of unidirectional blocking), niravakāśatva or its interpretation of 1.4.2, as per convenience. To avoid repetition, I will not mention the  traditional solution for each example below.</p>
<p>Note that almost all cases of DOI conflict in derivations of finite verbs and primary derivatives  involve unidirectional, and not mutual blocking. We will investigate this further later in this  chapter.</p>
<p>Lastly, also note that kr̥danta forms are prātipadikas by 1.2.46 kr̥ttaddhitasamāsāś ca and thus  they can take suP affixes by 4.1.1 ṅyāpprātipadikāt. However, in the examples I have discussed  in this section, I have not added suP affixes to kr̥danta forms. This is purely to avoid repetition and redundancy. This does not affect the derivations discussed in this chapter.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> For example,  the first derivation śvi + Ktvā should actually begin in the following manner: śvi + Ktvā 🡪 śvi  + Ktvā + sU (4.1.2 su-au-jas…)🡪 śvi + Ktvā (1.1.40 ktvātosunkasunaḥ, 2.4.82 avyayād  āpsupaḥ).</p>
<p>[[121]]</p>
<p>Here onwards, the derivation proceeds as follows:</p>
<h2 id="śvayitvā">śvayitvā</h2>
<ol>
<li>śvi + Ktvā – ‘to swell’, absolutive</li>
</ol>
<p>(6.1.15&raquo;) śvi + (7.2.35&raquo;) Ktvā</p>
<p>6.1.15 vacisvapiyajādīnām kiti: roots vac ‘to speak’, svap ‘to sleep’, and those headed by yaj ‘to perform sacrifice’ undergo samprasāraṇa when an affix marked with K follows.</p>
<p>7.2.35 ārdhadhātukasyeḍ valādeḥ: augment iṬ is attached to an ārdhadhātuka affix beginning  with vaL (any consonant except y).</p>
<p>If iṬ is attached to Ktvā by 7.2.35, then according to 1.2.18 na ktvā seṭ (which teaches that a  Ktvā which has taken the augment iṬ is not treated as marked with K), itvā will no longer be  treated as marked with K. And so, 6.1.15, which applies to certain roots which are followed by  a K-marked affix, will not be applicable at the following step. So, 7.2.35 blocks 6.1.15. On the  other hand, 7.2.35 will still be applicable after the application of 6.1.15. So, 6.1.15 does not  block 7.2.35. This is a case of unidirectional blocking and thus of DOI conflict.</p>
<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 7.2.35 wins and we get: śvi + itvā. Since itvā can  no longer be treated as marked with K, 7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> causes guṇa of  i, thereby giving us śve + itvā. By 6.1.78 eco’yavāyāvaḥ, we get the correct form: śvayitvā.</p>
<h2 id="hatvā">hatvā</h2>
<ol start="2">
<li>han + Kta – ‘to kill’, past passive participle</li>
</ol>
<p>h (6.4.15→)a (6.4.37→)n + Kta</p>
<p>6.4.15 anunāsikasya kvijhaloḥ kṅiti: the penultimate vowel of a base which ends in a nasal  (anunāsika), is replaced with its long counterpart when affix KvI, or an affix beginning with  jhaL ‘a non-nasal stop or a fricative’ and marked with K or Ṅ follows.</p>
<p>[[122]]</p>
<p>6.4.37 anudāttopadeśavanatitanotyādīnām anunāsikalopo jhali kṅiti: the final nasal of a base  marked with anudātta when taught in the Dhātupāṭha, as well as of vanA ‘to like’ and the roots headed by tanU ‘to extend’, is replaced with LOPA when an affix beginning with jhaL ‘a non nasal stop or a fricative’ and marked with K or Ṅ follows.</p>
<p>If n of han is replaced with LOPA by 6.4.37, 6.4.15 will not be applicable at the following step.  But if the vowel of han is lengthened by 6.4.15, 6.4.37 will still be applicable at the following  step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.</p>
<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.37 and get the correct form hata.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>han + jhi – ‘to kill’, present third-person plural</li>
</ol>
<p>As per my interpretation of 1.4.13, han cannot be called an aṅga with respect to jhi. Thus, rules  from the aṅgādhikāra are not applicable at this step. I will not repeat this clarification  henceforth and will assume that the reader is by now familiar with it.</p>
<p>han + jhi 🡪 han + ŚaP + jhi (3.1.68 kartari śap25) 🡪 han + LUK + jhi (2.4.72  adiprabhr̥tibhyaḥ śapaḥ26). Now han and LUK cannot undergo any other operations which are  not triggered by jhi, so han + LUK can be written as han, which is an aṅga with respect to jhi.  Here, the following rules from the aṅgādhikāra (6.4 to 7.4) are applicable:</p>
<p>h a n + jhi</p>
<p>6.4.15 6.4.37 7.1.3</p>
<p>6.4.15 anunāsikasya kvijhaloḥ kṅiti: same as above.</p>
<p>6.4.37 anudāttopadeśavanatitanotyādīnām anunāsikalopo jhali kṅiti: same as above. 7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ: a jh which constitutes the initial sound of an affix is replaced with ant.</p>
<p>We already know from the previous example that there is a Type 2a (DOI conflict) between  6.4.15 and 6.4.37, and that 6.4.37 wins. So now let us consider the relationship between 6.4.37  and 7.1.3.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>If we apply 6.4.37 at this step, 7.1.3 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply  7.1.3 at this step, the affix will no longer begin with a jhaL sound, and therefore 6.4.37 will not  be applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI  conflict. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 7.1.3 wins, and we get han + anti 🡪 hn  + anti (6.4.98 gamahanajanakhanaghasāṁ lopaḥ kṅity anaṅi27) 🡪 ghnanti (7.3.54 ho hanter  ñṇinneṣu28), which is the correct form.</p>

<p>7.2.56 udito vā: augment iṬ is, optionally, attached to affix Ktvā when it follows a verbal root  marked with U.</p>
<p>If, by 7.2.56, the iṬ augment is attached to Ktvā, then 6.4.18, which requires the affix to begin  a specific kind of consonant, will not be applicable at the following step. But if we apply 6.4.18,  7.2.56 will still be applicable at the following step.</p>
<p>This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.</p>
<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.2.56 and get the correct form: kramitvā.</p>
<p>Note that both 6.4.18 and 7.2.56 are optional rules. So, for each of these rules we have a choice.  We can either implement the rule or not do so. Let us consider what happens in different  scenarios:</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>If we do not implement the optional rule 7.2.56, we get:</p>
<p>(i) krantvā, if we do not implement the optional rule 6.4.18; and</p>
<p>(ii) krāntvā, if we do implement the optional rule 6.4.18.</p>
<p>If we implement 7.2.56 but not 6.4.18, we get, again, krāntvā.</p>
<p>All three forms, krantvā, krāntvā and kramitvā are correct.</p>

<p>7.1.37 samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap: in a compound, the first member of which is not naÑ, the  affix Ktvā in the second member of the compound is replaced with LyaP.</p>
<p>If we apply 7.1.37, LyaP replaces Ktvā and so 6.4.18 will not be applicable at the following  step. But if we apply 6.4.18, 7.1.37 will still be applicable at the following step. This is a case  of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.</p>
<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.37 and get the correct form:  atikramya.</p>
<p>It is important to point out an anomaly here. Pāṇini’s rule 2.2.18 kugatiprādayaḥ teaches that  the particle ku, items termed gati (including ati) and items belonging to the group headed by  pra (which also includes ati) combine with syntactically related padas to form tatpuruṣa compounds. We know, thanks to 2.1.4 saha supā, that a compound is composed of forms  ending in suP. Since the three forms krantvā / krāntvā / kramitvā (see example 4 of this section)</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>end in suP (which is replaced with LUK by 2.4.82 avyayād āpsupaḥ), ati can combine with any  of these forms to construct a tatpuruṣa compound. Let us consider each of the three scenarios:</p>
<p>a. Compound between ati and krantvā.</p>
<p>By 7.1.37 samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap, we replace Ktvā with LyaP and get *atikranya, which  is not the correct form.</p>
<p>b. Compound between ati and krāntvā.</p>
<p>By 7.1.37, we replace Ktvā with LyaP and get *atikrānya, which is also not the correct form. c. Compound between ati and kramitvā.</p>
<p>By 7.1.37 samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap, we replace Ktvā with LyaP and get atikramiya 🡪 *atikramitya (6.1.71 hrasvasya piti kr̥ti tuk), which is not the correct form.</p>
<p>To derive the correct form, we have to start the derivation by adding the verbal root kram to ati which constitutes the pūrvapada. To that, we add affix Ktvā: atikram + Ktvā. This alone  gives us the correct answer.30 We see the same phenomenon in examples 6-8 below. But this  runs contrary to how we generally construct compounds – by combining two or more subanta  forms.</p>
<p>Thus, the following question arises: if it is difficult to derive atikramya correctly as a  compound, why does Pāṇini want us to view atikramya as a compound in the first place? This  likely has to do with accentuation, which is not the focus of this thesis. The distinction between  atikramya and atikrāmati (where ati is only a morpho-syntactically bound particle cf. 1.4.8 te  prāg dhātoḥ), the status of particles like ati in Vedic and the relationship between Ktvā and  LyaP in Vedic can all shed more light on this matter, but we cannot delve into these topics  here.</p>

<p>Here, we see that there is an SOI interaction between 6.4.34 and 6.4.3537 and a DOI interaction  between them and 7.1.35. Let’s first deal with the SOI between 6.4.34 and 6.4.35. 6.4.35 is  more specific because it pertains to the hi affix alone and thus wins38.

<p>There is an SOI relationship between 6.4.36 and 6.4.37. 6.4.36 is specifically taught for han +  hi and so it is clearly more specific than 6.4.37. So, we put 6.4.37 aside. Now let us consider  the relationship between 6.4.36 and 7.1.35.</p>
<p>If we apply 6.4.36 at this step, 7.1.35 will still be applicable at the following step.

However, if we apply  7.1.61, that is, if we insert the augment nUM before the final dh (cf. 1.1.47 mid aco’ntyāt  paraḥ), then a is no longer the penultimate sound, and so 7.2.116 will not be applicable at the  following step.

<p>7.3.84 3.1.44</p>

<p>3.1.44 cleḥ sic: cli is replaced with sIC.</p>
<p>There is no conflict between these two rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS  rule 3.1.44 and get bhū + sIC + t. Here three rules are applicable:</p>
<p>bhū + sIC + t</p>
<p>7.3.84 7.2.1 2.4.77</p>
<p>7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ: same as above.</p>
<p>7.2.1 sici vr̥ddhiḥ parasmaipadeṣu: the final sound iK of a verbal base is replaced with its  vr̥ddhi counterpart before a sIC that is followed by a parasmaipada affix.</p>
<p>2.4.77 gātisthāghupābhūbhyaḥ sicaḥ parasmaipadeṣu: affix sIC is replaced with LUK when it  is located after gā ‘to go’, sthā ‘to stand’, ghu ‘a root termed ghu’, pā ‘to drink’, or bhū ‘to be,  become’ and before a parasmaipada affix.</p>

<p>There is an SOI relationship between 7.3.84 and 7.2.1. Since 7.2.1 has been taught for bases  followed by sIC, it is more specific and thus wins. Now let us look at the relationship between  7.2.1 and 2.4.77.</p>
<p>If we apply 7.2.1 at this step, 2.4.77 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply  2.4.77 at this step, 7.2.1 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of  unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.</p>
<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 2.4.77 and get bhū + t. bhū can now be  called an aṅga with respect to t. Note that t cannot trigger guṇa of the ū of bhū due to the  following rule:</p>
<p>7.3.88 bhūsuvos tiṅi: a guṇa vowel does not replace the iK of bhū ‘to be’ and sū ‘to give birth  to’ when a sārvadhātuka tiṄ affix follows.</p>
<p>So only one rule from the aṅgādhikāra, namely 6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ, which is  triggered by t is applicable. It teaches that the udātta augment aṬ is attached to a verbal base  when affixes LUṄ, LAṄ and LR̥Ṅ follow. On applying this rule, we get the correct form: abhūt.</p>

<p>7.2.35 ārdhadhātukasyeḍ valādeḥ: augment iṬ is attached to an ārdhadhātuka affix beginning  with vaL (any consonant except y).</p>

<p>If we apply 7.2.3 at this step, 7.2.35 will be applicable at the following step. But if we attach  the augment iṬ to sIC by 7.2.35 at this step, 7.2.3 will not be applicable at the following step,  due to 7.2.5:</p>

<p>In conclusion, if we apply 7.2.35 at this step, 7.2.3 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.</p>
<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.2.35 and get grah + is + t. grah and is cannot undergo any other operations which are not triggered by t, thus we can write grah + is as grahis. grahis is an aṅga with respect to t. The following rules from the aṅgādhikāra become  applicable:</p>
<p>grahis + t</p>
<p>6.4.71 7.3.96</p>
<p>6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ: same as above.</p>
<p>7.3.96 astisico’pr̥kte: augment īṬ is attached to a consonant-initial sārvadhātuka affix which  consists of only one sound (apṛkta) and occurs after the verbal base as or affix sIC.</p>
<p>There is no conflict between these rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2 we apply the RHS rule  7.3.96 and get grahis + īt. At this step, we apply 6.4.71 and get agrahis + īt. Now that all  possible rules from the sapādasaptādhyāyī have been applied, we apply 8.2.28 iṭa īṭi from the</p>
<p>137</p>
<p>tripādī which replaces the s between iṬ and īṬ with LOPA. This gives us the correct form:  agrahiīt 🡪 agrahīt (6.1.101 akaḥ savarṇe dīrghaḥ).43</p>

<p>There is no conflict between these two rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS  rule 3.4.100 and get gup + t. By my interpretation of 1.4.13, gup is not an aṅga with respect to  t, so rules like 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca which are taught in the aṅgādhikāra and which  are triggered by t cannot apply here. By applying 3.1.43, we get gup + cli + t. Here the  following rules are applicable:</p>
<p>gup + cli + t</p>
<p>7.3.86 3.1.44</p>
<p>7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca: guṇa replaces the iK (i, u, r̥, l̥) of a verbal base which ends  in the augment pUK or which has a laghu ‘light’ vowel as its penultimate sound when a  sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows.</p>
<p>3.1.44 cleḥ sic: same as above.</p>
<p>There is no conflict between the two rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS  rule 3.1.44 and get: gup + sIC + t. Here multiple rules are applicable:</p>

<p>7.3.86 7.2.3 7.2.44</p>
<p>7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca: same as above.</p>
<p>7.2.3 vadavrajahalantasyācaḥ: same as above.</p>
<p>7.2.44 svarati-sūti-sūyati-dhūñ-ūdito vā: augment iṬ is introduced to an ārdhadhātuka affix  which begins with vaL (any consonant except y), provided the same occurs after svr̥ ‘resound’,  ṣūṄ (adādi) ‘give birth to’, ṣūṄ (divādi) ‘give birth to’, dhūÑ ‘to shake’, and roots marked with  Ū.</p>
<p>There is an SOI relationship between 7.3.86 and 7.2.3. 7.2.3 has been taught specifically for a  set of verbs followed by sIC, and thus wins. Now let us look at the DOI relationship between  7.2.44 and 7.2.3.</p>
<p>If we apply 7.2.3 at this step, 7.2.44 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply  7.2.44 at this step, then 7.2.3 will not be applicable at the following step, because of 7.2.4 neṭi which prohibits vr̥ddhi of the vowel of a consonant-final base when the following sIC has taken  the augment iṬ.</p>
<p>This is a case of unidirectional blocking and thus of DOI conflict. By my interpretation of 1.4.2,  we apply the RHS rule 7.2.44 and get gup + is + t. By 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca, we  get gop + is + t. Note that, gop and is cannot undergo any other operations which are not  triggered by t. Thus, we can write gop + is as gopis. gopis is an aṅga with respect to t.</p>
<p>I will not go into the depth of the remaining steps of this derivation because we have seen these  steps in a similar derivation above: gopis + t 🡪 gopis + īt (7.3.96 astisico’pr̥kte) 🡪 agopis +  īt (6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ) 🡪 agopi + īt (8.2.28 iṭa īṭi) 🡪 agopīt (6.1.101 akaḥ savarṇe  dīrghaḥ), which is the correct form.</p>
<p>If we do not implement the optional rule 7.2.44, we get: gup + s + t 🡪 gaups + t (7.2.3  vadavrajahalantasyācaḥ) 🡪 gaups + īt (7.3.96 astisico’pr̥kte) 🡪 agaupsīt (6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ṅṣv  aḍ udāttaḥ), which is also correct.</p>

<p>If we apply 7.3.86 at this step, 3.1.44 will be applicable at the following step. But, if we apply  3.1.44 at this step, 7.3.86 will not be applicable at the following step because of 1.2.11:</p>

<p>By 1.2.11 sIC is treated as marked with K. So, if we apply 3.1.44 at this step, sIC, marked by  K, will not trigger guṇa (here, 7.3.86), thanks to 1.1.5 kṅiti ca, at the following step.</p>
<p>This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.</p>
<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.1.44 and get bhid + s + ta 🡪 bhids +  ta 🡪 abhids + ta (6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ) 🡪 abhidta (8.2.26 jhalo jhali) 🡪 abhitta (8.4.55 khari ca), which is the correct form.</p>

<p>140If we apply 7.3.84 at this step, 7.2.35 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply  7.2.35 at this step, 7.3.84 will not be applicable at the following step due to 1.2.3:</p>
<p>1.2.3 vibhāṣorṇoḥ: an affix with initial augment iṬ is optionally treated as marked with Ṅ when  it occurs after ūrṇuÑ.</p>
<p>So, if we apply 7.2.35, and treat the resultant iṣya as marked with Ṅ, then by 1.1.5 kṅiti ca,  7.3.84 will not be applicable at the following step.</p>
<p>This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.</p>
<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.2.35 and get: ūrṇu + iṣya + ti 🡪 ūrṇuviṣyati (6.4.77 aci śnudhātubhruvāṁ yvor iyaṅuvaṅau45).</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we do not implement the optional rule 1.2.3, then the derivation proceeds  as follows: ūrṇu + iṣya + tiP (7.2.35 ārdhadhātukasyeḍ valādeḥ) 🡪 ūrṇo + iṣya + tip (7.3.84  sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ) 🡪 ūrṇaviṣyati (6.1.78 eco’yavāyāvaḥ).</p>

<p>3.4.100 neither blocks nor is blocked by the other two rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we  apply the right most rule 3.4.100 and get bhū + t. Here two rules are applicable:</p>

<p>7.3.84 3.4.103</p>
<p>If we apply 7.3.84 at this step, 3.4.103 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply  3.4.103 at this step, 7.3.84, which prescribes guṇa of ū, will not be applicable at the following  step. This is because, yāsUṬ is marked with Ṅ and thus by 1.1.5 kṅiti ca, guṇa is blocked.</p>
<p>This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.</p>
<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.103 and get bhū + yāst. Here, again,  two rules are applicable:</p>

<p>8.2.29 skoḥ saṁyogādyor ante ca: the initial s and k of a conjunct which occurs at the end of a  pada, or is followed by jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative), is replaced with LOPA.</p>
<p>Note that both 8.2.23 and 8.2.29 belong to the tripādī section. So, 8.2.29 is asiddha with respect  to 8.2.23. However, this does not impact our method of resolving the SOI between them. I will  discuss this in chapter 5.</p>

<p>7.2.45 radhādibhyaś ca: same as above.</p>
<p>Let us first consider what happens if we implement both optional rules 6.1.59 and 7.2.45.</p>
<p>Let us first look at the relationship between 7.3.86 and 6.1.59. If we apply 7.3.86 at this step,  that will change r̥ to ar, and so 6.1.59, which applies only when the penultimate sound is r̥ will  not be applicable at the following step. If we apply 6.1.59 at this step, r̥ will no longer be the  penultimate sound, so 7.3.86 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of  mutual blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.</p>
<p>Now let us study the relationship between 6.1.59 and 7.2.45. If we apply 6.1.59 at this step,  7.2.45 will still be applicable at the following step. If we apply 7.2.45 at this step, the affix will  no longer begin with jhaL and thus 6.1.59 will not be applicable at the following step. This is  a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.</p>
<p>Lastly, 7.3.86 and 7.2.45 do not block each other.</p>

<p>If we implement the optional rule 7.2.45 but not the optional rule 6.1.59, we get the same form:  tarpitum.

<p>If we apply 6.4.19 at this step, 7.2.56 will be applicable at the following step. If we attach  augment iṬ to tvā by 7.2.56 at this step, then by 1.2.18 na ktvā seṭ47, Ktvā cannot be treated as  marked with K. Thus, 6.4.19 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of  unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.</p>
<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.2.56 and get: div + itvā. Since itvā cannot be treated as marked with K, it can no longer block guṇa and vr̥ddhi (i.e., 1.1.5 kṅiti ca does not hold). Thus, by 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca, we get devitvā, which is the correct  form.</p>

<p>Note that both these rules fall under the heading rule 6.4.22 asiddhavat atrābhāt.

<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.106 and get karu. Since 6.4.106 is  asiddhavat with respect to 6.4.110, 6.4.110 does not acknowledge the outcome of the  application of 6.4.106. Thus 6.4.110 applies, and we get the correct form: kuru.</p>

<p>6.4.101 hujhalbhyo her dhiḥ: hi is replaced with dhi when it occurs after root hu or after a  verbal base ending in jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative).</p>

<p>There is an SOI between 7.1.35 and 6.4.101. 7.1.35 is more specific because it has been taught with respect to benedictive forms.</p>
<p>So now let us look at the relationship between 6.4.119 and 7.1.35. If we apply 6.4.119 at this  step, then 7.1.35 will be applicable at the following step. If we replace hi with tātAṄ by 7.1.35</p>

<p>at this step, 6.4.119 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional  blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.</p>
<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we perform the right-most operation 7.1.35 (which defeats  6.4.101 in SOI, as seen above) and get: as + tāt 🡪 stāt (6.4.111 śnasor allopaḥ), which is the  correct form.</p>
<p>If we do not implement the optional rule 7.1.35, the derivation proceeds as follows: a s + hi</p>

<p>There is no conflict between 6.4.111 and 6.4.119. Let us look at the relationship between  6.4.119 and 6.4.101.</p>
<p>If we apply 6.4.119 at this step, then 6.4.101 will not be applicable at the following step. If we  apply 6.4.101 at this step, then 6.4.119 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a  case of mutual blocking.</p>
<p>Note that all three rules belong to the asiddhavat section. So, each rule can see the other two rules but not the outcome of the application of the other two rules. Since these rules can see  one another, we can use 1.4.2 to solve the DOI between them.</p>
<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right-most rule 6.4.101 and get as + dhi. The other  two rules cannot see the outcome of the application of 6.4.101. They are still applicable:</p>
<p>a s + dhi</p>
<p>6.4.111 6.4.119</p>
<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.119 and get ae + dhi. Here, 6.4.111  applies and we get the correct form edhi.</p>

<p>7.3.84 3.1.66</p>
<p>7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ: guṇa replaces the final iK (i, u, ṛ, ḷ) of a verbal base when  a sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows.</p>
<p>3.1.66 ciṇ bhāvakarmaṇoḥ: CiṆ occurs in place of affix cli after a verbal base when the LUṄ substitute ta denoting bhāva ‘action’ or karman ‘object’ follows.</p>
<p>There is no conflict between these two rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS  rule 3.1.66 and get bhū + CiṆ + ta. Thereafter, the derivation proceeds as follows: bhū + CiṆ + ta 🡪 bhau + CiṆ + ta (7.2.115 aco ñṇiti50) 🡪 bhāv + CiṆ + ta (6.1.78 eco’yavāyāvaḥ).  Since bhāv and CiṆ cannot undergo any other operations which are not triggered by ta, we can  write bhāv + CiṆ as bhāvi. By my interpretation of 1.4.13, bhāvi is an aṅga with respect to ta.</p>
<p>Here, multiple rules from the aṅgādhikāra become applicable:</p>
<p>bhāvi + ta</p>
<p>6.4.71 6.4.104</p>
<p>6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ: the udātta ‘high-pitched’ augment aṬ is attached to a verbal  base when affixes LUṄ, LAṄ and LR̥Ṅ follow.</p>
<p>6.4.104 ciṇo luk: an affix which occurs after CiṆ is replaced with LUK.</p>
<p>Note that both these rules fall under the heading rule 6.4.22 asiddhavad atrābhāt. They are  asiddhavat with respect to each other. That is, each rule acknowledges the existence of the  other rule, but not the outcome of the application of the other rule.</p>
<p>150Since 6.4.71 and 6.4.104 acknowledge each other’s existence, we can use 1.4.2 to deal with  this case of DOI.</p>
<p>If we apply 6.4.71 at this step, 6.4.104 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply  6.4.104 at this step, the affix will be replaced with LUK, and so 6.4.71 will not be applicable at  the following step51. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.</p>
<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.104 and get: bhāvi. Since 6.4.104 is  asiddhavat with respect to 6.4.71, 6.4.71 does not acknowledge the outcome of the application  of 6.4.104. Consequently, 6.4.71 applies, and we get the correct form: abhāvi.</p>

<p>krī + jhi 🡪 krī + Śnā + jhi (3.1.81 kryādibhyaḥ śnā52) 🡪 krīnā + jhi. Now that krīnā is an  aṅga with respect to jhi, the following rules from the aṅgādhikāra become applicable:</p>
<p>krīnā + jhi</p>
<p>6.4.112 6.4.113 7.1.3</p>
<p>6.4.112 śnābhyastayor ātaḥ53: the final ā of a base which ends in Śnā or of a reduplicated base (abhyasta) is replaced with LOPA when a sārvadhātuka affix marked with K or Ṅ follows.</p>
<p>6.4.113 ī haly aghoḥ: the final ā of a base which ends in Śnā or of a reduplicated base  (abhyasta), excluding items termed ghu, is replaced with ī when a sārvadhātuka affix  beginning with a consonant and marked with K or Ṅ follows.</p>
<p>7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ: jh which is the initial sound of an affix is replaced with ant.</p>
<p>There is an SOI between 6.4.112 and 6.4.113. First let us identify the more specific i.e., winning  rule. Then we will examine the DOI between the winning rule and 7.1.3.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p>6.4.113 is more specific because it is applicable only when the affix begins with a consonant, and thus wins. Now let us look at the DOI relationship between 6.4.113 and 7.1.3.</p>
<p>If we apply 6.4.113 at this step, 7.1.3 will be applicable at the following step. However, if we  apply 7.1.3 at this step, jhi will no longer begin with a consonant. Thus 6.4.113 will not be  applicable at the following step.</p>
<p>This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.</p>
<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.3 and get: krīnā+ anti. Here, 6.4.112  applies and we get krīṇanti54 which is the correct form.</p>

<p>3.4.79 ṭita ātmanepadānāṁ ṭer e: the part that begins with the last vowel (ṭi)55 of an  ātmanepada replacement of a lakāra marked with Ṭ is replaced with e.</p>
<p>There is no conflict between these rules.</p>
<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.79 and get udvij + te. Thereafter we  apply 3.1.33 and get udvij + sya + te. Here two rules are applicable:</p>
<p>udvij + sya + te</p>
<p>7.3.86 7.2.35</p>
<p>7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca: guṇa replaces the iK (i, u, r̥, l̥) of a verbal base which ends  in the augment pUK or which has a laghu ‘light’ vowel as its penultimate sound when a  sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>7.2.35 ārdhadhātukasyeḍ valādeḥ: augment iṬ is attached to an ārdhadhātuka affix beginning  with vaL (any consonant except y).</p>
<p>If we apply 7.3.86 at this step, 7.2.35 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply  7.2.35 at this step, 7.3.86 will not be applicable at the following step, because of the following  rule:</p>
<p>1.2.2 vija iṭ: an affix with initial augment iṬ is treated as if marked with Ṅ when it occurs after  OvijI ‘to fear’.</p>
<p>So, if we apply 7.2.35 at this step, the resultant isya, by 1.2.2, will be treated as marked with  Ṅ. Consequently, thanks to 1.1.5 kṅiti ca, 7.3.86 will not be applicable at the following step.</p>
<p>This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.</p>
<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.2.35 and get: udvijisya + te 🡪 udvijiṣyate (8.3.59 ādeśapratyayoḥ), which is the correct form.</p>
<ol start="29">

<p>At this point, bhibhī and ŚLU cannot undergo any other operations which are not triggered by  jhi. Thus, we can write bhibhī + ŚLU as bhibhī. In bhibhī + jhi, bhibhī can now be called an  aṅga with respect to jhi. Thus, the following rules from the aṅgādhikāra become applicable:</p>
<p>bh i bh ī + jh i</p>
<p>6.4.115 7.1.3 7.1.4</p>
<p>6.4.115 bhiyo’nyatarasyām: the final ī of bhī is optionally replaced with i when an affix  beginning with a consonant, and marked with K or Ṅ follows.57</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ: a jh which is the initial sound of an affix is replaced with ant.</p>
<p>7.1.4 ad abhyastāt: when preceded by a reduplicated base, a jh which is the initial sound of an  affix is replaced with at.</p>
<p>There is an SOI relationship between 7.1.3 and 7.1.4. Since 7.1.4 has been taught specifically  for reduplicated bases, it is more specific and thus wins.</p>
<p>Let us consider the relationship between 7.1.4 and 6.4.115. If we apply 6.4.115 at this step,  7.1.4 will be applicable at the following step. But if, by 7.1.4, we replace jh with at, which  starts with a vowel, 6.4.115 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of  unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.</p>
<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.4 (which defeats 7.1.3 in SOI, as seen  above) and get: bhibhī + ati 🡪 bhibhy + ati (6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci). Now that all rules from the  sapādasaptādhyāyī have applied, we can apply 8.4.54 abhyāse car ca from the tripādī. This  gives us bibhyati, which is the correct form.</p>
<p>Note that the optional rule 6.4.115 bhiyo’nyatarasyām, despite being applicable, does not  actually end up applying in this derivation. So even if we had not implemented the optional  rule 6.4.115, we would still have got the same form, i.e., bibhyati.</p>

<p>3.4.100 itaś ca: the i of a replacement of any lakāra marked with Ṅ, is replaced with LOPA.</p>
<p>There is no conflict between these rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right most rule 3.4.100 and get: ṇijIR + t. Here the following rules are applicable:</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>ṇijIR + t</p>
<p>6.1.65 3.1.43</p>
<p>There is no conflict between these rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule  3.1.43 and get ṇij + cli + t. Here the following rules are applicable:</p>
<p>ṇ i jIR + cli + t</p>
<p>6.1.65 7.3.86 3.1.57 3.1.44</p>
<p>6.1.65 ṇo naḥ: same as above.</p>
<p>7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca: same as above.</p>

<p>3.1.57 irito vā: affix cli is optionally replaced with aṄ after verbal roots marked with IR when  a parasmaipada replacement of LUṄ which denotes kartr̥ follows.</p>
<p>6.1.65 is not in conflict with the other rules. There is an SOI relationship between 3.1.44 and  3.1.57. Since 3.1.57 has been specifically taught for roots marked with IR, it wins.</p>
<p>Let us consider the DOI relationship between 7.3.86 and 3.1.57. If we apply 7.3.86 at this step,  3.1.57 will be applicable at the following step. But if we replace cli with aṄ by 3.1.57, then by  1.1.5 kṅiti ca, 7.3.86 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional  blocking and thus of DOI conflict.</p>
<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we perform the right most operation 3.1.57 (which defeats 3.1.44  in SOI, as seen above). We get: ṇij + aṄ + t 🡪 nij + aṄ + t (6.1.65). nij and aṄ cannot undergo  any other operations which are not triggered by t, so we can write nij + aṄ as nija. nija is an  aṅga with respect to t. Thus, we apply 6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ and get anijat, which is  the correct form.</p>
<p>If we do not implement the optional rule 3.1.57 irito vā, the derivation proceeds as follows: ṇij  + cli + t 🡪 ṇij + sIC + t (3.1.44) 🡪 ṇaij + s + t (7.2.3 vadavrajahalantasyācaḥ) 🡪 naij + s</p>

<p>This derivation is very similar to the previous one so I will simply focus on the part involving  DOI conflict. In the rest of the steps, if two rules are simultaneously applicable, I choose the  RHS rule in case of DOI and the more specific rule in case of SOI.</p>

<p>If we apply 7.3.86 at this step, 3.1.53 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply  3.1.53 at this step, then by 1.1.5 kṅiti ca, 7.3.86 will not be applicable at the following step.  This is a case of unidirectional blocking and thus of DOI conflict.</p>
<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.1.53 and get sic + aṄ + t. sic and aṄ cannot undergo any other operations which are not triggered by t. Thus sic + aṄ can be written  as sica. Thereafter 6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ from the aṅgādhikāra applies, leading to the  correct form, asicat.</p>

<p>7.2.56 udito vā: augment iṬ is optionally attached to affix Ktvā when it follows a verbal root  marked with U.</p>
<p>Let us consider the relationship of 7.2.56 with the other two rules. If we apply 6.4.15 or 6.4.37  at this step, 7.2.56 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply 7.2.56 at this step,  then then both 6.4.14 and 6.4.37 will not be applicable at the following step. Thus, 7.2.56  unidirectionally blocks both 6.4.15 and 6.4.37 and is in a DOI conflict with both of them.</p>
<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right most rule 7.2.56 and get vanitvā, which is the  correct form.</p>

<p>If we apply 6.4.15 at this step, 6.4.37 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply  6.4.37 at this step, 6.4.15 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of  unidirectional blocking and of DOI conflict.</p>

<p>3.1.68 neither blocks nor is blocked by the other rules. There is an SOI relationship between  3.4.106 and 3.4.102, and 3.4.106 wins because it has been specifically taught for iṬ.</p>
<p>By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.106 (which defeats 3.4.102 in SOI,  as stated above) and get āhan + aT. Here two rules are applicable:</p>

<p>3.1.68 3.4.102</p>
<p>As stated before, there is no conflict between these two rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2,  we apply the RHS rule 3.4.102 and get āhan + sīya. Thereafter the derivation proceeds as  follows: āhan + sīya 🡪 āhan + ŚaP + sīya (3.1.68 kartari śap) 🡪 āhan + sīya (2.4.72  adiprabhr̥tibhyaḥ śapaḥ). Now āhan can be called an aṅga with respect to sīya. Thus, the  following rules from the aṅgādhikāra are applicable:</p>

<p>If we apply 6.4.37 at this step, 7.2.79 will still be applicable at the following step. But if we  apply 7.2.79 at this step, āhan will no longer be followed by a jhaL sound and thus 6.4.37 will</p>

<p>Note that both v and y can potentially undergo samprasāraṇa by 6.1.16. If we apply 6.1.16 to  v at this step, 6.1.16 will be applicable to y at the following step. But if we apply 6.1.16 to y at  this step, then by 6.1.37 na samprasāraṇe samprasāraṇam, 6.1.16 will not be applicable to v at the following step.
