Before I examine examples of rule interaction at the same step in tiṄ and kr̥t derivations, I will  examine rules 6.4.1 aṅgasya and 1.4.13 yasmāt pratyayavidhis tadādi pratyaye’ṅgam which  play a pivotal role in running Pāṇini’s grammatical machine. 

6.4.1 aṅgasya is an adhikāra (heading) sūtra, the jurisdiction of which continues all the way  up to the end of 7.4. Pāṇini defines the term aṅga in 

> 1.4.13 yasmāt pratyayavidhis tadādi  pratyaye’ṅgam.  

Sharma translates this as follows: 

> ‘a form beginning with that after which an  affix is introduced is termed aṅga when the affix follows’. 

I think that the tradition has not correctly understood these rules, as a result of which it faces  multiple problems in performing certain derivations. In this section, I will present my  interpretations of these rules, and show how my interpretations enable us to perform these  derivations correctly. 

## One anga per pratyaya per derivation
In my opinion, only one item can be called an aṅga with respect to a certain pratyaya in a  derivation. I must admit that I am unable to support this statement using Pāṇini’s rules.  However, through the examples discussed in section 4.2 of this chapter, I will show that it is  not possible to correctly perform certain derivations without accepting this assumption. 

Let me discuss an example from verbal inflection to explain what I mean. Consider the  derivation of the present-tense third-person singular form of cit ‘to think’: 

> cit + LAṬ (3.2.123 vartamāne laṭ[^1]) 🡪 cit + tiP (3.4.77 lasya, 3.4.78 tiptasjhi…[^2]). According to the tradition[^3], cit  is an aṅga with respect to tiP. Then, after we add the vikaraṇa ŚaP by 3.1.68 kartari śap[^4], we  get cit + ŚaP + tiP. According to the tradition, cit + ŚaP too is an aṅga with respect to tiP.  

[^1]: Affix LAṬ occurs after a verbal root when the action is denoted at the current time (vartamāna). 

[^2]: Tip-tas-jhi-sip-thas-tha-mib-vas-mas-ta-ātāṁ-jha-thās-āthāṁ-dhvam-iḍ-vahi-mahiṅ.

[^3]: Though the tradition does not explicitly state this, it becomes clear from the derivations we will  examine below that such is indeed the case.  

[^4]: Affix ŚaP occurs after a verbal root when a sārvadhātuka affix which denotes kartr̥ ‘agent’ follows.

[[109]] 

Thereafter, we apply 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca[^5] to cit and get cet + ŚaP + tiP i.e., ceta  + tiP. According to the tradition, ceta too can be called an aṅga with respect to tiP. 


[^5]: Guṇa replaces the iK of a verbal base which ends in the augment pUK or which has a laghu ‘light’  vowel as its penultimate sound when a sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows. 6 I must clarify that, in my view, the modified version of an aṅga too can be called an aṅga, thanks to  1.1.56 sthānivad ādeśo’nalvidhau, which teaches that the substitute is treated like the substituendum,  except when an operation relative to the original sound is to be performed. So, for example, in deva +  bhyām, deva is an aṅga with respect to bhyām. By applying 7.3.102 supi ca, we get devā + bhyām. devā too can be called an aṅga with respect to bhyām by 1.1.56 sthānivad ādeśo’nalvidhau.

So, cit+++(at cit + tiP step)+++, cit + ŚaP and ceta can all be called aṅga with respect to tiP, in the tradition’s opinion.  I disagree with the traditional perspective: in my opinion, we can have only one aṅga per affix  per derivation[^6]. So, which one of the three options, namely cit, cit + ŚaP and ceta, should be  called an aṅga with respect to tiP? I think ceta alone can be called an aṅga with respect to tiP. 

I will present my arguments to support this claim below. But before we proceed, I must admit  that I am unable to provide any strong evidence from Pāṇini’s rules to justify the arguments I  make below. Nonetheless, I will discuss some derivations in section 4.2 of this chapter which  will prove that if we accept any other item but ceta as the aṅga with respect to tiP, we risk  getting the wrong form at the end of the derivation. That said, now let us consider all three  possibilities, namely cit, cit + ŚaP and ceta.  

Let us first look at cit. If Pāṇini wanted us to treat cit as an aṅga with respect to tiP, he could  have simply said 

> yasmāt pratyayavidhis tad pratyaye’ṅgam 
> ‘a form after which an affix is  introduced is termed aṅga when the affix follows.’ 

Thus, I do not think that we should call cit  an aṅga with respect to tiP. This leaves us with two options: cit + ŚaP and ceta. Let us closely  consider 1.4.13 in the context of this derivation to decide which of the two should be called an  aṅga with respect to tiP.  

> yasmāt – to (lit. after) cit  
pratyayavidhis – (upon the) addition of tiP  
tadādi – that which begins with cit  
pratyaye – when tiP follows  
aṅgam – (is called) aṅga. 

[[110]]

> ‘Upon the addition of tiP to cit, that which begins with cit is called aṅga when tiP follows.’ 

The form which begins with cit is an aṅga with respect to tiP. Can we say that cit + ŚaP begins with cit? I do not think so. I think cit + ŚaP is still just a string of two separate items, namely  the root cit and the vikaraṇa affix ŚaP. Only when they are fused into a single form that begins  with cit, that form can be called an aṅga with respect to tiP. When can we fuse cit and ŚaP into  a single form? I think we can do that after applying all possible rules to cit and ŚaP, except  those that are triggered by tiP.  

So here, we apply 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca to cit (an operation triggered by ŚaP, not  by tiP) and get cet + ŚaP + tiP. Note that cet and ŚaP cannot undergo any other operations which are not triggered by tiP, so we can fuse cet + ŚaP into a single form, i.e., ceta. Ceta begins with cet and is followed by tiP, so it can be called an aṅga with respect to tiP. I  summarize this information in this table: 

| Step             | Question                         | Traditional opinion | My opinion |
|------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|------------|
| cit + tiP        | Is cit an aṅga w.r.t. 7 tiP?     | Yes                 | No         |
| cit + ŚaP + tiP  | Is cit + ŚaP an aṅga w.r.t. tiP? | Yes                 | No         |
| ceta + tiP       | Is ceta an aṅga w.r.t. tiP?      | Yes                 | Yes        |

In my opinion, through 6.4.1 aṅgasya, Pāṇini teaches that, for any P + Q, a rule $$R_P$$ taught in  the aṅgādhikāra which is triggered by Q is applicable to its intended operand P only if P is an  aṅga with respect to affix Q. Similarly, a rule $$R_Q$$ taught in the aṅgādhikāra which is triggered  by P is applicable to its intended operand Q only if P is an aṅga with respect to affix Q. 

Also, note that I agree with the tradition that cit is an aṅga with respect to ŚaP. So, at the step  cit + ŚaP + tiP, 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca, which belongs to the aṅgādhikāra and  which is triggered by ŚaP, is applicable to cit.  

## Situation complexity
Before we go further, note that, we find vikaraṇas only in tiṅanta and kr̥danta derivations. So,  in the rest of the derivations, it is very easy to determine what we should call an aṅga with  respect to the affix. For instance, in deva + bhis (example 1 of section 2.7, chapter 2), deva is  an aṅga with respect to bhis simply because the affix bhis has been added to deva.  

[^7]: w.r.t. = with respect to.

[[111]] 

Similarly,  in sad + vas + Ṅas (example 2 of section 3.2, chapter 3), sad + vas is an aṅga with respect to Ṅas simply because the affix Ṅas has been added to sad + vas. In derivations involving  vikaraṇas, because we add affix C to base A and then add another affix B between base A and  affix C, the process of identifying the aṅga with respect to affix C becomes somewhat  complicated, as observed above.
