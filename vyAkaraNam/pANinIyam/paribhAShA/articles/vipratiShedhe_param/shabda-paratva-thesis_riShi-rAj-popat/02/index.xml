      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the previous chapter, I have discussed how the tradition has misinterpreted 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe  paraṁ kāryam. In this section, I lay the conceptual foundation that will help us understand the  actual meaning of 1.4.2 in the next section (2.2).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over a period of time, I studied different examples in which two vidhi sūtras ‘operational rules’ are simultaneously applicable at the same step of a derivation, from both traditional sources  and modern literature. Henceforth, we will refer to such interaction between two  simultaneously applicable operational rules as ‘Same-Step Rule Interaction’, or simply SSRI. I tried to divide these examples into different groups on the basis of the similarities between  them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2 2 Solutions for Type 1 (SOI) and Type 2 (DOI)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(R1A R2A →) A + B&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which one of the two rules R1A and R2A should we apply at this step? Pāṇini does not give us  any explicit instructions about solving SOI. In my view, if two rules are applicable  simultaneously to the same operand, the rule that is more specific, which we may call ‘the special or exception rule’, wins. Note that this is similar to the traditional notion that an  apavāda ‘exception’ rule defeats an utsarga ‘general’ rule.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2 3 Evidence for My Interpretation of Para</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before going further, let me provide more evidence to support my interpretation of para. The  meaning of para in 1.4.2 can be confirmed by looking at the meaning of para in the rest of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī. The term para has been used by Pāṇini on many occasions. Its occurrences can be  classified into two groups:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;35&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Group A: 1.1.34, 1.4.109, 3.2.39, 3.3.138, 3.4.20, 4.3.5, 5.2.92, 5.3.29, 6.3.8.2&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Group B: 1.1.47, 1.1.51, 1.1.54, 1.1.57, 1.1.70, 1.2.40, 1.4.2, 1.4.62, 1.4.81, 2.1.2, 2.2.31,  2.4.26, 3.1.2, 6.1.84, 6.1.94, 6.1.112, 6.1.115, 6.1.120, 6.2.199, 6.4.156, 7.3.22, 7.3.27, 7.4.80,  7.4.88, 7.4.93, 8.1.2, 8.1.56, 8.2.92, 8.3.4, 8.3.6, 8.3.26, 8.3.27, 8.3.35, 8.3.87, 8.3.110, 8.3.118,  8.4.283, 8.4.58.4&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2 4 A Key Difference Between SOI and DOI</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SOI and DOI have one prominent feature in common: in case of both SOI and DOI, two (or  more) rules are simultaneously applicable at a certain step of the derivation. However, it is  important to shed light on a key difference between SOI and DOI. This difference between SOI  and DOI pertains to whether or not they involve competition between two operands.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[[38]]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Type 1: ( R1A R2A →) A + B&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2 5 Pāṇinian and Post-Pāṇinian Approaches to Derivations</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/sanskrit/vyAkaraNam/pANinIyam/paribhAShA/articles/vipratiShedhe_param/shabda-paratva-thesis_riShi-rAj-popat/02/2_5_pANinian_and_post-pANinian_Approaches_to_Deriv/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to determine why post-Pāṇinian (both traditional and modern) scholars have  misinterpreted Pāṇini’s rule 1.4.2, we need to understand that there is a fundamental difference  between what I think are Pāṇinian&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and post-Pāṇinian conceptions of, or perspectives towards,  the derivational procedure itself. I will explain exactly what I mean by this statement by means  of examining six representative examples of SSRI from both Pāṇinian and post-Pāṇinian  perspectives below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;39&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2 6 Traditional Solutions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now let us look at how the tradition solves examples of conflict. As stated in the previous  chapter, traditional scholars tried to use their interpretation of 1.4.2 (the rule that comes later  in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī wins the conflict) to resolve such conflicts. This often gave  them the wrong answer, so in order to reduce the challenges posed by their interpretation of  1.4.2, they significantly reduced the scope of applicability of 1.4.2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2 7 Examples of DOI</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/sanskrit/vyAkaraNam/pANinIyam/paribhAShA/articles/vipratiShedhe_param/shabda-paratva-thesis_riShi-rAj-popat/02/2_7_Examples_of_DOI/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://vishvAsa.github.io/sanskrit/vyAkaraNam/pANinIyam/paribhAShA/articles/vipratiShedhe_param/shabda-paratva-thesis_riShi-rAj-popat/02/2_7_Examples_of_DOI/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, &amp;ldquo;1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam&amp;rdquo; means: in the event of DOI, the RHS rule  wins. As stated before, I have not used the term ‘rule conflict’ in my interpretation of 1.4.2.  This is because I think that Pāṇini does not require us to use such a concept to understand 1.4.2,  and consequently, to perform derivations correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, as shown above, all post-Pāṇinian discussion pertaining to 1.4.2 has focused on  conflict. So, I do need to deal with the topic of conflict to contextualize my findings in the  contemporary discourse. In other words, I need to show that my interpretation of 1.4.2 correctly  resolves examples of DOI conflict, which I will call Type 2a henceforth. For each example, I  will first prove that the example involves conflict, then discuss my solution to it, and finally  present the traditional solution to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2 8 Examples of SOI</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/sanskrit/vyAkaraNam/pANinIyam/paribhAShA/articles/vipratiShedhe_param/shabda-paratva-thesis_riShi-rAj-popat/02/2_8_Examples_of_SOI/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having discussed examples of DOI, I will now show, through the following examples, that my  solution (i.e., the more specific rule wins) helps deal with cases of SOI. Note that we find very  few examples of RE 5 (SOI non-conflict) in Pāṇinian derivations. These cases are neither  particularly challenging nor of interest to the tradition. Thus, I will only discuss cases of  conflict here. To avoid redundancy, I will refrain from reiterating or proving the existence of  conflict in these examples. I will also develop a systematic procedure to identify which rule is  more specific. At the end of each example, I will mention the traditional solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
