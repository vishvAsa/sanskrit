My friend Dr. P. S. Subrahmanya Sastri, M. A., L. T., PH. D., has decided to cohfer upon me the pleasant and precious privilege of sponsoring, in a short foreword, these lectures in English on the first three ahnikas of Sri Mahabhaṣya by Bhagavan Patanjali. In exercising this privilege, I am happy to say that Dr. Subrahmanya Sastri has had the good fortune of studying the Mahabhaṣya under able teachers and has eagerly sought to acquire suitable opportunities for teaching the Mahabhaṣya through the medium of Sanskrit as well as English to Siromani students and to undergraduates studying for the Sanskrit Honours examinaA modern belletrist tion of the Annamalai University. 
of the Paramaikantin type in English and Sanskrit would prefer Shakespeare and Kalidasa to the whole of the British Empire if he were asked to choose between the Empire and the works of these great poets. In India, the Vaiyakarana tradition cherishes the oft-repeated saying ace . If a privilegecalculus, similar to the Ananda-calculus of the Taittiriyopanisad should be worked out by Väiyakarana traditionists, they would give a scheme in which the opportunity to study and teach the Mahabhasya is on a par with Supreme Sovereignty in a political sense. Remembering all this, Dr. Subrahmanya Sastri has happily chosen portions of the Mahabhaṣya for 
ix 
critical exposition through the medium of English in this work which is designed particularly to be of use to undergraduates studying for the Honours Degree examinations in Indian Universities. The exposition is critical and accurate as far as it goes and is lucid, easy and quite in conformity with traditional commentaries. A very useful and copious Introduction is prefixed to this work and Dr. Sastri has used and reviewed all the available material of importance in the writings of several modern scholarsDr. Kielhorn, Dr. Bhandarkar, Dr. Max-Muller, Dr. Goldstucker, Dr. Faddegon, Dr. Thieme and Dr. Pawate. 
This work, which is now being published by Dr. P. S. Subrahmanya Sastri, carries with it my prayerful wishes and hearty congratulations in the same way and to the same extent as many other works he has been producing and publishing of late in Sanskrit and in Tamil.

the 
Patanjali observes that Panini was the son of Dākṣi, 1 a great ancestor of the author of the Sangraha, that Kautsa He was his pupil 3 and he was known even to children.+ was recognised to be such a great grammarian as to receive the epithets ācārya, bhagavan and sukrt from great scholars like Katyayanas and Patanjali. infer that Patan jali considered him a rşi.

the Chinese traveller, also calls him so. I-tsing, another Chinese traveller, states thus:-"The sutra is the foundation of all grammatical science... It contains 1000 slokas is the work of Panini... Children begin to learn the sutra when they are eight years old and can repeat it in eight months time. "3 Ramabhadra Dikṣita tells us that his father was a rşi named Pani. Sabdakalpadruma says that Panini was recognised by other names also, viz. Ahika, Śalanki, Panina and Salāturiya. 
PANINI'S BIRTH-PLACE. 
Yuan Chwang, the commentator on Himacandra's Abhidhanacintamani and most of the modern scholars consider Panini to be a native of Salatura, a village near modern. Attock in Gandhara. R. O. Franke thinks that he was born in the north (Salatura), but had come to the east (Pataliputra). The author of the Sabdakalpadruma, however, says that his forefathers belonged to Salatura and he 
1 The rishi applied himself earnestly to selecting from the stock of words and formed an etymology of 1000 stanzas each of 32 words. (On Yuan Chwang's Travels in India by Thomas Watters I pp. 221 and 222. Words seem to be a wrong translation for syllables.) 
2 Slokas refer to granthas with 32 syllables.

was not born there. If so, we have to determine his birth-place. Jaimini and Bhartrhari state that Vyakarana is a smrti written by Sistas.1 Acarya Panini was considered a sista by Patanjali and his followers. Sistas, 2 according to Patanjali, are those brahmanas who resided in Aryavarta bounded on the north by the Himalayas, on the south by Pariyātra (a portion of the Vindhyas), on the east by Kalakavana (near Rajmahal hills in Bengal) and on the west by Adarsa (Aravalli hills) and who were proficient in some sastra, full of contentment, free from avarice, possessing high character and doing their duty without expecting any reward therefor-ufficient. Therefore it may not be wrong if we consider him to have lived in Aryavarta. His mention of the eastern country in sutras like rai (1-1-75), i ara (VII-3-24), and of the northern country in sutras like उदीच्यग्रामाच्च बह्वचोऽन्तोदात्तात् (IV-2-109), and his reference to the opinion of the eastern and northern schools in sutras like शोणात्प्राचाम् (IV-4-43), 
chat sefang (VI-3-32) may be taken as sufficient clue to his having lived in the madhyadesa whose boundary is, according to Manudharmasastra, the Himalayas on the north, the Vindhyas on the south, Prayag or Allahabad on the

east and Vinasana or the plains at Ad-badri where the river Sarasvati disappears on the west.! The eastern country referred to by him may denote the countries situated southeast of the Saravati and may consist of the Kasi, Kosala, Vidarbha and Magadha and the northern country may denote those situated north-west thereof.3 The Sarāvati is identified by Wilford with Banganga which passes through the district of Budaon in Rohilkand. In Madhyadesa, he may Beas as possible as he 
have lived as near Vipasa or the enjoins the pratyaya a to the names of the wells north of her. Most of the countries like Kuru Pañcala and cities like Usinara mentioned by him in the sutras are nearer madhyadesa than the eastern and northern countries though some are nearer the northern country. The names of most of the characters found in the Mahabharata are mentioned in the Astadhyayi and the place of accent in the word महाभारत is stated in the siūtra महान् व्रीहि..

Kausambi, the birth-place of Katyayana, the Värttikakāra and Prayag, the abode of the sage Bharadvaja and probably of the Varttikakaras who went by the name of Bharadvajiyas are in the Madhydesa, the probable abode of the Sutrakāra. It has already been said that Salatura was the residence of his forefathers and he seems to have

IS PANINI'S ASTADHYAYI A COMPILATION 
OR AN ORIGINAL WORK! 
"Panini was not the inventor of the Grammatical system preserved in his work, though he improved the system of his predecessors, made his own additions to it... He availed himself of the technical terms of the older grammarians. "6 
"Panini got handed down to him as Upadesa from his acāryas a book of sutras which conformed to the paribhasas now found in the Astd., with the Dhatupatha and the ganapatha as companion volumes to that book of sitras. The book of sitras, Panini found, was incomplete and inadequate as a manual of Sanskrit grammar. So he proceeded to enlarge it mainly by incorporating with it sutras borrowed from grammatical works belonging to schools of grammar other than his own;... by framing, wherever necessary, fresh sutras of his own and adding them to it "7"In the Astd. itself only those sutras can be definitely ascribed to Panini which, though they do not go against the Paribhāṣās found in the Astd., yet can be shown to be additions by Panini by the three tests of mandukapluti, the angelarang 
fer: and the purposeless yogavibhāga. Such sutras form only a

negligible minority in the Astd. Then why call the Astd. system of grammar the Paniniya at all? Why? Because answer Patanjali and Vamana and Jayādityait is पाणिनिना प्रोक्तम्, न तु कृतम् — Paspasā तेन प्रोक्तम् IV. III-101... यत्तेन प्रोक्तम् न च तेन कृतम् . 
27.1 
Pawate took पाणिनिना प्रोक्तम् पाणिनीयम् found in Paspasa along with the bhasya under the sutra a and came to the conclusion that Panini is more a Pravaktr than the author of the Astadhyayi. But, Patanjali has conclusively proved from the use of the words प्रणयति स्म, प्रयुङ्क्ते, करोति, क्रियन्ते, कृतिः, कर्ता, पठितम् शास्ति, आह etc. in the following quotations that Panini is not a mere Pravaktr but also the author. प्रमाणभूत आचार्यो दर्भपवित्रपाणिः शुचावकाशे प्राङ्मुख उपविश्य महता प्रयत्नेन सूत्राणि प्रणयति स्म (M.

The statement Panini got handed down as upadesa from his ācāryas a book of sitras" is quite contrary to the statement of the author of the Kāsika “विनोपदेशेन ज्ञातमुपज्ञातं, स्वयमभिसंबद्धमित्यर्थः, पाणिनिनोपज्ञातं पाणिनीयमकालकं व्याकरणम्" under the sītra उपज्ञाते (IV-3-115) 
Besides Patanjali clearly states that Vyakarana is not nityu as chandi-brāhmanāni. 
Cf. अन्यत्राभिधेयमनित्यं भवति । पाणिनीयमिति वा पाणिनीया इति वा (M. B. under छन्होत्राह्मणानि च तद्विषयाणि IV-2-66)..

In about 4000 sītras of Astādhyāyi, Pāmini mentions the names of seers who held different views in 19 sutras, I the name of acaryas in general in two sulras, eke in one sutra, sarve in one sītra, prācām and udicām in about 20 stitras. Besides, the siūtras जनपदे लुप् (IV-2-81), वरणादिभ्यश्च (IV-2-82), लुपि युक्तवद्वग्रक्तिवचने (I-2-51), 2 औङ आपः (VII-1-18), 3 आङि चापः (VII-3-105) + and आङो नास्त्रियाम् (VII-3-120) are considered to be the sutras of his predecessors. Thus only about fifty sutras deal with the opinion of others. 
Hence it seems that Aṣṭadhyayt should be taken only as an original contribution of Panini to the grammatical literature and not a compilation of the sutras of previous

authors, though he made use of samjnas of his predecessors, and adopted their method as in the use of इत् etc. 
Pawate considers that जनपदे लुप्, वरणादिभ्यश्च, लुपि युक्तethered, are the sutras of purvācāryas and they are refuted by Pārini in the siitras तदशिष्यं संज्ञाप्रमाणत्वात् and लुब्योगाप्रस्थानात् and औङ आपः, आडो नास्त्रियाम् आङि चाप: were incorporated by Panini from previous authors. 1 
Barend Faddegon thinks that the five sutras beginning with aqfar (1-2-53) are interpolations. "The interpolation consisted originally in sutra 53, an antagonistic opinion current in the old grammarian schools and well explained and refuted by Patanjali. Its insertion after 1-2-52 is due to the artificial term lup used in sutra 1-2-51. Afterwards, the term samjna was misunderstood and a long series of objections were interpolated by schoolmasters who did not understand the worth of Panini's researches.2 
Faddegon's theory mostly rests on the interpretation of the sentence किं या एताः कृत्रिमाष्टिघुभादिसंज्ञाः तत्प्रामाण्यादशिष्यम्; नेत्याह : संज्ञानं संज्ञा found in the Mahābhāsya under तदशिष्यं संज्ञाप्रमाणत्वात्. Both the author of the Kāsikā and Faddegon have taken the sentence किं या एताः कृत्रिमाष्टिघुभादिसंज्ञाः तत्प्रामाfare to be the statement of purvapakṣin. But the former holds the view that the purvapakṣin without correctly understanding what तत् in तदशिष्यं stands for and mistaking that it refers to the samjñas created by Panini asked whether ti, ghu, bha etc. need not be mentioned and the siddhantin replies that it was not so since the word in 
tena refers only to those samjñās whose meaning can be well understood. There are many instances in the Mahabhaṣya wherein questions are put by purvapakṣin

Besides he seems to have taken संज्ञा to mean संज्ञान; but संज्ञा (in the sutra) means that through which correct denotation is produced and hence it is said संज्ञाशब्दा हि नानालिङ्गसङ्ख्याः. Faddegon thinks that the interpretations of Patanjali and the author of the Käsikä on T are different. Since the Vārttikakāra himself says पूर्वसूत्रनिर्देशो वापिशलमधीते fa under the sutra agres (IV-1-14) and the Mahabhāsyakāra says पूर्वसूत्रनिर्देशोऽयं under औङ आपः (VII-1-18) पूर्वसूत्रनिर्देशश्च under अह्नोऽदन्तात् (VIII-4-7), it is quite possible that Panini may have incorporated some sutras of the previous authors like Apisali and Kasakrtsna whose works are definitely understood from the Mahabhaṣya to have preceded Panini's. 
without understanding the correct meaning. 
WAS PANINI THE AUTHOR OF THE GANAPATHA OR NOT? 
Pawate says that it seems that the whole of the Ganapatha and consequently the sutras for which the various ganas were written are pre-Paninian" and "Panini received the whole of the Ganapatha from his predecessors as उपदेश ". The arguments that he adduces thereto are that, according to the refierenfem

upadesa includes the ganapatha, and Nagōjibhatta states इत्युक्ते गुरुकर्तृकतायाः स्वरसतः प्रतीतेः' and “Kātyāyana held that the Ganapatha preceded the Sitrapatha" and the statement

in the Mahābhāsya “इदं तर्हि प्रयोजनं, व्यादिपर्युदासेन पर्युदासो मा भूदिति” which suggests that there were two ways of reading सर्वादिगण: 
In the karika there is mention of also and the expression of Nāgajibhatta स्वरसतः प्रतीतेः suggests that the word उपदेश has more meanings than one and Patañjali himself gives two meanings to it प्रत्यक्षमारव्यानमुपदेशः and गुणैः प्रापणमुपदेशः under the siūtra उपदेशेऽजनुनासिक इत् (I-3-2). Two ways of reading raffay might have existed at the time of Patanjali, of which one was generally preferred. There are certain definite statements in the Mahabhasya which suggest that the framework of the ganapatha was the work of Panini and it was further amplified by later authors. 
1. अवरादीनां च पुनः सूत्रपाठे ग्रहणानर्थक्यं गणे पठितत्वात् (Vārttika under I-1-34). The word पुनः is appropriate only if both the Sutrapatha and ganapatha are the works of the same author. 
2. (a) यदयं श्वन्शब्दं गौरादिषु पठति (M. B. under विप्रतिषेधे परं कार्यम् 1-4-2)

4 
(c) यत् सवनादिषु अश्वसनिशब्दं पठति (ibid under VIII-3-110.) 
The word पठति as the predicate of आचार्य which refers to Panini clearly tells us that, in the opinion of Patanjali गौरादिगण, कस्कादिगण and सवनादिगण are the work of Pāmini. 
3. (a) एवमप्यधेः पूर्वनिपातः प्राप्नोति राजदन्तादिषु पाठः करिष्यते (M. B. under V-4-7)

4. (a) अधिकरणे शेतेः पार्श्वदिषूपसङ्ख्यानम् (Vārttika under III-2-15). 
(b) गवि च विन्देः संज्ञायामुपसङ्ख्न्यानम् (M.B. under III-1-138) aga suggests that the Ganapatha was supplemented by Väritikakära. 
The word

चोडाद्यर्थम् - चोडः, कडेरः, केरलः, (M. B. under id.) 
Panini should be credited with the authorship of the framework of Ganapatha, which was amplified later in several ways. The process of amplification may be said to have reached its acme in, the well-known device of the akrtigana fiction. 
WAS PANINI THE AUTHOR OF THE DHATUPATHA OR NOT? 
"The ground-work of the only Dhatupatha we now possess is, like the ground-work of the Unnadi list, the work of Panini" "This list makes use of the same mute letters which are the anubandhas of Panini's grammar, and their 
1 Panini-His place in Sanskrit Literature by T. Goldstucker p. 141. 
xxiiigrammatical value is exactly the same in both works "I This statement of Goldstucker should be true, since Panini limits the number of roots which undergo a particular modification-as शमित्यष्टाभ्यो घिनुण् (III-2-141), फणां च सप्तानाम् (VI-4-125): (VII-3-98). Patanjali himself states that the Dhatupatha should have been a work separate. from the Astadhyayi and it should be the work of Panini.2 The meanings given to roots in the Dhatupatha is considered by Kaiyața to be non-Paniniyan and is held to be the work of Bhimasina by Nagojibhatta. Patanjali shows that someportion of the Dhatupatha was lost before him.+Käiyata shows that the Dhatupatha was amplified later by the Varttikakära and Mahabhāṣyakara. 5 
Pawate says, "The various schools of Sanskrit grammar The seem to have had their own separate Dhatupathas Paninians themselves had their Dhatupatha in more than one version... But at present we have only one version of the Paninian Dhatupatha and the other seems to have been irrecoverably lost... The author of the Ashtadhyayi is not the author of the Dh. P... The Dh. P. seems to be the work of a predecessor of Panini. But nevertheless the arrangement of roots in the Dh. P. clearly shows that the author of the

Dh. P. knew very many sutras now found in the Astd. and so arranged the roots in the Dh. P. as to serve the purposes of those sutras "1 
WAS PANINI THE AUTHOR OF UNADI OR NOT? 
T. Goldstucker says, "All the Unnadi affixes have anubandhas which are exactly the same and have the same grammatical effect as those used by Panini. They cannot be later than this work, for it refers to them: they cannot have preceded it, for Patanjali says that "whatever anubandhas occur in a sutra of a former grammarian, they have no anubandha effect in Panini's work". Consequently the Unnadi list must be of Panini's own authorship. This conclusion is based on the interpretation that इह in the sentence पूर्वसूत्रेषु च येऽनुबन्धा न तैरिहेत्कार्याणि क्रियन्ते (M. B. under और आपः VIH-1-18) means Panini's grammar. Can it not be interpreted to mean the sutras in which such anubandhas have no anubandha effect? Besides the statement of Kāiyata उणादय इत्येव सूत्रमुणादीनां शास्त्रान्तरपठितानां साधुत्वाभ्यनुज्ञानार्थमस्तु इति भावः under S. उणादयो 
(III-3-1) and Nagōjibhatta's statement 
ngunit 
सूत्राणि शाकटायनस्येति सूचितम् under the same sidra suggest that, according to Kaiyața, Unnadi is the work of another grammarian and according to Nägōjibhatta it is the work of Sakatayana. But T. Goldstucker says that, "since Nagoji's conjecture is purely personal, and is not supported by any evidence, I may be allowed, after the explanation I have given, to assume that the Unnadi list is of Panini's authorship." 
WAS PANINI AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF ATHARVAVEDA! 
T. Goldstucker argues that Panini did not have a knowledge of the Atharvaveda since Panini's sutras did not

speak of either the compound 
the compound Atharvangirasas or its derivative Atharvangirasa though he mentions the names Angiras in II-4-65 and atharvanika in (IV-3-133) and (VI-4-174) and though Patanjali mentions आथर्वणो मन्त्रः and आथर्वण आम्नायः under IV-3-133. Do the words arr and arrur found in the gana under IV-2-63 mean only a literary work? Since Atharvavida was named not only अथर्वाङ्गिरस' but also आथर्वण and since the latter is mentioned in the Chandogyōpanisad which is not considered later than Patanjali's Mahabhāṣya, and since the word a generally denotes Vida in Sanskrit Literature, the statement 
must be understood to mean area. Besides, when Patanjali at the beginning of the Mahabhaṣya has stated that Panini deals with both Vaidika and laukika words, he quotes four Vedic texts to represent four Vidas. art to represent the Atharvaveda. three more occasions: 
is the text he quotes He refers to the same on

Paspasa.) 
arancefrenatica (M. B. under I-3-2). 
शश्नोदेवीयं संहितयाधीष्व (ibid under I-4-110). 
The words अथर्वन् and आथर्वण cannot be said to mean only a non-vedic literary work since the other words in the group वसन्त, ग्रीष्म, वर्षा, शरद, शरत् ... are all taken by Patanjali to mean the study of Veda in vasanta etc.3 and the context favours the view that the expression आथर्वण आनायः refers to the Vida whose seer is Atharvan.

P. Thieme tells us that the word fa in S. III-2-51 suggests that Panini is conversant with Atharvaveda since 
fa is found in A. V. 6-16-3. Patanjali, also in his statement, सर्ववेदपारिषदं हीदं शास्त्रम् under तत्पुरुषे कृति बहुलम् (VI-3-14) and under qaft...(II-1-58), Kaiyata through his commentary सर्ववेदसाधारणेनानेन शब्दानां प्रतिपादनं क्रियते and Nāgojibhatta in his gloss इदन्तु सर्वेषां वैदिकानां लौकिकानाञ्च RIPZIGINGRURGH suggests that Panini knew Atharvavedasamhita. 
PANINI'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE CLASSIFICATION 
OF THE VEDAS INTO MANTRA AND BRAHMANA AND THE EXISTENCE OF KALPASOTRAS ETC. 
The mention of the word in the sūtras II-4-80, III-2-71, III-3-96, VI-3-131 and VI-4-141 and of the words ब्राह्मण and कल्प in the sītra पुराणप्रोक्तेषु ब्राह्मणकल्पेषु (IV-3-105) suggests that Panini was aware of the classification of the Vedas into mantrabhagha and brahmanabhaga. Besides, the word gor suggests that some brahmanas and kalpas were considered to be ancient and some to be recent. Kāšikā gives भालुविनः, शाट्यायनिनः, ऐतरेयिणः, पैनी, आरुणपराजी for the former and याज्ञवल्कानि and आश्मरथः for the latter. From this it is evident that the author of the Käsika considered Panini, Yajnavalkya, Asmarathya to be contemporaries or the last two lived a few years before him. याज्ञवल्क्यादिभ्यः प्रतिषेधस्तुल्य- 
ona (Varttika) suggests that, in the opinion of Katyayana, Yajnavalkya was contemporary of Panini. From the statement in the Visnupurāya जनमेजयस्यापि शतानीको भविष्यति । योऽसौ याज्ञवल्क्याद्वेदमधीत्य कृपादस्त्राण्यवाप्य... शौनकोपदेशात् आत्मज्ञानप्रवीणः... it is olear that शतानीक याज्ञवल्क्य, शौनक and कृप are

contemporaries. It may therefore be inferred that Panini could have known Satapatha brahmana. If so, he should have known Suklayajurvēdasamhita. But P. Thieme says that Goldstacker was right in saying that Panini did not draw upon the white Yajurveda. The sītra छन्दोगौक्थिकयाज्ञिकबहुचनटाञ्ज्यः (IV-3-129) explaining the formation of छान्दोग्य. 
tells us that Panini was aware of the Chandogyōpanisad and the brahmanas of the Rgveda. The sutra त्रिंशच्चत्वारिंशतोर्ब्राह्मणे संज्ञायां उणू (V-1-62) may refer to कौषीतकीamor and brar since they have 30 and 40 adhyayas respectively. tegu originated at the country between Kuru and Pancala and it has already been shown that Panini lived in the Madhyadesa. It is quite possible he was quite familiar with all the details relating to these Brahmana texts, such as the number of adhyayas they contained. 
The sutras मस्करमस्करिणौ वेणुपरिव्राजकयोः (VI-1-154) and पाराशर्यशिलालिभ्यां भिक्षुनटसूत्रयोः (IV-3-110) suggest that the fourth asrama was recognised before him and there was a book of sutras dealing with things concerning sannyasins. It is worth considering whether the Bhiksusitra refers to Vidantasutras since its author is said to be Päräsarya here and the adhikarin to study it is generally considered to be sannyasins. Since farerfe is said to be the author of Natasutra, natya

2 Note that कौषीतकि is suggested in the siītra विकर्णकुषीतकात्काश्यपे (IV-1-124.) and Cf. It is really impossible to doubt that V-1-62 with its reference to Brak- 
manas of 30 and 40 chapters refers to the Kausitaki and Aitareya Brahmanas... It would therefore be wholly impossible to rule out knowledge by Panini of other Brahmanas merely because he fails to note striking forms therein found. How much of our Vedic literature did Panini use? There is no doubt regarding the R. V. K. S., M. S., T. S. and A. V. Panini and the Veda by A. B. Keith (Indian Culture Vol. II, p. 737).

should then have, been in a developed state. 
The mention of the word चरण in the sutras चरणेभ्यो धर्मवत् (IV-2-46), marang (IV-3-126) and agraf (VI-3-86) and the mention of तित्तिरि, कठ, कलापि etc. in the sutras where तेन has the anuvrtti, clearly suggest that each Vida had more than one sakha in his time. The sutra IRENE IV-3-69 tells us that Vidas were divided into chapters and they were named after their authors. The word in the sutra area 1-4-29 and its interpretation by Patanjali as नियमपूर्वकाध्ययनम् suggests that Vidas were studied with fran unlike kavyas, works on natya etc.1 
The sutras नित्यं हस्ते पाणावुपयमने ( 1-4-77), साप्तपदीनं सख्यम् (V-2-22) suggest that the important details of the marriage ceremony were the same in Panini's time as they are now. ar: (IV-3-12) suggests that there were śräddhas enjoined in his time. The word in II-3-39 suggests that there wase partition of parental property. The sutras यज्ञकर्मण्यजपन्यूङ्खसामसु (I-2-34), न सुब्रह्मण्यायां स्वरितस्य तृदात्तः (I-2-37), यशे समि स्तुवः (III-3-31) etc. clearly show that most of the details of s also were the same in his time as they are now. 
From the points noted above it follows that there were Srauta, Grhya, and Dharma sutras before Panini's time. 
The sutras आयुधजीविभ्यश्छः पर्वते (IV-3-91), ब्राह्मणकोष्णिके (V-2-71) tell us that a section of brahmanas in the Parvata country lived on weapons. 
Batakrishna Ghosh says, "Pragrhya sutras of Panini, Panini must have been directly copying from the Rk Pratisakhya "2

The words नान्दी, लिपि in III-2-21, शिल्पिनि in III-2-55, श्लोक in III-1-25 and III-2-23 and in III-2-23 and IV-2-65 suggest that writing, architecture, the sutra form of the composition and the designation of to verses were known in his time. The word i in sutras like VIII-2-98 and the word safer in sutras like III-3-129 suggest that Sanskrit was a spoken language in his time and it began to differ from the Sanskrit used in the Vidas. The sutras 
सामान्यवचनैः (II-1-55) उपमितं व्याघ्रादिभिः सामान्याप्रयोगे ( II-1-56) कर्तरि उपमाने (III-2-79) show that the figure of speech उपमा was then known and the word 34 was also used in the sense of equal as is inferred from the sftrau तुल्यार्थैरतुलोपमाभ्यां तृतीयान्य(IV-2-98) tells 
(11-3-72). The sutra afganger 
us that the words दाक्षिणात्यः, पाश्चात्यः and पौरस्त्यः were in use in his time. Originally they may have meant one belonging to the southern country, one belonging to the western and one belonging to the eastern. This may perhaps suggest that Panini was in the madhyadesa and referred to people south, west and east of it.: 
The sutra refem (II-4-63) refers to laska. T. Goldstucker thinks that he is, anterior to Panini. Since it is only a taddhitanta name, it is better to come to a definite conclusion on the point on the strength of another positive evidence. 
1 Under the antro qar fasfaqft: feria: 1-1-2-1 of Baudhayana, the commentator writes दक्षिणेन नर्मदामुत्तरेण कन्यातीर्थम् उत्तरस्तु दक्षिणेन हिमवन्तमुदग्बिन्ध्यस्यै Vatsyayana uses the word दाक्षिणात्यानाम् in siltras II-4-10, II-6-46, 11-7-23 etc. Hence the word fee: may origi nally have meant man of the south and later on may have been restricted to mean the inhabitant of the Deccan.

THE PLAN, THE PRINCIPLE OF COMPOSITION ETC. 
IN THE ASTADHYAYI 
Faddegon in his studies on Panini's grammar writes:The first five chapters deal with the theory of the ultimate components of language or the analytical part of grammar, the sixth and the seventh chapters with the theory of word coalescence and vocalie sandhi in general and the eight with the theory of sentence-coalescence and of consonantal sandhi in general. 
The main principles of Panini's forms of literary composition are mnemotechnical economy, logical division and associative digression, and the subsidiary forms of composition and arrangement are (1) purvatrasiddhatva, (2) distinctive insertion like the definitions of samhita and avasana at the end of adhy. 1, pă. 4, (3) oratorical division like announcing in the last sutra of a pada and the subject of the following pada or giving at the begining of a pada a few additions to the foregoing para and insertion by emergency. A fact of peculiar interest in Panini's composition is the tendency towards dichotomy in the main divisions of his work. The indeclinables (avyayas) are enumerated by Panini in I-1-37-41 and I-4-56-94, the former being based on etymology and the latter on function. The term nipata is used in its wide significance to include all the indiclinables with a relational meaning (conjunctions, model adverbs, close adverbs to finite verbs, prefixes to deverbative nouns and indeclinables, close adverbs which have developed into free adverbs, prepositions) and in a narrow significance to denote only conjunctions and model adverbs. This distinction of a wide and narrow significance appears to be a kind of logical

artfulness chosen for the sake of brevity. The word fr is used in the sense in connection with the notion of an action either expressed or implied' from the use of upasarga in V-4-119, VI-2-177 and VI-3-97 and not in the sense in connection with a word expressing an action, either a finite verb or a diverbative. The terms कर्मप्रवचनीयः and कर्मधारयः might have been due to the influence of the older schools since the word in both is not used in the same sense as that in कर्तुरीप्सिततमं कर्म. 2 
What strikes us then...is the trustworthiness of Panini, His power of observation, his love of language, his deep intellectual and emotional understanding. The worth of Panini's work for us is not in its linguistic information, however valuable many a detail may be, but in its fitness as a training for our understanding the Indian method of composition and specially as a scientific work it offers in The more one studies the this respect great advantages. Astadhyayi, the more one realises the depth and correctness of the characterisation given by Speyer of this work that it is a well-planned and not only virtuosic but also ingenuous text-book.5

KATYAYANA-VARARUCI. 
KatyayanaVararuci was very prominent among a large number of seers Bhāradvājiyas, Sāunāgas, Slokavārttikakāra, s etc. who wrote Vārttikas on Pānini's grammar. Kātyāyana's Värttikas are generally prose, though some of them are verses.* Patanjali mentions the names of other grammarians like Värsyayani, the propounder of the six bhavavikaras, Vadava and refers to others in expressions like apara, aparē, anyë, ācāryas, kñcit etc. 
RELATIONSHIP OF VARTTIKAS TO RANINI'S SUTRAS. 
Varttika is defined thus by Hemacandra:- 
उक्तानुक्तदुरुक्तार्थचिन्ताकारि तु वार्त्तिकम् 
"The 
This is translated by Prof. Goldstucker as under: characteristic feature of a Värttika is criticism in regard to that which is omitted or imperfectly expressed in a sutra".7 Prof. F. Keilhorn, on a close study of the first nine āhnikas

xxxiiof the Mahabhaṣya thinks that the Varttikas consider whether anything has been omitted in the sutras that should have been stated and whether there is in them anything that is superfluous, faulty or objectionable. Prof. Goldstucker, consequently says that "Katyayana did not mean to justify and to defend the rules of Panini, but to find fault with them" and that "Katyayana does not leave the impression of an admirer or friend of Panini, but that of an antagonist, often too, of an unfair antagonist. "2 Prof. Keilhorn, on the other hand, tells us that" the object of the Varttikas is then no other than this, without bias or prejudice to discuss such objections as might be raised to the rules of Panini's grammar and on the one hand to justify Panini by defending him against unfounded criticism and on the other hand to correct, reject, and add to, the rules laid down by him, where defence and justification were considered impossible.3 Prof. Keilhorn deserves our gratitude for having found out the real object of the Varttikas and the attitude of Katyayana towards Panini. From a study of all the 85 ahnikas of the Mahabhasya I see that, of about 1700 sutras discussed there, about 450 have no varttikas. Of the remaining 1250 sutras more than 700 sutras are beautifully explained by the Värttikakära without picking any hole in them. About ten sutras are found by him to be not necessary. In the majority of the remaining 240 sutras only additions and corrections or more correctly, changes in form and meaning are made. Since a long time should have elapsed between Panini's time and Katyayana's time, it is just possible in the spoken language for words to have been changed both morphologically and

semantically and to have become obsolete. Hence the expression दुरुक्तचिन्तन may be appropriate from the stand. point of a descriptive grammarian, but is unsound from the standpoint of a historical grammarian. Katyayana shows himself a historical grammarian in having noticed such changes. 
KATYAYANA WAS LATER THAN PANINI 
The following värttikas clearly show the great regard Kātyāyana had towards Pāmini: 
(1) आचार्याचारात्संज्ञासिद्धि: ( Vārttika under वृद्धिरादैच् I-1-1) (2) भूवादीनां वकारोऽयं मङ्गलार्थः प्रयुज्यते (ibid under भूवादयो 
धातवः I-3-1). 
(3) नित्ये च यः शाकलभाक्समासे । 
तदर्थमेतद्भगवांश्चकार || (ibid under इको यणचि VI-1-77). (4) बहुव्रीहिस्वरं शास्ति समासान्तविधेः सुकृत् (ibid under बहुवाँहौ... VI-2-1). 
VII-1-2). 
(5) प्रातिपदिकविज्ञानाच्च पाणिनेः सिद्धम् (ibid under आयन् ... 
(6) सिद्धं तु तद्गुणसंविज्ञानात्पाणिनेर्यथा लोके (ibid under एकाचो द्वे प्रथमस्य VI-1-1). 
(7) एकशेषनिर्देशाद्वा स्वरभिन्नानां भगवतः पाणिनेः सिद्धम् (ibid under अ अ VIII-4-68). 
The word सुकृत् and भगवान् used to refer to Pāmini speak volumes. Katyayana seems to admire the service rendered by Panini and the great traits of his character. 
1 Cf. Panini-His place in Sanskrit Literature by T. Goldstucker, 
pp. 95-98. 
Form according to Panini: (a) एकतरत् (अङ्गतरादिभ्यः पचभ्यः VII-1-25); (b) चिद्ययम् चिन्मयम् (यरोऽनुनासिकेऽ- 
नुनासिको या VIII-4-45); 
(c) आश्चर्यमनित्ये (VI-1-147) 
(not permanent, rare)., 
(d) भोज्यं भक्ष्ये (VII-3-69) 
(applicable to the eating of solid alone).

Form according to Katyayana: 
एकतरम् (एकतरात् प्रतिषेधो वक्तव्यः) चिद्मयम् became obsolete (प्रत्यये 
भाषायां नित्यम् ). आश्चर्यमद्भुत इति वक्तव्यम् 
(wonderful). 
भोज्यमभ्यवहार्यमिति वक्तव्यम् 
(applicable to the eating of solid and liquid). 
When such is the case, it is not possible to think that they were contemporaries as is said in the Kathasaritsägara and that Katyayana was an intelligent pupil and Panini was an idiot under the Acarya Varsa and they respectively composed Astadhyayi and Varttika through Siva's gracel Ramabhadra Dikṣita, in his Patanjalicarita improves upon Kathasaritsagara by omitting to say that Panini was an idiot and perhaps to emphasise the necessity for Sesa's avatara as Patanjali makes both Panini and Katyayana curse each other. 2

Since in Kathasaritsägara, the stories are said to be narrated by Katyayana and since Katyayana was definitely known to have written Värttika on Panini's work, the author may have thought it necessary that Katyayana should be shown as a precocious pupil, that Panini was an idiot, that he was able to write his work through Siva's grace and through Siva's inter- vention and grace Katyayana wrote the Varttika on his work. 
But at the same time we read the following statement regarding Panini in pages 221 and 222 of the first volume of the book, On Yuan Chwang's Travels in India by Thomas Watters:- 
"Five hundred years after Buddha's decease, a great Arhat from Kashmir in his travels as an apostle arrived at this place (a tope in Po-lo-tu-lo). Here he saw a brahmin teacher chastising a young pupil: in reply to the Arhat's question, the teacher said he beat the boy for not making progress in Etymology.... The Arhat answered, "This boy of yours is that rishi (Panini)." 
Since this story should have been current long before Kathasaritsagara was written, it may have been made use of, that Panini was an idiot, though, according to it, he was so in his next birth. 
We may positively state that Katyayana lived long after Panini from the following point:- There is a varttika Enfant anfe: (under 1-2-64); Patanjali states at ag खलु दाक्षायणेन सङ्ग्रहस्य कृतिः (under II-3-66), सङ्ग्रह एतत्प्राधान्येन परीक्षितम् (Paspasa) and आपिशलपाणिनीयव्याडीयगौतमीयाः (under VI-2-36); and Kathasaritsagara says, 
अध्यापयितुमस्मांश्च प्रवृत्तोभूदसौ ततः । 
सकृच्छुतं मया तत्र द्विः श्रुतं व्याडिना तथा ॥ (II-79) 
xxxvii 
Since Vyadi is Dakṣayana and he was a contemporary of Kātyāyana, Kātyāyana could not have been Pāmini's contem- porary. but should have lived at least 200 years later than he. 
KĀTYĀYANA'S BIRTHPLACE ETC. 
Katyayana is said to have been born at Kausambi, to Somadatta and Vasudatta and educated under Varsa at Patali- putra and to have narrated the stories found in the Katha- saritsagara in the forests of the Vindhyas. He is also said to have been the minister of Yogananda. Perhaps the Varttika 'गहादिषु पृथिवीमध्यस्य मध्यमभावः under IV-2-138 suggests that he is a Madhyadesiya. From Patañjali's statement प्रियतद्धिता दाक्षिणात्याः under यथा लौकिकवैदिकेषु in Paspasāhnika, it is generally said that Katyayana was a Southerner and he was sneered at by Patañjali. R. G. Bhandarkar takes him to be a Southerner and Prof. Goldstucker says that he is one of the Eastern school. The reason therefor is that Katyayana

is called आचार्य and Patañjali, आचार्यदेशीय by Kāiyata in his Pradipa under rar: for ag (V-2-39) and Patanjali is taken by him to be identical with Gonardiya in his Pradipa under the sutra anucaccenfeng (1-1-21) and Gonarda is in the eastern country and the Käsika gives under qatar (1-1-75) the example . But it will be dealt with later on that it is not easy to decide that a refers only to Patanjali. If so, the theory that Katyayana belonged to eastern school may not stand. If it is stated that, because he is said in Kathasaritsagara to have studied under Varsa at Pataliputra, he may be taken to belong to the Eastern school, it is also stated there that he forgot the whole of Aindra Vyakarana which he studied under him. From the way in which Katyayana explains many sulras of Panini as if each is an adhikarana and the regard he has for Panini, it is certain that he should have been an adherent of the Paniniyan school and studied in the madhyadesa near his birth-place Kausāmbi. Why he was stated to be a Dakṣinatya by Patanjali has to be explained. From the way in which he refers to Katyayana in many places of the Mahabhasya, it is clear that he holds him as a great seer who well supplemented Panini's sutras. This is a clear proof that Patanjali cannot be taken to have sneered at him. In that case we have to take it that he calls him a Dakṣinatya following some of the northern grammarians who

Under the sutra were faufavfer: afrua:1-1-2-1, of the Baudhayana Dharma- sfitra, the commentator says दक्षिणेन नर्मदामुत्तरेण कन्यातीर्थम् and Vatsyayana, in his Kamasutra makes mention of aferen in H-6-46 and II-7-23 and Bhartrhari mentions ferng in his Vakyapadiya and run is generally taken by modern scholars to refer to the resident of afror or Deccan. Panini gives the derivation of funer in IV-2-98 to denote only a Southerner. Therefore it is a matter for further consideration whether Katyayana is taken as a Southerner because he was so called by the residents of countries north of his place or on account of his having resided long in the forests of the Vindhyas. 
MERITS OF KATYAYANA 
In explaining sutras, he adopts the method which is generally used in dealing with an adhikarana by giving the purvapaksa, answering the points raised and finally giving siddhanta. He also explains grammatical points on the analogy of incidents found in the world and mentioned in the Vedas, from the experience of the world, from nature, from nyayas or maxims like.

वचनप्रामाण्यात् (under VIII-2-1) 
This clearly shows the high regard Katyayana had towards Pāmini. 
He tells us that Panini makes use of the samjna from the previous grammar Apisalam and mentions वाजप्यायन, व्याडि and पौष्करसादि' who are not mentioned by Pāmini. 
He shows that, in certain cases, the sutras may be split in a different way. From this he clearly informs us that they were studied in Samhita form and they were taught how to split it into different sutras by the teachers. Since Katyayana suggests yogavibhāga in many places, it is quite possible that he should have lived long after the time of Panini. His knowledge of Southern India made him modify Kambojalluk (IV-1-175 ) into Kambojadibhyā luke to include the Chola country. 
. . 
He gives us room to infer from his statement सर्वस्य वा चेतनावत्त्वात् under the siitra घातोः कर्मणः (III-1-7) and Kāiyata's commentary आत्माद्वैतदर्शनेन and Nāgojibhatta's gloss सर्वत्र परिणामदर्शनेन चेतनाधिष्ठानं विना न च तदसम्भवात्सर्वस्य तदधिष्ठि तत्वं ज्ञायते on the same that he was an advāitin and his expres sion वचनप्रामाण्यात् under II-1-1. shows that he considered the शब्दप्रमाण to be most powerful... 
In the discussion on समर्थः पदविधिः (II-1-1) there is a sentence वार्त्तिककारवचनप्रामाण्यात्. Its other reading is वार्त्तिक- चचनप्रामाण्यात्.: Uddyotakāra having taken the former reading says thus :- 
न च वचनेत्यस्यापि वार्त्तिकत्वात् वार्त्तिककृता स्वीयवचसः कथं प्रमाणत्वे- नाश्रयणमिति भाष्ये वार्त्तिकेत्याद्यनुपपन्नमिति वाच्यम् । अन्योऽयं वार्त्तिककारो वार्त्तिककारान्तरीयैतद्वचनं प्रमाणान्तरत्वेनाश्रयतीत्यदोषात्.

But since सिद्धं तु कास्खतिदुर्गतिवचनात्प्रादयः कार्थः is found as a vārttika under the siūtra कुगतिप्रादयः (II-2-18), the statement of Nägōjibhatta needs revision and it is better to take the second reading and to interpret that one varttika mentioned elsewhere is stated in support of another värttika. Hence it is not safe to infer that Katyayana referred to another Värttikakāra. 
Patañjali's statements वार्त्तिकत्रिकः साङ्ग्रहसूत्रिकः and सवार्त्तिकः ससङ्ग्रहः under क्रतूक्थादिसूत्रान्ताट्टुक IV-2-60 suggest that Katyayana and Vyadi were contemporaries, that they respecti- vely wrote Värttika and Sangraha, that Panini's sutras were studied along with varttikas and Sangraha and that Patanjali made use of both in his Mahabhāṣya. 
The vārttika : 
नाम च धातुजमाह निरुक्ते व्याकरणे शकटस्य च तोकम् 
under उणादयो बहुलम् (III-3-1) shows that the Vārttikakāra wrote his värllika after Yaska wrote his Nirukta. 
The vārttika : 
भूवादीनां वकारोऽयं मङ्गलार्थः प्रयुज्यते 
shows that the practice of doing to see that one's work is completed without impediment was prevalent before Varttika- kāra's time. 
The sītra एच इग्घ्रस्वादेशे (I-1-48) is found stated to be un- necessary by the Värtlikakära on the strength of the point : सस्थानत्वात् and ऐचोश्चोत्तरभूयस्त्वात्. Under the siitra प्लुतावैच इदुतौ (VIII-2-106) he gives the vārttika सिद्धं तु इदुतोर्दीर्घवचनात्. Since this is possible in the opinion of Patañjali only when मात्राऽवर्णस्य

xliii#equiquien, Nagojibhatta says that Katyayana is inconsitent. It may be noted that it is the Taittiriyapratisakhya that says 
अकारार्धमैकारौकारयोरादिः (I-26) 
इकारोध्यर्धः पूर्वस्य शेषः, उकारस्तूत्तरस्य (I-28) 
while Suklayajurvēdaprātiśakhya says 
ऐकारौकारयोः कण्ट्या पूर्वा मात्रा ताल्वोष्ठयोरुत्तरा 1-73. 
The vārttilus सिद्धे शब्दार्थसम्बन्धे and आदित्यवत्स्युः found in Paspasahnika and Pratyähärähnika have parallels in the Jāiminiya sutras औत्पत्तिकस्तु शब्दस्यार्थेन सम्बन्धः (I-1-5) and आदित्यवद् यौगपद्यम् ( 1-1-15). These along with the värttika आम्नायशब्दानामान्यभाव्यं स्वरवर्णानुपूर्वीदेशकालनियतत्वात् under V-2-59 suggest that it is possible that Katyayana lived after Jaimini. About 8 sītras like न धातुलोप आर्धधातुके, दीधीवेवीटाम्, नाज्झलौ, ra are found unnecessary by Katyāyana. It has already been stated that Katyayana made his contribution to the Ganapatha. He was, perhaps, aware of the science of medicine since he says

HIS LIFE 
Bhartrhari, in his Vakyapadiya, says that it is through grammar one learns the correct words, that the knowledge- of grammar leads one to Mökṣa, that grammarians became so lazy as to need short-cuts in grammar and that, conse- quently, the sangraha was not studied, that Patanjali, the great, composed the Mahabhaṣya bristling with the worldly maxims, that its study became limited to a narrow circle, that it existed in a book-form among Dakṣinatyas, that the

Acarya Candra, at the request of Abhimanyu, the king of Kashmir, learnt it under Parvata, and popularised its study in Kashmir. He suggests that Patanjali was the author of treatises on Yoga and medicine and others express it plainly.3

But there are also others who think that Patanjali, the author of the Yogasutra is different from Patanjali, the author of the Mahābhāṣya. 
I-tsing, the Chinese traveller, writes "There is a com- mentary on the vrtti-sutra entitled carni containing 24,000 slokas. It is a work of the learned Patanjali. 
This again 
cites the former sutras (Panini) explaining the obscure points and analysing the principles contained in it and it illustrates the later commentary (vrtti) clearing up many difficulties. Advanced scholars learn it in three years."2 
Ramabhadra Diksita, in his Patanjalicarita says thus:- Gonika, the daughter of a muni gave arghya to Sun-god praying for a son. Sesa, the lord of serpents, fell in her hand in the form of a sage. He then prayed to Siva at Chidambaram to enable him to write a bhasya on the värttikas of Katyayana. He granted it; thousands of pupils went to him to learn his bhāṣya. He agreed to teach them on condition that he would hang à curtain between him and them and they should never meddle with it. So did the instruction go for some time. Once wondering at the way he answered their questions, they threw aside the curtain. He cursed them at once. One of them was then absent. Though he was cursed for having gone away in the middle without performing uttarasanti, he, 
his repeated request, was informed that would be freed from the effect of the curse after teaching

occurs four times in the Mahabhaṣya:- under the sutras आद्यन्तवदेकस्मिन् (1-1-21), न बहुव्रीहौ (I-1-29), तत्रोपपदं सप्तमीस्थम् (III-1-92) and जराया जरसन्यतरस्याम् (VII-2-101). 
In the first case when it is said that आद्यन्तवद्भाव need not be mentioned in the vārttika अपूर्वानुत्तरलक्षणत्वाद्यन्तयोः सिद्धमे- कस्मिन्, the expression गोनर्दीयस्त्वाह 'सत्यमेतत्सति त्वन्यस्मिन्निति'. सति त्वन्यस्मिन्' is the first vārttika under the sutra. Hence the vārttika 'अपूर्व should be taken to belong to one who is other than the author of the vārttila "सति तु. 
37 
If the first värttika belongs to Katyayana, mrefu should refer to him alone. If the vārttika 'अपूर्व...' is taken to belong to him, should refer to another Varttikakära. A doubt may arise whether Patanjali quotes any varttika belonging to 
any 
Värttikakāra other than Katyayana at the commencement of the discussion on any sutra. The värttika 
स्मादिविधिः पुरान्ते यद्यविशेषेण किं कृतं भवति । 
66 
न स्मपुराद्यतन इति ब्रुवता कात्यायनेनेह ॥ under the sūtra लट् स्मे seems to belong to the Slokavārttikakāra since mention is made here of Katyayana. In any case it seems that it cannot refer to Bhasyakara. In the second case when it is said that, on the authority of the sutra न बहुव्रीहौ, only the forms स्वत्कपितृकः and मत्कपितृकः can be taken to be correct, we find गोनर्दीयस्त्वाह “ अकच्खरौ तु कर्तव्यौ प्रत्यङ्गं मुक्तसञ्चयी. " Here too it is better to take me to refer to Katyayana or another Värttikakära. It deserves to be noted that the author of the Kāsikā has not mentioned the forms त्वकल्पितृकः and मकत्पितृकः and consequently has not recognised the statement अकच्स्वरौ तु कर्तव्यौ प्रत्यङ्गं मुक्तसञ्चयौ, which gives room to infer that गोनर्दीय here may refer to a Varttikakära other than Katyayana. 
In the third case when it is said that there will be no authority sanctioning the correctness of the word काशकटीकारम् 
xlviii 
in the sentence इच्छाम्यहं काशकटीकारम् we find इष्टमेवैतद्गोनर्दीयस्य. Here too there is no harm if me is taken to refer to a Varttikakāra other than Katyayana and not to Bhāṣyakāra. 
In the fourth case when it is said that the forms afar and fast: have no authority sanctioning their correctness, it is said गोनर्दीय आह 'इष्टमेवैतत् संगृहीतं भवति'. Here too the same thing may hold good as in the third case. 
Taking all this into consideration, it seems to me that met refers to a Varttikakara of the Eastern school. 
There is another argument also which may lend support to this. Vatsyayana, in his Kamasutra quotes on five On one such occasions and ga on eight occasions. occasion while dealing with the number of nayikās he says 
1-5-5. 
1-5-25. 
अन्यकारणवशात् परपरिगृहीतापि पाक्षिकी चतुर्थीति गोणिकापुत्रः 
उत्क्रान्तबालभावाकुलयुवतिरूपचारान्यत्वात् अष्टमीति गोनर्दीयः 
When the number of nayikās according to Gonikaputra is four and that, according to Gonardiya, it is eight, it is not It then possible for both to be one and the same person. follows that both the epithets cannot refer to one person, Patanjali. Besides it is not generally known that Patanjali It is safer therefore to wrote any treatise on Kamasastra. conclude that both Gonikaputra and Gönardiya do not refer to him. 
If it is decided that Gonardiya does not refer to Patanjali, the statement that he is an Eastern grammarian' cannot stand, as also the statement that Katyayana also belonged Cakravarti's to the Eastern country. Parbhatacandra

opinion that he is a Southerner' needs revision. There are strong reasons to believe that Patanjali should have studied under the pupil-descendants of Katyayana. 
It has already been stated that many sutras of Panini are discussed by Katyayana in the form of adhikaranas. To decide which of the varttikas are purvapakṣiya and which of them are siddhantiya is not very easy. It can be easily done if it was handed down from teacher to pupil. In many places Katyāyana states यथा लौकिकवैदिकेषु, यथा लोके, लोकवत्, लोकविज्ञा- नात्सिद्धम्, स्वभावसिद्धत्वात्, धर्मशास्त्रं च तथा etc. Unless it was handed down from teacher to pupil, the applications of the above statements can hardly be easily known. A cursory study of Mahabhasya would convince any one that Patanjali should have studied under Katyayana's disciples or their disciples. 
His range of personal knowledge of geography of India extends to Kashmir on the north, Pataliputra in the east3 and Ujjain on the south. He mentions that Sivapura is a village in the northern country,' that Kastira, Dasarūpya,, Sakala, Sausuka, Patalaprastha, Nandipura, and Kaukkutivaha are villages in Vähika; Sankasya which he mentions there is

He defines - वृत्ति as परार्थाभिधानम् and elassifies it into two :- जहत्स्वार्था वृत्तिः and अजहत्स्वार्था वृत्तिः (M. B. under II-1-1)

He recognises that Panini's grammar deals with words found in all Vedas. 
Cf. सर्ववेदपारिषदं हीदं शास्त्रम् (M. B. under VI-3-14.) 
His keen knowledge of all the four Vedas, Dharmasutras, Srautasutras, Grhyasītras, Itihāsas, Puranas, Purvamimānsā- sutra and Nyayasutra and his intimate knowledge of Srauta- karma and Smarttakarma are patent from the profuse quotations he gives from them. It is elaborately dealt with by Prabhat Candra Cakravarti in the Indian Historical Quarterly Vol. II. His mention of यावक्रीतिकः, प्रैयङ्गविकः, यायातिकः, and वासवदत्तिकः, सौमनोत्तरिकः, ऐतिहासिक, पौराणिकः under IV-2-60 shows that before him Akhyanas, Akhyāyikas, Purana and Itihasas were studied by separate sets of people., His mention of जघान कंसं किल वासुदेवः under the question प्रयोक्तुर्दर्शनविषये इति किमर्थम् ? under (III-2-111) tells us that he witnessed the story of Kamsa-vadha enacted before him. He also says कंसवधमाचष्टे, बलिबन्धमाचष्टे under ITI-1-26. His statement वाररुचं काव्यम्,

Gigent at under IV-3-104 throws light on the existence of Kavyas in his time. The conversation described between a vaiya- karana and a sula under II-4-56 and the expression frafer: clearly tell us that Sanskrit was a spoken language and Patanjali makes his readers understand thro' the conversation that the practice of telling f was prevalent before the time of Patanjali. 
The expression कथं पुनरतस्मिन् स इत्येतद्भवति ? चतुर्भिः प्रकारैर- तस्मिन् स इत्येतद्भवति, तात्स्थ्यात् ताद्धर्म्यात् तत्सामीप्यात् तत्साहचर्यादिति under IV-I-48 and the expression frs: fasofa a आयःशूलिकः । किं चातः ? । शिवभागवते प्राप्नोति under V.2-76 suggest that Patanjali was an advaitin and his upasyadevata was Siva. 
METHOD ADOPTED IN WRITING BHASYA 
Ramabhadra Dikṣita, Prof. Goldstucker, Prof. Keilhorn and others consider that Mahabhaṣya is a commentary on Kalyāyana's Vārtikas. But the author of Sabdakalpadruma saye, परं पतञ्जलिः सूत्रपाठस्य वार्तिकस्य च महाभाष्यं विधाय सर्वतः प्रमाद- परिशून्योऽयं पाणिनीयाष्टाध्यायीग्रन्थ इति प्रदर्शयन् कात्यायनतीव्रदृष्टेः ररक्षेनं समादरणीयं ग्रन्थमुत्तमम् From the tabular statement in p. i it can be seen that out of about 4000 sutras found in the Astadhyayi, about 1700 came to the purview of the Maha- bhasya. Of them about 1200 have under them the värtlikas

2 भोगीन्द्र तेषां भुवि वार्तिकानामशेषविद्वज्जनदुर्गहाणाम् । 
भाष्यं महत्कुर्विति भक्तरक्षी नियोक्ष्यते त्वां किल नीलकण्ठः ॥ (1-63.) 
Mahabhasya...a critical discussion on the Varttikas of Katyayana; while its ishtia, on the other hand, are original värttikas on such sutras of Panini'as called for his own remarks. (Panini-His place in Sanskrit Literature p. 92.) 
The Mahabhasya is, in the first instance, a commentary on 
Katyayana's Varttikas. (Katyayana and Patanjali p. 51.) 
Ixiiiof one Varttikakara, about 25 have under them the varttikas of two or more Varttikakaras and about 425 have no vārttikas but only bhāṣya, (i.e.) about one fourth of the book deals with the interpretation of Bhasyakara on the sutras. Even in sutras which have varttikas under them, there are certain topics like तद्भावितग्रहण in बुद्धिरादैच् which are Patanjali's own. Even among Sivasutras, and have no vārttikas under them. Among 1200 sutras which have varttikas, the varttikas under about 700 are simply explanatory. Patanjali begins with a lucid commentary on the vārtikas more than half of which is in the form of purvapakṣavārtikas and siddhantavärttikas. Whenever he differs from the opinion of the Varttikakära or Varttikakaras, he appends his views at the end. Patanjali almost always agrees with Varttikakaras whenever they deal with the change of words morphologically and semantically. He sometimes refutes the amendment of Katyayana through the instrument of yogavibhāga introduced by Katyayang himself. He gives his own istis and makes very good use of the devices discovered by Katyayana. The spirit of independent thought combined with keen critical acumen and consummate scholarship pervades the whole of the Mahabhasya.

C. Katyāyana's date is considered to be about 350 B. C. Panini is taken by

LECTURES ON PATANJALI'S MAHĀBHĀSYA 
महाभाष्यं वा पठनीयं महाराज्यं वा पालनीयम् ओं नमः पाणिनिकात्यायन पतञ्जलिमहर्षिभ्यो वंशगुरुभ्यो नमो गुरुभ्यः 
INTRODUCTION 
T is now an accepted fact that Grammar follows Lite- rature. The earliest Indian Literature is the Vedas. The Indians considered it their primary duty to preserve them intact. One of the means of preservation was the writing of Grammar and its study. Cf. 
रक्षार्थं वेदानाम् अध्येयं व्याकरणम् (M. B. I. 1, 1) 
That there were nine systems of Grammar is evident from the verse 
सोऽयं नवव्याकरणार्थवेत्ता ब्रह्मा भविष्यत्यपि ते प्रसादात् 
(U. R. 36, 48). 
wherein it is said that Hanuman, the minister of Sugrīva, had a mastery over nine treatises on Grammar. Of them Panini's treatise seems to be the last since Hanuman is said to have studied Sangraha, an elaborate work written by Vyadi in hundred thousand verses based on Panini's Grammar. Cf. 
ससूत्रवृत्त्यर्थपदं महार्थं ससङ्ग्रहं साध्यति वै कपीन्द्रः 
(U. R. 36, 46). 
A grammatical treatise by Indra is mentioned in tradition to have been the first of the nine; but such a treatise does 

[[1]]

not seem to have been mentioned of in any work. The only reference to Indra's being connected with Grammar is found in Mahabhaṣya, where it is said that Indra attempted in vain to make a detailed study, in 1000 divine years, of all the words current, at the feet of the preceptor of the devas. 
बृहस्पतिरिन्द्राय दिव्यं वर्षसहस्रं प्रतिपदोक्तानां शब्दानां शब्दपारायणं प्रोवाच, न चान्तं जगाम । बृहस्पतिश्च प्रवक्ता, इन्द्रय अध्येता, दिव्यं वर्षसहस्रम् अध्ययन- कालः ॥ * 
(M. B. I. 1, 1). 
The revered Panini wrote his work in eight chapters of four padas, each in the form of sutras. Sutras are short sentences, unambiguous, clear and comprehensive. Cf. 
अल्पाक्षरमसन्दिग्धं सारवद्विश्वतोमुखम् । 
अस्तोभमनवद्यं च सूत्रं सूत्रविदो विदुः ॥ 
The invaluable service done by Panini to Sanskrit can well be appreciated only by a close study of his work. The division of his work into two parts, the former comprising the first seven chapters and the first pada of the last and the latter, the last three padas of the last, is an art by itself. The sutras of the latter part are said to be non-existent when those of the former part operate Cf. 
*It may be noted that (1) in the Foreword to Tolkappiyam, the earliest extant Tamil Grammar, we find the statement Aintiram nirainta Tolkäppiyan." (Tolkäppiyan well-versed in Aindra) and (2) under sûtra 74 of collatikaram, Cenävaraiyar says "Aintiranular vili-verrumaiyai ettam-verrumaiyaka nerntar' (The author of the Aindra called the vocative case, the eighth case).

INTRODUCTION 
पूर्वत्रासिद्धम् (P. VIII 2, 1.) 
His work was commented upon in an elaborate treatise consisting of 100000 verses, by Vyadi who was said by my revered guru to have been the grandson of Panini. It was named Sangraha. Unfortunately the work seems to have been lost. We get only stray references to it. Cf. 
सङ्ग्रहे एतत्प्राधान्येन परीक्षितं नित्यो वा स्यात्कार्यों वेति । 
(M. B. I. 1, 1). 
Later on, a large number of grammarians commented upon the sutras of Panini. Their works were called Vārtikas. They have not only elucidated the views of Panini, but also added the explanation of words which became newly current in their times and rejected those that fell out of use. Cf. 
उक्तानुक्तदुरुक्तानां चिन्ता यत्र प्रवर्तते । 
तं ग्रन्थं वार्तिकं प्राहुः वार्तिकज्ञा मनीषिणः ॥ 
It is a sad feature that the names of all of them except one are not now known to us. He is Katyayana by Gotra and Vararuci by name. It is a matter for research whether he is himself the author of the Srauta sutras, Sarvānukramani etc., or different from him. 
Then came Patanjali who is believed by the astikas to have been the incarnation of Adisesa. He wrote his Maha- bhāṣya which is an elaborate treatise dealing with discus- sions on many of the sutras of Panini and the vārtikas of the different Vartikakāras. It is not only a commentary on the sutras and the vārtikas, but also a critical treatise discussing on the necessity of the above sutras and vārtikas. He shows that some of the sutras are not necessary and that their purpose is served by Jñápakas. He sometimes 

[[3]]

disagrees with the criticism of the Vartikakāras against Panini and establishes with forcible arguments the views of Panini. Cf. 
सूत्रार्थो वर्ण्यते यत्र वाक्यैः सूत्रानुसारिभिः 
स्वपदानि च वर्ण्यन्ते भाष्यं भाप्यविदो विदुः ॥ 
The method adopted by him in his arguments is very fine. He proves his point by analogy with nyayas current in the world. 
When there are bhāṣyas for all sastras, why should the bhāṣya of Vyakaraṇa alone be called Mahabhāṣya? This question is answered, by Bhartṛhari and Punyarāja, the commentator on Bhartrhari's Vakyapadiya, that it is not only a treatise on Grammar, but also the fountain-source of all nyāyas. 
कृतेऽथ पतञ्जलिना गुरुणा तीर्थदर्शिना ।

Nagesabhaṭṭa, the renowned all-round veteran scholar of the seventeenth century answers the same question thus: It is not only a commentary, but also a criticism on the sutras and vārtikas, wherein he gives his own views though they do not agree with those of the Sutrakāra and Vārtikakāras. Cf. 
महत्त्वम् 
व्याख्यातृत्वेऽपि अस्य इष्ट्यादिकथनेन अन्वाख्यातृत्वात् इतरभाष्यवैलक्षण्येन 
(M. B. I, 1, 1.) 
INTRODUCTION 
The Mahabhaṣya was used to be read by orthodox Indian grammarians in the same way as the Vedanta- bhāṣyas. The santi that was recited at the beginning was- 
वाक्यकारं वररुचिं भाष्यकारं पतञ्जलिम् । 
पाणिनि सूत्रकारञ्च प्रणतोऽस्मि मुनित्रयम् ॥ 
योगेन चित्तस्य पदेन वाचा मलं शरीरस्य च वैद्यकेन । 
योऽपाकरोतं प्रवरं मुनीनां पतञ्जलिं प्राञ्जलिरानतोऽस्मि || 
From this it is evident that, according to tradition, Patañjali was the author of not only the Mahabhaṣya but also the Yogasutra and a work on Indian medicine. 
Some seem to doubt the identity of the author of the Yogasutra with that of Mahabhāṣya since Vyasa is said to be the commentator of the Yogasutra and he is identical with the author of the Vedantasūtras. Since there is no conclusive proof for the identity of the two Vyasas, it may be taken that Vyasa, the commentator on the Yogasūtra was different from the Badarāyaṇa Vyasa and the two Patanjalis are identical. 
The study of the Mahabhaṣya was closed on the dvadasi with Mangalapatha (since Panini is believed to have left this world on the trayodasi) and commenced again on the dvitiya. On the mangalapatha day mustard and curd were offered to the three munis Panini, Vararuci and Patanjali. 
The Sanskrit scholars had so much regard to Maha- bhāṣya that they said 
महाभाप्यं वा पठनीयं महाराज्यं वा पालनीयम् 

[[5]]

पस्पशाह्निकम् 
The sutras found in the first pada of the first adhyaya of Panini's Astādhyāyī are discussed along with the vārtikas in nine ahnikas. The first ähnika is named paspasahnika. This name should have been at least as old as the time of Magha since he mentions this in one of his verses in the Sisupalavadha. Cf: 
अनुत्सूत्रपदन्यासा सद्वृत्तिः सन्निबन्धना । शब्दविद्येव नो भाति राजनीतिरपस्पशा ॥ 
(Si. II 112) 
The word 
π is derived from the root 
which means 
to refute or to touch upon. This ähnika refutes the argu- ments of others and touches upon the preliminaries of the sastra. The second ähnika is named af since it deals with the pratyāhāra sutras अइउण्, ऋलक्, एओ, etc. From the third ahnika onwards discussions on the sutras commencing with fat are found. 
The topics dealt with in the first ahnika are (1) the commencement of the Sastra, (2) the classification of words, (3) the definition of Sabda, (4) the use of the study of this sastra, (5) the method to be adopted in expounding the sastra, (6) the nityatva (eternity) or the karyatva (transitoriness) of sabda, (7) the need for the sastra on account of its expounding that correct words are needed for Dharma, (8) the meaning of the word 
and (9) the 
need for making use of the pratyāhāra sutras this sastra. 
etc., in

अथ शब्दानुशासनम् । अथेत्ययं शब्दोऽधिकारार्थः प्रयुज्यते, शब्दानुशासनं 
नाम शास्त्रमधिकृतं वेदितव्यम् ॥

PASPASAHNIKA 
The expression 'अथ शब्दानुशासनम्' is a sutra-like sen- tence of the Mahabhāṣyakāra and it is explained by the following sentences 
अथेत्ययं शब्दः अधिकारार्थः प्रयुज्यते— शब्दानुशासनं नाम शास्त्रमधिकृतं वेदितव्यम् 
The 
It means the Sabdanusāsanam commenceth.': Sabdanusāsanam means the science wherein the derivation of words is explained. 
What is the meaning of the word are here? Its mean- ings are stated by the author of Amarakosa thus: 
मङ्गलानन्तरारम्भप्रश्नकात्न्यैष्वथो अथ 
Here it means आरम्भ: (commencement). Then arises the question whether the word a denotes commencement or suggests it, i. e., in other words, whether the word ar is आरम्भवाचक or आरम्भद्योतक. Kaiyata the author of the प्रदीप on महाभाष्य, and Bhattoji Diksit, the author of the Siddhānta- kāumudi, Manorama, Sabdakāustubha etc., hold the former view and Nageśabhaṭṭa, the author of the Uddyota on Mahabhaṣya holds the latter view. The authorities for Nãgesa's view are the kärikä of Bhartṛhari 
निपाता द्योतकाः केचित्पृथगर्थाभिधायिनः । 
आगमा इव केऽपि स्युः सम्भूयार्थस्य वाचकाः ॥ ( V. II 194) 
आगमाइव 
and the under the sutra 
अव्ययं विभक्ति समीप... साकल्यान्तवचनेषु 
(P. II 1.6) 
When the word अथ in 'अथातो धर्मजिज्ञासा', 'अथातो ब्रह्मजिज्ञासा' means आनन्तर्यम् (immediate succession), why should not the same word have the same meaning here? धर्मविचार invari- ably requires the knowledge of the Vedas and hence it 

[[7]]

follows the study of the Vedas. Similarly afar must invariably be preceded by the possession of four requisites:- नित्यानित्यवस्तुविवेकः (discriminating the eternal from the non- eternal), इहामुत्रार्थफलभोगविरागः (averseness from enjoyment here or elsewhere), f (control of the senses etc.) 
and (desire to be relieved of this bondage of mortal life). Hence there has to be taken to mean immediate succession. But, on the other hand, the study of Grammar does not invariably need anything before it. One may doubt the veracity of this statement since the knowledge of literature is considered necessary before one begins to study Grammar. Though it is right to think so, yet he should be made to remember that it is not always the case. 
If the word ar suggests commencement, one may think that it may be discarded since the word gareng alone may suggest it. This is answered by Käiyata thus- 
यते 
अनेकक्रियाविषयस्यापि शब्दानुशासनस्य प्रारभ्यमाणता अथशब्दसन्निधाने प्रती- 
(The use of the word sabdanusāsanam alone may enable one to interpret it as sabdānusāsanam śruyate, kriyate etc.) The word अथ shows that it means शब्दानुशासनमारभ्यते. If one thinks that the above doubt may be cleared by the expres- sion अधिकृतं in the विवरणभाष्य, he may be answered that the word not only serves this purpose but also indicates another meaning. 
It indicates auspiciousness (mangala). It has been the practice of Indian writers to invoke the blessings of God at the commencement of their work so that the work may see its end without any difficulty. This is done either by writing verses in the form of prayer or by using word or words that indicate it. Just as the sound of drums indicates 
8 
PASPASÁHNIKA 
the marriage in a house, so also the word atha is taken to indicate mangala since it is considered to be one of the two words that first emanated from the mouth of Brahma, the Creator. Cf. 
ओंकारश्चाथशब्दश्च द्वावेतौ ब्रह्मणः पुरा । 
कण्ठं भित्त्वा विनिर्यातौ तस्मान्माङ्गलिकावुभौ || 
The reason why Patañjali indicated mangala without actually giving expression to it in the form of prayer may be that Panini, the Sutrakāra and Vararuci, the Vartikakāra have indicated mangala and not expressed it by the words वृद्धिः and सिद्ध respectively in the first sutra वृद्धिरादैच् and the first vārtika 
सिद्धे शब्दार्थसम्बन्धे लोकतोऽर्थत्रयुक्ते शब्दप्रयोगे शास्त्रेण धर्मनियमः 
It was stated that the expression 
अथेत्ययं शब्दोऽधिकारार्थः प्रयुज्यते, शब्दानुशासनं नाम शास्त्रमधिकृतं वेदितव्यम् is विवरणभाष्यम्. The word इति is used here so that the word atha here means the word and not its meaning. Cf. 
इतिशब्दः पदार्थविपर्यासकृत्. 
When one says रामः रावणं जघान, the word Ramal means the person Rāma ; but, on the other hand, if one says 
राम इति तस्य नाम 
the word Rama means the word Rama made up of the two letters and #. 
Since Panini, the Sutrakāra has stated in his sutra 

[[9]]

स्वं रूपं शब्दस्याशब्दसंज्ञा (P. I.1, 68) 
(that in his work a word means its form and not its mean- ing) and since the Mahabhaṣya is a work on grammar, one may think that the word 'iti' in the Vivarana bhashya is not necessary. But Patañjali by his use of iti here suggests that Panini's tenet 
स्वं रूपं शब्दस्याशब्दसंज्ञा 
does not hold good here. 
The use of the word ayam after the word iti is to make the readers think of atha in the preceding sentence atha sabdanusasanam and not elsewhere as in atha yoganu- sasanam. Patanjali is not sparing in words. Though the word sabda is not necessary since the word iti suggests that atha denotes the word atha, he has used it so that it may be easily understood by the readers. 
The word adhikara means commencement. The deriva- tion of sabdanusāsanam is sabdānām anusasanam and that of anusasanam is 
अनुशिष्यन्ते, असाधुशब्देभ्यो विविच्य ज्ञाप्यन्ते, साधुशब्दाः अनेन 
The suffix ana in sabdanusasanam denotes instrument and hence the word sabdanusasanam means Grammar. The use of the sixth case in sabdānām anusasanam is on the authority of the sutra 
कर्तृकर्मणोः कृति (P. II. 3. 65 ) 
and not, since otherwise the samāsa sabdaānu- śāsanam would be prevented by the sutra कर्मणि च. 
Hence the sentence atha sabdanusasanam means 'the Grammar commenceth'. Its statement instead of Vya- 
10 
PASPAS'AHNIKA 
karanasāstram arabhyate serves the following purposes: (1) mangalam is indicated by atha (2) sabda is the visaya (topic for discussion) in this work (3) the knowledge of the derivation of sabda by the readers is the aim of this work and (4) those who are eager to learn Grammar are fit to study it. 
Readers can completely comprehend the meaning of the sentence atha sabdanusāsanam only if they are fully aware of the connotation and the denotation of the words which make it up. The meaning of atha has been explained by the Bhāṣyakara himself and the meaning of anusasanam is learnt from the meaning of the root sus which is found in the dhatupatha and the meaning of the suffix ana from the sutra. 
करणाधिकरणयोध (P. III, 3, 117). 
But neither the denotation nor the connotation of sabda is clear to the reader. Hence Mahābhāṣyakāra goes to the next topic which deals with the classification of sabda. 
II 
केषां शब्दानाम् ? लौकिकानां वैदिकानाञ्च । 
तत्र लौकिकास्तावत्, गौरवः पुरुषो हस्ती शकुनिर्मृगो ब्राह्मण इति । वैदिकाः खल्वपि शन्नो देवीरभिष्टये ; इवे त्वोर्जे त्वा ; अ॒ग्निर्मीले पुरोहितम् ; अन आयाहि वीतये इति ॥ 
Of which sabdas? Of those current in the world and in the Vedas. Among them the laukika sabdas are : (cow), अश्वः (horse), पुरुषः (person), हस्ती ( elephant ), शकुनि: (bird), मृग: (deer), a: (brāhmaṇa) etc. The Vaidika sabdas are ra [Let the waters bring us happiness (so that we may perform sacrifice)]; [(I cut) you for food and vitality]; a gua (I invoke Agni, the divine priest);

1 
What is the need for this question hair? Kaiyaṭa and Nagōji Bhaṭṭa differ in their answer on this point. The former is of opinion that since the word sabda denotes not only the words of human speech but also cries of birds, animals etc., Mahabhaṣyakāra wants to inform the readers clearly that it denotes only speech-words here. In that case one may think that the answer gar would have been more appropriate. Had that answer been given, it may not make the readers understand clearly that sabda denotes Vaidika expressions also and it may even enable them to mistake that sabda denotes apasabdas (incorrect expres- sions) also. Nägōji Bhaṭṭa feels, on the other hand, that this question is intended to inform the readers that sabda here denotes not only the laukika sabda but also the Vaidika sabda, and thus enable them to understand that Panini does not deal in his grammar only with laukika sabdas as in शाकटायनव्याकरणम्, nor only with Vaidika sabdas as in प्रातिशाख्य, but with both. 
Since the Vedas form part of the world, the Vaidika sabdas form a part of the laukika sabdas. Then what is the need for the expression Vaidikānam ca? The need is felt since the author wants to give prominence to the Vaidika sabda. The expression Vaidikanam ca here is similar to the expression Vasisthopi in the sentence ब्राह्मणा आगताः वसिष्ठोऽप्यागतः (Brāhmanas have come and also Vasistha ). The expression Vasisthopi does not preclude Vasistha from being a Brahmana, but suggests that he is the Brahmana of Brahmaņas. The Vaidika sabdas are considered to be more prominent than the laukika sabdas, since the latter should not be mispronounced only in sacrifices (for) and the 
12 
PASPASAHNIKA 
former on no occasion. Or it may be taken that Maha- bhāsyakāra may have stated लौकिकानां वैदिकानां च similar to the statements of Panini छन्दसि च (V. 1. 61), भाषायां सदवसश्रुवः (III. 2. 108). 
The laukika sabdas are illustrated by :, :, etc. It is worthy of note that the list of words given by Yäska in his Nirukta commences with the same words, 
सत्वानामुपदेशः । गौरवः पुरुषो हस्तीति । (N. 1, 1,2) 
The Vaidika sabdas are illustrated by the sentences ar afre etc. This clearly shows that, in Vedas, the order of words should not be changed, that they should be pro- nounced with their respective svara and that the sentence accent is more powerful than the word accent. 
The four sentences mentioned above शनो देवीरभिष्ट॑ये, हुपे त्योर्जे त्या, अग्निमीले पुरोहितम्, अग्न आयाहि वीतये respectively represent the Atharvaveda, the Yajurvēda, the Rgveda and the Sama- veda. It may be a surprise to the Brahmanas to see that the order is inverted here since they have been accustomed to repeat them in a different order while they perform their Brahmayajua. The order that they follow then is af पुरोहितम् इषे त्योर्जे त्या अग्न आर्याहि वीतये शनो देवीरभिष्ट॑ये. Hence it is necessary to infer some reason or other for this inversion. 
From Dharmasutras it is plain that those that are authorised to study the Vedas have to study all the Vedas. If it is not practicable, they are allowed to study two or at least one. Cf. 
वेदानधीत्य वेदौ वा वेदं वापि यथाक्रमम् । 
fararaar गृहस्थाश्रममावसेत् ॥ (M. III. 2) 

[[3]]

It may also be noted that there were people who studied all the four Vedas in forty-eight years. Cf. 
अष्टाचत्वारिंशद्वर्षाणि पौराणां वेदब्रह्मचर्यम् (B.D. I. 2. 1). 
அறுநான் கிரட்டி யிளமை கல்லியாண்டு ஆறினிற் கழிப்பிய வறனவில் கொள்கை 
இருபிறப் பாளர் பொழுதறிந்து நுவல 
B.. (179-82) 
If one is prepared to study all the Vedas the injunction 
स्वाध्यायोऽध्येतव्यः 
says that he should first study the Veda which was first studied by his forefathers. Otherwise he is said to become a sinner. Cf. 
पारंपर्यागतो येषां वेदस्सपरिबृंहणः । 
तच्छाखाकर्म कुर्वीत तच्छाखाध्ययनं तथा ॥ 
यः स्वशाखां परित्यज्य पारक्यमधिगच्छति । 
स शूद्रवद्बहिष्कार्य सर्वकर्मसु साधुभिः ॥ (Y.) 
Hence it seems to me that Mahābhāṣyakāra studied the Atharvaveda first and then the Yajurveda, the Rgvéda and the Samaveda. This is also supported by the fact that on another occasion when he says that students repeat the Vedas as taught to them without questioning the why of it, he mentions 
ओं इत्युक्त्वा वृत्तान्तशः शमित्येवमादीन् शब्दान् पठन्ति (M. B. I. 1. 1) 
14 
PASPASAHNIKA 
Mahamahopadhyaya Pandit Śivadatta D. Kudala, the editor of the Mahabhaṣya which was published by Tuka- rama Javaji writes in the foot-note under this portion that the Atharvaveda is mentioned first since the Brahma, one of the four principal priests of a sacrifice, is to be conversant with all the Vedas and he should know how to avert diffi- culties both from within and from without, for which the knowledge of the Atharvaveda is necessary. Since ar: is mentioned immediately after Brahma the Yajurveda is mentioned next and since the Sama is based upon, the Rgveda is mentioned next. He gives also an alternative explanation that the Atharvaveda is mentioned first since it is stated in Mundakopaniṣad that Brahma first taught his eldest son Atharva, the Brahmavidya. Cf. 
ब्रह्मा देवानां प्रथमं सम्बभूव विश्वस्य कर्ता भुवनस्य गोप्ता, 
स ब्रह्मविद्यां सर्वविद्याप्रतिष्ठामथर्वाय ज्येष्ठपुत्राय प्राह । 
शनो देवीरभिष्टये which is generally stated to represent the Atharvaveda is only the first Rk of the sixth sukta in the first kända of the Atharvaveda; while 
ये त्रिषप्ताः परियन्ति विश्वा रूपाणि विभ्रतः । 
वाचस्पतिर्बला तेषां तन्वोअद्य दधातु मे ॥ 
happens to be the first Rk of the first sukta in the Atharva- vēda. I am unable to understand why at free is pre- ferred to ये त्रिषप्ताः परियन्ति, though इषे त्वोर्जे त्वा, अग्निमीले पुरोहितम् अग्न आयाहि वीतये are at the commencement of the Yajurveda, the Rgveda and the Samaveda respectively. 
Having thus dealt with the denotation of the word sabda, Mahābhāṣyakara begins to deal with its connota- tion.

Now, when one says nr:, what is sabda? Is it the object which has the dew-lap, tail, hump, hoof, horns etc.? No, he says, it is called dravya. Is it then its gesture, movement or winking? No, he says, it is called kriya or action. Is it then the whiteness, blueness, brownness, or greyness ? No, he says; it is called guna. Is it then the sum-total of the qualities like satta which ever exists even when the individuals are broken or destroyed ? No, he says, it is called akrti. Then what is sabda? Sabda is that on whose manifestation the correct knowledge of the object which has dew-lap, tail, hump, hoof, horns etc., is produced; or, the sound which has a decisive meaning is said to be sabda in the world. It is clear from the fact that he who makes noise is told thus : Make sabda!' 'Do not make sabda. student is a maker of sabda. Hence dhvani is sabda. 
This 
When a word like : is pronounced, the following con- cepts appear in the mind of the hearer:-the species cow, her action, her qualities, genus cow, the shape of the cow-and also the word made up of g, au and visarga strikes his ear. The hearer begins to doubt whether on pronouncing : the 
16 
PASPASAHNIKA 
sabda refers to the species cow, her actions etc. It may seem absurd to some to think so since the species cow, her qualities etc., are seen by the eyes and the word : is heard by the ear. But since the relation of and ar, and गुणिन्, क्रिया and क्रियावान् in Sanskrit is identity according to the Sanskrit grammarians and there is a rule agrarfraer aafar, it is quite natural to think so. Mahabhāṣyakāra says that they are not the connotation of sabda and the true connotation is :-that, which, when manifested, enables the hearer to have a clear knowledge of the object cow. 
Is it not then the sound that strikes the ear? At first he says 'no' for the following reasons:-In words made up of more than one letter, if one letter is capable of giving the sense of the whole word, the other letters are unnecessary. If, on the other hand, the whole made up of all letters is considered to be capable of giving the sense, it is not possi- ble to have the whole pronounced at the same time. Hence the Sanskrit grammarians say that every letter that is pronounced makes an impression in the mind and the sum- total of the impressions made by all the letters of the word suggest the sense. Hence sabda is not what we hear, but it is that which is manifested in the mind after the whole word is pronounced. 
It may be useful in this context to mention that the Sanskrit grammarians state that sabda is of four phases :- परा, (para), पश्यन्ती, (pasyanti ), मध्यमा, (madhyama) and वैखरी (vaikhari), para being that phase of the e, the un- differentiated primordial sound manifested at rar, or sacral plexus, pasyanti being that phase which is mani- fested at the navel and which is cognisable to yōgins, madhyama being that phase which is manifested at the heart and väikhari being that phase which is manifested 

[[3]]

out of the vocal organs as the articulated sound. These four phases are clearly suggested by the following Rk men- tioned in the Mahabhāṣya and the following karika found in Bhartrhari's Vākyapadiya:- 
चत्वारि वाक्परिमिता पदानि तानि विदुर्ब्राह्मणा ये मनीषिणः । गुहा त्रीणि निहिता नेङ्गत्यन्ति तुरीयं वाचो मनुष्या वदन्ति ॥ 
वैखर्या मध्यमायाश्च पश्यन्त्याश्चैतदद्भुतम् । 
(M. B. I. 1. 1.) 
अनेकतीर्थभेदायास्त्रय्या वाचः परं पदम् ॥ (V. I. 144). 
Nāgoji Bhaṭṭa says that the definition 
येनोच्चारितेन सास्नालाङ्गूलककुदखुरविषाणिनां सम्प्रत्ययो जायते स शब्दः 
applies to madhyamā and the definition प्रतीतपदार्थको ध्वनिः शब्दः applies to vaikhari. Cf. 
ध्वनिपदेनात्र वैखरी, स्फोटपदेनाभिव्यक्तकत्वादिको मध्यमावस्थ आन्तरः शब्द उच्यते 
Even though that 
येनोच्चारितेन सास्नालाङ्गूलककुदखुरविषाणिनां सम्प्रत्ययो जायते स शब्दः 
is the true definition of a word, yet Mahābhāṣyakāra sug- gests another definition also which is current in the world. 
The statements शब्दं कुरु मा शब्दं कार्षीः, शब्दकार्ययं माणवकः are taken by Kaiyata to be विधिः (injunction) निषेध, (prohibition), and वस्तुस्थितिकथनम् (statement of actual fact ). But all the three may be pronounced with the same purpose to silence a noisy boy. There is no doubt that in that case शब्दं कुरु and शब्दकार्ययं माणवकः will have to be pronounced in a parti- cular tone, the former in a sarcastic tone and the latter in a complaining tone. If one begins to question why he should give expression to three sentences which have the same 
18 
PASPASAHNIKA 
meaning, the answer is that Mahābhāṣyakāra takes plea- sure in such statements :- Cf. 
धर्माय नियमः, धर्मार्थो वा नियमः, धर्मप्रयोजनो वा नियमः 
वृत्तये समवायः, वृत्त्यर्थो वा समवायः, वृत्तिप्रयोजनो वा समवायः 
(M.B. I. 1-1.) 
The word atha in अथ गौरित्यत्र कः शब्दः introduces the ques- tion गौरित्यत्र कः शब्दः ; hence Nāgoji Bhatta says पृच्छयते इति शेषः । यत्तत् is used in the sense of यत्. The use of the neuter in and the use of the masculine in : is sanctioned by the statement 
उद्दिश्यमानप्रतिनिर्दिश्यमानयोरेकत्वमापादयन्ति सर्वनामानि पर्यायेण तल्लिङ्गमुपाददते । 
(K. I. 1. 1.) 
The statement भिन्नेष्वभिनम् suggests the oneness and the all-pervasiveness and छिनेष्वच्छिन्नम् suggests the perpetuity. 
The word सामान्यभूतम् is taken by Kaiyata in the sense सामान्यमिव. But since the word सामान्य here denotes सत्ता the व्यापकजातिः, and आकृति: is the व्याप्यजातिः and there can be no comparison between two things that are व्यापक and व्याप्य Nagöji Bhatta takes it to mean सामान्यस्वरूपम्, and he quotes a similar use of bhuta in Mahābhāsya प्रमाणभूत आचार्य:, (I. 1. 3.) in support of his interpretation, 
The word ara: here means not only genus, but also shape. Wherever Mahabhaṣyakara deals with the word आकृति:, he takes it in both the senses. Cf. 
... 
आकृतिर्हि नित्या द्रव्यमनित्यम् द्रव्यं हि नित्यम्, आकृतिरनित्या (M.B. I. 1. 1) आकृतिग्रहणात्सिद्धम् 
(M.B. I. 1. 2.) 
..

The authority for his taking shape also to be the sense of आकृति is the sūtra of Gäutama व्यक्त्याकृतिजातयः पदार्थः

Unless one is informed of the advantages to be derived from doing a thing, one is not generally inclined to do it.* 
So the question arises 
कानि पुनः शब्दानुशासनस्य प्रयोजनानि ? 
What then are the advantages derived from the study of grammar and what is the authority that enjoins it? Here the word agree, though it means 'of grammar," should be taken to mean 'of the study of grammar (GT- ध्ययनस्य.) 
The word means not only the benefits' but also the authorities that enjoin' (a). In both the meanings the derivation of the word प्रयोजनम् is प्रयुज्यते अनेन. Käiyața under this line says 
किं सन्ध्योपासनादिवत् व्याकरणाध्ययनं नित्यं कर्म अथ काम्यमिति प्रश्नः 
It means that the question is whether the study of grammar is a nitya-karma like morning and evening ablutions (sandhyopasana) or kamya-karma. Nitya-karma is that, the performance of which is not considered to bear positive fruit and the non-performance of which is considered to pro- duce demerit. Kamya-karma, on the other hand, is that, 
प्रयोजनमनुद्दिश्य न मन्दोऽपि प्रवर्तते । 
(Even a fool does not attempt a thing for nothing). 
20 
PASPAS'AHNIKA 
the performance of which bears the desired fruit and the non-performance does not bring any demerit. 
The above question is answered thus:-- 
रक्षोहागमलध्वसन्देहाः प्रयोजनम् 
The advantages are (1) [protection (of the Vedas)], (2)[modification (of Vedic mantras)], (3) [easy means (of acquiring the knowledge of words)], and (4) area: (absence of ambiguity) and the authority is : (Vedas). 
It is worthy of note that the compound word रक्षोहागम- लघ्वसन्देहाः is in the plural and the word प्रयोजनम् is in the singular. Such a usage is sanctioned by the statement एकवच अस्य अन्यतरस्याम् (its use in singular is optional) in the 
sutra

रक्षार्थं वेदानामध्येयं व्याकरणम् । लोपागमवर्णविकारज्ञो हि सम्यग्वेदान्परिपालयिष्यतीति ॥ 
To protect the Vedas, grammar is to be studied. For, only he who has a correct knowledge of the elision, the augmentation and the substitution of sounds is thoroughly capable of preserving the Vedas intact. For instance, in the Vedic expression erg (gods milked), the regular form अदुहत is replaced by अदुह where त has been elided and been augmented. Similarly in the expression 3 
has far 
(V. S. 17, 64) is substituted for . One who is not con- 
versant with the rules of grammar which sanction such usages may have a tendency to correct them. 
*This is according to the descriptive grammar; for according to the historical grammar had as one of its sources.

ऊहः खल्बपि - 
न सर्वैर्लिङ्गेन च सर्वाभिर्विभक्तिभिर्वेदे मन्त्रा निगदिताः । ते चावश्यं यज्ञगतेन पुरुषेण यथायथं विपरिणमयितव्याः, तान्नावैयाकरणः शक्नोति यथायथं विपरिणमयितुम् । तस्मादध्येयं व्याकरणम् । 
Modification also (is one of the advantages). Mantras are not mentioned in the Vedas in all genders and cases. They have to be necessarily modified by the priest in a sacrifice according to the context (i.e.) to suit the particular god or gods invoked. It is not possible for a non-gram- marian to suitably modify them. Hence is the need to study 
grammar. 
For instance there is a mantra अग्नये त्वा जुटं निर्वपामि (V. S. I. 13. 2) in the Yajurveda. It is evident that this mantra should be pronounced when the deity to be invoked is Agni. If one is eager of getting ब्रह्मवर्चसम् (lustre of Brah- man), there is an injunction that the oblation must be offered to the sun. Cf : सौर्य चरुं निर्वपेत् ब्रह्मवर्चसकामः । In that case the word अग्नये will have to be replaced by the word सूर्याय. This is possible only if he knows that the dative case singu- lar of सूर्य is सूर्याय. Hence the knowledge of ऊह is necessary for the correct performance of Vedic ceremonies. From this one can understand that helps the яr or the sacrificer to reap the desired fruit and the for the priest to become happy through the fee he is paid for officiating as priest. Nägöji Bhatta seems to think of the latter alone. Cf. ऊहज्ञस्य हि आर्त्विज्यलाभेन द्रव्यप्राप्तिद्वारा ऐहिकसुखसिद्धिः फलमिति बोध्यम् 
आगमः खल्वपि 
ब्राह्मणेन निष्कारणो धर्मः षडङ्गो वेदोऽध्येयो ज्ञेयश्च । प्रधानं च षडङ्गेषु व्याकरणम्। प्रधाने च कृतो यत्नः फलवान्भवति ॥

āgama also [forms a प्रयोजनम् (प्रयोजकम् )]. 
Věda with six angas shall be studied and understood by a Brāhmaṇa without expecting any reward. Of the six angas, grammar is important. Effort directed towards the prominent bears rich fruit. 
The word a suggests that the study of grammar is a nitya-karma to Brāhmaṇas and a kamya-karma to others. The word in for: means not cause, but fruit. The six angas are शिक्षा (Phonetics), व्याकरणम् (Grammar), छन्दः (Prosody), निरुक्तम् (Vedic interpretation), ज्योतिषम् (Astronomy) and : (The made-easies for the performance of rituals). 
Grammar is said to be important since, without its study, one is not capable of understanding the meaning of sen- 
tences. 
The word agama has been taken to mean veda and hence the word prayojana has to be interpreted as prayo- jaka. Since agama means also study and it is used in that sense by Mahābhāṣyakāra himself ( 
I. 1. 1.) and 
the study of Vyakarana is considered to be a nitya-karma to Brahmanas, it seems to me to be worthy of consideration whether Mahābhāṣyakāra intends that the study of Vya- karana for its own sake is one of the prayojanas. 
लघु- 
लघ्वर्थं चाध्येयं व्याकरणम् । ब्राह्मणेनावश्यं शब्दा ज्ञेया इति । न चान्तरेण व्याकरणं लघुनोपायेन शब्दाः शक्या विज्ञातुम् । 
For easy grasp of words is grammar to be studied. Words should necessarily be understood by Brahmanas. There is no easy means of learning words other than grammar. 

[[3]]

If the paradigm of one noun is known, the case-forms of similar nouns are also known and hence there is no need to get by heart the forms of all nouns. Similarly if the conju- gational forms of one verb is known, those of similar verbs are also known. 
असन्देह:- 
असन्देहार्थं चाप्यध्येयं व्याकरणम् । याज्ञिकाः पठन्ति-स्थूलपृषतीमाग्निवारुणी- मनड्वाहीमालभेत इति । तस्यां सन्देहः –— स्थूला चासौ पृषती च स्थूलपृपती, स्थूलानि वा पृषन्ति यस्याः सेयं स्थूलपृषतीति । तां नावैयाकरणः स्वरतोऽध्यवस्यति- यदि पूर्वपदप्रकृतिस्वरत्वं ततो बहुव्रीहिः, अथ समासान्तोदात्तत्वं ततस्तत्पुरुष इति ॥ 
For the absence of ambiguity is grammar to be studied. Mantras dealing with sacrifices are read thus:- 
Tie to the stake to propitiate Agni and Varuna a cow which is quat. Here is the doubt whether the word * means 'stout and spotted,' or 'having big spots.' The correct meaning cannot be understood by a non-gram- marian from its svara. If it has the udattu at the usual place of the first member of the compound, it should be taken as bahuvrihi when, it means 'having big spots'; if, on the other hand, it has the udatta at the final syllable, it should be taken as tatpuruşa when, it means stout and spotted.' 
Having dealt with the advantages of the study of gram- mar in a general way, Mahābhāṣyakāra enumerates them in detail. Kaiyața says: 
Having mentioned the important benefits, he mentions those that are accessory." Nägōji Bhatta explains that they 
# मुख्यानि प्रयोजनानि प्रदश्यनुषङ्गिकाणि प्रदर्शयति 
24 
PASPAS'AHNIKA 
are important because they are intended to get a knowledge of words and their meanings and the others are accessory since they deal with incorrect words and the usage of words in proper places etc.* 
इमानि च भूयः शब्दानुशासनस्य प्रयोजनानि - तेऽसुराः । दुष्टः शब्दः । यदधीतम् । यस्तु प्रयुङ्क्ते । अविद्वांसः । विभक्तिं कुर्वन्ति । यो वा इमाम् । चत्वारि उत त्वः । सक्तुमिव । सारस्वतीम् । दशम्यां पुत्रस्य । सुदेवो असि वरुण । इति 
These also are the benefits to be accrued by the study of grammar, तेऽसुराः etc. 
The expression तेऽसुराः etc., are generally at the com - mencement of some Vedic texts which are explained in detail below. They are thirteen in number. 
तेऽसुराः- 
तेऽसुरा हेऽलयो हेऽलय इति कुर्वन्तः पराबभूवुः । तस्माद् ब्राह्मणेन न म्लेच्छितवै, नापभाषितवै, म्लेच्छो ह वा एष यदपशब्दः । म्लेच्छा मा भूमेत्यध्येयं व्याकरणम् । [तेऽसुराः] + 
Those asuras pronouncing helayah helayah 
baffled in their attempt. Hence no mleccha word is to be pronounced by a Brahmana; (i.e.) no word not sanctioned by grammar is to be pronounced; mleccha means word which is not sanctioned by grammar. In order that we may not become mlecchas (the users of corrupt words), grammar is to be studied. 
तेषां प्रधानत्वं च पदपदार्थज्ञानाधीनत्वेनान्तरङ्गत्वात् । वक्ष्यमाणानां च बहिरङ्गशब्दापशब्द- प्रयोगविधिनिषेधविषयत्वादानुषङ्गिकत्वं बोध्यम् । 
+ ते अमुराः indicates that the topic dealing with it is closed. The same method is followed in दुष्टः शब्दः etc. 

[[5]]

The expression हेऽलयो हेऽलयः is the incorrect one that is referred to. The mistakes here are according to some, the non-use of pluta and prakrtibhāva (i.e.) हेऽलयो हेऽलयः should have been pronounced as हे ३ अलयः हे ३ अलय: Others think that the correct form is हे हे अरयः 
On considering the use of the word it appears that the statement 
तेऽसुरा हेऽलयो हेऽलय इति कुर्वन्तः परावभूवुः । तस्माद् ब्राह्मणेन न म्लेच्छितवै । 
is a quotation from some previous work. The expression a म्लेच्छितवै is explained by Mahābhāsyakāra by न अपभाषितवै. The reason for such an interpretation is said that the word म्लेच्छः is freely used to denote ungrammatical word or ex- pression. The word म्लेच्छाः may also mean 'censured be- ings.' Bhartrhari in his Pradipikā says that तेऽसुराः ... is an arthavāda and म्लेच्छा मा भूम means, according to some, मा पराभूम. 
दुष्टः शब्दः । 
दुष्टः शब्दः स्वरतो वर्णतो वा मिथ्याप्रयुक्तो न तमर्थमाह । स वाग्वज्रो यजमानं हिनस्ति यथेन्द्रशत्रुः स्वरतोऽपराधात् ॥ इति दुष्टान् शब्दान् मा प्रयुक्ष्महीत्यध्येयं व्याकरणम् [दुष्टः शब्दः ] 
Word that is incorrectly pronounced either from the standpoint of svara (accent) or varna ( letter) gives the non- desired meaning and hence is not able to convey the desired 
तत्र केचिदाहुः " है हेप्रयोगे हैहयोः" इति लुते प्रकृतिभावे च कर्तव्ये तदकरणं म्लेच्छन-

meaning. It serves as speech-thunderbolt and brings out the ruin of the sacrificer as the word which was pro- nounced with a wrong accent. In order that we may not use wrong words, grammar is to be studied. 
The allusion referred to is this:-Vrtra, an asura, want- ed to bring forth a son who could kill Indra, his foe. So he performed a sacrifice in which he pronounced the mantra which means may you, Indrasatru flourish.' Here the word is capable of giving two meanings:- the slayer of Indra and one who could be slain by Indra. If it should convey the former meaning, the last syllable is to be accented and if it is the latter, the word should be 
accented in its usual place. Vrtra wanted only the slayer of Indra. But, while pronouncing the mantra, he pronounced the word : in hot haste by accenting it on the first syllable of the word Indra. The result was that he got a son who could be slain by Indra. 
This stanza seems to be an adaptation of the following stanza found in the पाणिनीयशिक्षा । 
मन्त्रो हीनः स्वरतो वर्णतो वा मिथ्याप्रयुक्तो न तमर्थमाह । 
स वाग्वज्रो यजमानं हिनस्ति यथेन्द्रशत्रुः स्वरतोऽपराधात् ॥ 
A doubt may arise why the incorrect pronunciation of words should bring out the destruction of the sacrificer and not the officiating priest though it is the latter who actually mispronounces the word. Since the priest is only paid for it, neither the gain accrued by the correct pronunciation, nor the loss accrued by the incorrect pronunciation is con- sidered to affect him. 
The enumeration of तेऽसुराः and दुष्टः शब्दः is to make the Brahmanas realise that, if they are ignorant of grammar, 

[[7]]

they will be disqualified to officiate as priests in sacrifices, If, in spite of their ignorance, they are chosen, they will be instrumental in bringing ruin to the sacrificer who chooses them. 
यदधीतम् — 
यदधीतमविज्ञातं निगदेनैव शब्द्यते 1 
अनग्नाविव शुष्कैधो न तज्ज्वलति कर्हिचित् ॥ 
तस्मादनर्थकं माधिगीष्महीत्यध्येयं व्याकरणम् [ यदधीतम् ] । 
That which is studied (at the feet of the preceptor) and is often repeated as was taught by him without its meaning being understood does not shine (i.e. is of no practical utility) like dry fuel thrown on ashes. In order that we may not study anything without advantage, the knowledge of grammar is necessary. 
From this it is evident that there is no use of studying anything without understanding its sense. Much more is it so with respect to the study of the Vedas. That Maha- bhāṣyakāra cites this only with special reference to the study of the Vedas is seen from the fact that this stanza with a slight modification forms the supplement, in Nirukta, to the stanza 
स्थाणुरयं भारहारः किलाभूदेवीत्य वेदं न विजानाति योऽर्थम् । 
योऽर्थज्ञ इत्सकलं भद्रमश्नुते नाकमेति ज्ञानविधूतपाप्मा । ( N. I. 6. 2.) 
It means this:-He who studies Veda without knowing its meaning is evidently a pillar serving as rest for loads; but, on the other hand, he who understands the meaning gets all kinds of happiness and reaches Heaven after having his sins removed with his knowledge. 
The Nirukta reading is यद्गृहीतम् instead of यदधीतम्.

यस्तु प्रयुङ्क्ते कुशलो विशेषे शब्दान्यथावद् व्यवहारकाले । 
सोऽनन्तमाप्नोति जयं परत्र वाम्योगविद् दुष्यति चापशब्दैः || 
The learned grammarian who uses the right word in the right place gets unbounded success elsewhere, while the other man (the non-grammarian) fares ill by the use of incorrect words. 
Mahābhāṣyakāra evokes a discussion on the subject of the verb दुष्यति. The पूर्वपक्ष is that वाग्योगवित् which im- mediately precedes दुष्यति is its subject and the सिद्धान्त is that अवारयोगवित् is understood before दुष्यति and it alone can form its subject. The discussion runs as follows:- 
क:- Who? 
वाग्योगविदेव – Evidently the grammarian ! 
कुत एतत् - On what authority is this? 
यो हि शब्दान् जानाति अपशब्दानप्यसौ जानाति यथैव हि शब्दज्ञाने धर्मः एवम् अपशब्दज्ञानेऽपि अधर्मः । अथ वा भूयानधर्मः प्राप्नोति — भूयांसोऽपशब्दाः, अल्पीयांसः शब्दाः, एकैकस्य हि शब्दस्य बहवोऽपभ्रंशाः । तद्यथा गौरित्यस्य शब्दस्य गावी गोणी गोता गोपोतलिका इत्येवमादयो अपभ्रंशाः ॥ 
For he who knows the correct words knows also incorrect ones. As merit accrues with the knowledge of correct words, demerit also accrues with that of incorrect words. Or, the greater becomes the demerit since the incorrect words are greater in number; for every correct word is mispronounced in many ways; for instance the correct word : (which denotes cow) is mispronounced in many ways like गावी, गोणी, गोता, गोपोतलिका etc. (It must be borne in mind that the word off when it means a sack is correct). 

[[9]]

अथ योऽवाम्योगवित् ? – Then what about the non-gram- marian ? 
अज्ञानं तस्य शरणम् – Ignorance is his resort. 
विषम उपन्यासः । नात्यन्ताय अज्ञानं शरणं भवितुमर्हति । यो ह्यजानन् वै ब्राह्मणं हन्यात् सुरां वा पिवेत्, सोऽपि मन्ये पतितः स्यात् । 
Illogical is the argument. Ignorance cannot completely serve as a resort. He who murders a Brāhmaṇa, or who drinks liquor without knowing that either brings forth sin is, I think, a sinner. 
एवं तर्हि, सोऽनन्तमाप्नोति जयं परत्र वाग्योगवित् ; दुप्यति चापशब्दैः । 
(Here it must be understood that he reads it in such a way as to stop after an so that it may be taken as the sub- ject of arrafa in the previous line). 
If so सोऽनन्तम् ............अपशब्दः । 
5:? Who? 
अवाग्योगविदेव – Evidently the non-grammarian. 
अथ यो वाग्योगवित् ? Then, what about the grammarian ? विज्ञानं तस्य शरणम् – Knowledge is his resort. 
- 
क पुनरिदं पठितम् – Is there any book where this is said ? भ्राजा नाम श्लोकाः – The slokas named bhrāja. 
किं च भोः श्लोका अपि प्रमाणम् ? Oh sir, do ślōkas also stand as authority ? 
किं चातः ? What if ? 
यदि श्लोका अपि प्रमाणम्, अयमपि प्रमाणं भवितुमर्हति-

पीतं न गमयेत्स्वर्ग किं तत्क्रतुगतं नयेत् ॥ इति 
30 
PASPAS'AHNIKA 
If ślōkas also stand as authority, this ślōka which means- when jars of red liquor drunk cannot lead to Heaven, how can a drop of the same drink in sacrifices do it?-also may serve as authority. 
प्रमत्तगीत एष तत्रभवत: This is the expression of the rever- ed when he is not in right mood. 
यस्तु अप्रमत्तगीतस्तत् प्रमाणम् [ यस्तु प्रयुङ्क्ते ]. That which is said when he is in right mood is an authority. 
The sentence क्व पुनरिदं पठितम् ? means के एप यत्र पुनरिदं Tag? The slokas named bhrāja are ascribed to Katyayana. Kaiyaţa says that, though this verse in question (E) is one among bhrāja ślōkas, it is still taken to be authority since it agrees in meaning with the Vedic text':: सम्याज्ञातः सुष्ठु प्रयुक्तः स्वर्गे लोके कामधुग्भवति.' 
He again says that gufa is taken to be the predicate of अवारयोगवित् and not वाग्योगवित् on the authority of the maxim प्रकरणात् सामर्थ्यं बलीयः (Capacity to qualify is stronger than proximity); here the word ur means only fafa (proxi- mity) (i.e.) the word gera is capable of being taken only with अवारयोगवित् though the word वाग्योगवित् is near it. 
From this it is evident that one gets all happiness only when he is capable of using the right word in the right place. This suggests that only such persons will be chosen to officiate as priests. This can be done only with the know- ledge of grammar. Hence grammar helps Brāhmaṇas to get fees in the sacrifices and success elsewhere. 
अविद्वांसः-

Those illiterate persons who do not know that pluti (the use of three matras) must be made use of while blessing a man who prostrates, must be prostrated in the same way as women after one returns to his place after some time and be told by him that he is such by name. Grammar is to be studied lest we should be treated like women in abhivadana. 
From this we learn that knowledge of grammar is need- ed to keep up one's dignity as a learned Brahmana. 
विभक्ति कुर्वन्ति- 
याज्ञिकाः पठन्ति “ प्रयाजाः सविभक्तिकाः कार्याः " इति । 
न चान्तरेण व्याकरणं प्रयाजाः सविभक्तिकाः शक्याः कर्तुम् । [विभक्तिं कुर्वन्ति ] 
Chapters dealing with sacrifices read that the prayāja man- tras should be recited with the proper cases. But for the knowledge of grammar, it is not possible to do. 
Prayajas are the subsidiary hōmas in the Darsapurṇa- masa sacrifice. It is a duty enjoined by the Vedas to be performed by a house-holder in the same way as sthalipaka enjoined by the Smṛtis to be performed by the same person. Even though the mantras for prayāja hōmas are completely read, yet he is allowed to perform an iști if the yajamāna is attacked of stomach-ache after adhana or meets with a great disaster within a year, where the deity to be invoked is Agni. Hence while performing it, he is to change the mantras in such a way as to suit it. 
This is the same as the mentioned before. Hence it is clear that the second set of prayojanas mentioned is quotation from previous author or authors.

He who is capable of pronouncing the mantras correctly with respect to words, accent and letters is fit to become a sacrificer or to officiate as priest in sacrifices. Grammar is to be studied so that we may be qualified to become priests or to perform sacrifices. 
The word आर्त्विजीनः means a sacrificer if it is split as ऋत्विजमर्हति on the strength of the sutra यशत्विग्भ्यां घखत्री (P.). It means a priest if it is split as ऋत्विक्कर्म अर्हति on the strength of the Vārttika यज्ञत्विग्भ्यां तत्कर्माहतीत्युपसङ्ख्यानम्. 
This is also more or less the same as mentioned in यस्तु प्रयुङ्क्ते कुशलो विशेषे etc.

The Vrsabha which has four horns, three feet, two heads and seven hands and which is bound in three places cries 
33 

[[5]]

that the Great God entered the mortals. The four horns-the four parts of speech-noun, verb, upasarga (preposition) and nipata. Its three feet-the three tenses, past, future and present. Two heads-the two kinds of sabda, nitya (eter- nal) and karya (non-eternal). Its seven hands-the seven cases. It is bound three-fold-It is bound at three places- chest, neck and head. The word vrsabha is derived from the root vrs (4). The word reffa means 'makes noise.' Whence is it? The root means to make noise. The Great God entered the mortals-the Great God is sabda; the word H: literally means mortals and hence men; He entered them, Grammar is to be studied so that we may become one with the Great God. 
महो देवः here refers to शब्दब्रह्म. It has already been men- tioned that Indian Grammarians recognise four phases of speech-sound, of which is considered to be nitya and the other three पश्यन्ती, मध्यमा and वैखरी are kārya. The word 
arfa in the Bhāṣya text refers, in the opinion of Nagōji Bhatta, to the four phases of speech-sound, since, otherwise at the end dedaqar: cannot be appropriate. But from the following reading of Nirukta चत्वारि पदजातानि नामाख्याते चोपसर्गनिपाताश्च I think Mahābhāsyakāra also may have had the same reading. Though upasargas are only nipatas at a particular setting, yet they have been mentioned following the maxim called गोबलीवर्दन्याय. साम्यम् is interpreted by Nāgōji Bhatta to refer to on the strength of the Karika of Bhartṛhari, 
अपि प्रयोक्तुरात्मानं शब्दमन्तरवस्थितम् । प्राहुर्महान्तमृषभं येन सायुज्यमिप्यते ॥ 
The Rkaf...is the third Rk in the 58th Sukta of the fourth mandala in Rgvēda. Sāyaṇācārya, in his Bhāṣya, 
34 
PASPASĀHNIKA 
says that since the presiding deity of this Rk is one of five deities, this Rk is interpreted in five ways : Cf. 
सूक्तस्य अग्निसूर्यादिपञ्चदेवतात्मकत्वात् पञ्चधा अयं मन्त्रो व्याख्येयः । तथापि निरुक्ता क्तरीत्या यज्ञात्मकाग्नेः सूर्यस्य च प्रकाशकत्वेन तत्परतया व्याख्यायते 
... 
The same Rk is commented upon in Yaska's Nirukta XIII, 1-7. The expression चत्वारि, Mahābhāsyakāra says, is taken by others to refer to the following Rk. This clearly shows that this set of prayojanas was in vogue long before the time of Mahābhāṣyakāra. 
अपर आह- 
चत्वारि वाक्परिमिता पदानि तानि विदुर्ब्राह्मणा ये मनीषिणः । 
गुहा त्रीणि निहिता नेङ्गयन्ति तुरीयं वाचो मनुष्या वदन्ति ।

चत्वारि वाक्परिमिता पदानि चत्वारि पदजातानि, नामाख्यातोपसर्गनिपाताश्च । तानि विदुर्ब्राह्मणा ये मनीषिणः । मनस ईषिणो, मनीषिणः । गुहा त्रीणि निहिता नेङ्गयन्ति, गुहायां त्रीणि निहितानि नेङ्गयन्ति, न चेष्टन्ते, न निमिषन्तीत्यर्थः । तुरीयं वाचो मनुष्या वदन्ति । तुरीयं वा एतद्वाचो यन्मनुष्येषु वर्तते चतुर्थमित्यर्थः ॥ चत्वारि ॥ 
Others say :- 
There are four kinds of speech-sound, which are seen by those Brāhmaṇas who have controlled their mind. Three of them are not cognizable since they are inside the body. Men speak out only the fourth. 
The four kinds of speech-sound-the four kinds are noun, verb, upasarga and nipāta. They are seen by mani- sins-manisins are those who have controlled their mind. 

[[5]]

Three do not exhibit themselves being kept in guha-three are kept in guha-the meaning of a is, they do not operate (i.e.) exhibit. Men speak out the fourth-that which is among men is the fourth phase of the speech-sound. 
The same Rk is commented upon in Yaska's Nirukta XIII. 1. 9., where rf rf is explained thus:- 
चत्वारि पदानि ओंकारो महाव्याहृतयश्चेत्यार्थ, नामाख्याते च उपसर्गनिपाताश्च इति वैयाकरणाः, मन्त्रः कल्पो ब्राह्मणं चतुर्थो व्यावहारिकीति याज्ञिकाः, ऋचो यजूंषि सामानि चतुर्थो व्यावहारिकीति नैरुक्ताः । etc. 
It means this:- 
The four padas are, in the opinion of seers, praṇava and three vyahṛtis; they are, in the opinion of grammarians, noun, verb, upasarga and nipata; etc.; according to sacri- ficers they are mantra, kalpa, brahmana and the fourth that is in vogue; they according to Nairuktas, are Rk, yajus, Saman and those that are in vogue. It appears as the 45th Rk in 164th Sukta of the first Mandala in Rgveda. Sāyaṇa in his commentary mentions in addition to what has been mentioned in Nirukta, 
अपरे मान्त्रिकाः प्रकारान्तरेण प्रतिपादयन्ति परा पश्यन्ती मध्यमा वैखरीति चत्वारि । 
Other māntrikas think that the four are (परा, पश्यन्ती, मध्यमा and वैखरी). Nagoji Bhatta explains पदजातानि thus :-परापश्यन्ती- मध्यमावैखर्यः नामादीनि च। He seems to have added परापश्यन्ती- 
: since it is said that three of them are not cogniza- ble and since it was recognised by grammarians that, of the four phases of speech-sound, परा, पश्यन्ती and मध्यमा are not cognizable to those other than Yögins.

One, though he sees vale (speech), does not see her; one, though he hears her, does not hear her. Thus the first half of the stanza speaks of one who is not learned in grammar.

In order that vak may open herself to us, grammar is to be studied. 
The word a means though' and the word : means ‘one.' 'The expression पश्यन्नपि न पश्यति वाचम् means though he sees, he does not see speech.' The word a qualifies पश्यन् and not त्वः. The expression अपि खल्वेकः शृण्वन्नपि न शृणोत्ये- नाम् means though one hears, he does not hear her. The word तन्वम् is the earlier form of तनुम् (which means body). The word विसत्रे means 'discloses. The expression जायेव पत्ये उशती सुवासाः means it is like the wife who, being in clean dress and eager to meet her husband, opens herself. The word may here be taken to mean both mind and body. (The body and mind of vak is evidently her mean- ing). It is clear that the latter half of the stanza speaks of the learned grammarian. 

[[7]]

The word in two places and in the latter half suggest that one in, say, hundred takes to study grammar, one in, say, thousand studies to understand it, and one in, say, ten thousand or so is able to completely master it. 
The word सुवासाः suggests, as is stated in Yāska's Nirukta, that she is in her rtukala. Ṛtukala is the period of sixteen days beginning with the commencement of her monthly period and it, excluding the first three or four days, is considered to be the period of conception. It deserves to be noted that the injunction ऋतौ उपेयात् (one should meet his wife in Rtukala) found in Dharmasutras is taken to be a niyama-vidhi for those who have not given birth to a son; (i.e.) if they do not meet their wives in that period, they will meet with demerit. 
This R: “उत त्वः... सुवासाः " is found in the Rgveda as the fourth Rk in the 71st sukta of the 10th Mandala. In com- menting upon it Sayaṇācārya explains the following words. thus :- 
पश्यन्नपि - मनसा पर्यालोचयन्नपि 
न ददर्श दर्शनफलाभावान्न पश्यति 
उशती - सम्भोगं कामयमाना 
The same Rk is commented upon in Nirukta (I. 6. 3) thus :- 
अप्येकः पश्यन्न पश्यति वाचम् । अपि च शृण्वन्न शृणोत्येनाम् इत्यविद्वांस- माहार्थम् — अप्येकस्मै तन्वं विसत्र इति स्मात्मानं विवृणुते ज्ञानं प्रकाशनमर्थस्याहानया वाचोपमोत्तमया वाचा जायेव पत्ये, कामयमाना ऋतुकालेषु सुवासाः

Where learned men sift correct words from incorrect ones through knowledge as people the flour of barley meal through sieve, there they, being friends of words or having unblemished knowledge throughout are able to see the true meaning; for the propitious Goddess Laksmi resides in their speech. 
The word सक्तुः is derived from the root सच् and hence literally means that which can be cleaned only with diffi- culty. Or it is derived from the root, has by metathesis, assumed this form and means that which is spread.' The word faas means 'sieve' and it is so since it is wide or per- forated. The word fr: means learned men.' The word मनसा means 'through knowledge. The expression वाचमकत means ‘made words' (i.e.) sifted correct words from incorrect ones. In the expression अन्वा सखायः सख्यानि जानते the word सन्तः is understood after सखायः अत्र is lengthened to अत्रा for the sake of metre. Where ? (i.e.) to which place does the word a refer? That which is difficult of access and which can be achieved only through speech. Who are they ? (i.e.) to whom does the word : refer? Grammarians. Why is 
सखायः

it so? For the propitious Goddess Laksmi resides in their speech. The word Lakṣmi is derived from the root laks which means to shine and hence she becomes the lord. 
This Rk is found in the Rgvéda as the second Rk of 71st sukta of the 10th Mandala and it is commented upon in Yaska's Nirukta (IV. 2. 1 & 2). The expression सखायः सख्यानि a is interpreted in different ways. Sāyaṇācārya gives two interpretations:-(1) They possessing the knowledge of the sustra are able to understand the contents of the sastra correctly. (2) They being friends, get the fruits to be obtain- ed by the knowledge of speech. 
सखायः समानख्यानाः शास्त्रादिविषयज्ञानाः, ते सख्यानि तेषु भवानि ज्ञानानि जानते जानन्ति, यद्वा सखायः वाचा बद्धसख्याः सख्यानि जानन्ति वाक्ययुक्तानभ्युद- यान् लभन्ते ॥ 
(Sáyana) 
Durgācārya, the commentator on Nirukta interprets it thus: they having the same knowledge as others are able to gauge the merits of their partners. Cf. 
समानख्यानानामेव समानेषु शास्त्रेषु कृतश्रमाणां संख्यानि - विज्ञानानि ... 
इतरेतरस्य यो विज्ञानप्रकर्षः तं जानते ॥ 
2 
... 
Nāgoji Bhatta, on the other hand, interprets it thus :- They knowing that everything is Brahman become one with Brah- man. Cf. 
सखायः समानख्यातयः समानज्ञानाः तच्छब्दे ब्रह्मैकत्वज्ञानवन्तस्तेनैव दृष्टान्तेन सर्वपदार्थेषु ब्रह्मनिरूपिताभेदज्ञानवन्तः सख्यानि सायुज्यानि जानते प्राप्नुवन्तीत्यथः ॥ 
Nägōji Bhaṭṭa is of opinion that the rks 
चत्वारि शृङ्गा.... चत्वारि वाक्परिमिता पदानि उत त्वः and सक्तुमिव 
show that the study of grammar enables one to attain mōksa.

Scriptures dealing with sacrifices read thus:-If a house- holder performing agnihotra mispronounces a word, he will have to perform an expiatory ceremony (işti) called saras- vati isti. In order that we may not be put to the necessity of performing expiatory ceremonies, grammar is to be studied.

Scriptures dealing with sacrifices read thus:- 
On the day following the tenth from the birth of a son, a name should be given to him. The name should have for its initial a voiced letter, should have the semi-vowels in the middle, should not have a vrddhi letter as the first of its vowels, should have been current within three generations and should not be one very popular among his enemies' families. Only such a name enables him to have long life, success in life etc. It should contain two or four letters, should be made of a stem and a primary suffix and not a secondary suffix. Without the knowledge of grammar one does not know whether a suffix is primary or secondary. A

study of Dharmasutras enables one to understand that the expression द्वयक्षरं चतुरक्षरं वा is उपलक्षण and should be taken to mean even number of letters. 
It should be noted here that the names of men should contain even number of letters and those of women should contain odd number of letters. Since Mahābhāṣyakāra repeats the opinion of Dharmasutrakāras that a word should not have its first vowel a vrddhi letter, is it possible to assume that the names like रामः, नारायणः were not given to men in his time or before him?

Oh Varuna! you are a true God since the seven oceans (of cases) spirt out of your palate like fire through the holes from within a perforated iron image. 
सुदेवो असि means सत्यदेवोऽसि । Your seven oceans are the seven cases. The word means palate. The word काकुः means tongue. Since the tongue acts upon the palate, 
↑ सत्यदेवः स्याम् is another reading. Considering म्लेच्छा मा भूम, दुष्टान् शब्दान् मा प्रयुक्ष्महि... सत्यदेवा: स्याम is the better reading.

it is called काकुदम्. Just as fire from within & perforated well-made iron image spirts out, so also the seven case- oceans spirt out of your palate. Hence you are satyadeva. Grammar is to be studied so that we may become satya- devas. 
This Rk is the 12th Rk of the 58th sukta of the eighth Mandala in Rgvēda. Sāyaṇācārya in his commentary takes the word fera: to mean rivers. The same Rk is commented upon in Nirukta V. 4-9. 
किं पुनरिदं व्याकरणमेवाविजिगांसमानेभ्यः प्रयोजनमन्वाख्यायते, न पुनरन्य- दपि किंचित् ? ओम् इत्युक्त्वा वृत्तान्तशः शमित्येवमादीन् शब्दान् पठन्ति ॥ 
Why is the enumeration of benefits accruing from the study of Vyakarana alone made and not from that of any other (like the study of the Vedas etc.) ? They say 'ōm' and begin to repeat chapter by chapter the Vedic words com- mencing from शम्. 
पुरा कल्प एतदासीत्— संस्कारोत्तरकालं ब्राह्मणा व्याकरणं स्माधीयते । तेभ्यस्त- तत्स्थानकरणनादानुप्रदानज्ञेभ्यो वैदिकाः शब्दा उपदिश्यन्ते । तदद्यत्वे न तथा । वेदमधीत्य त्वरिता वक्तारो भवन्ति वेदान्नो वैदिकाः शब्दाः सिद्धाः, लोकाच्च लौकिकाः, अनर्थकं व्याकरणमिति । तेभ्य एवं विप्रतिपन्नबुद्धिभ्योऽध्येतृभ्यः सुहृद् भूत्वा आचार्य इदं शास्त्रमन्वाचष्टे इमानि प्रयोजनान्यध्येयं व्याकरणमिति ॥ 
Annambhatta in his uddyotona says that the correct reading is वृत्तान्तम् and it governs पठन्ति so that it means thoroughly (i.e.) in such a way that they can be pronounced without another's help. Cf. 
वृत्तान्तमिति क्रियाविशेषणम्, स्वाधीनोच्चारणक्षमं यथा भवति तथा पठन्तीत्यर्थः । एतेन 'वृत्तान्तं शमित्येवमादीन् इति भाव्यपाठः प्रामाणिकः, 'वृत्तान्तश: इति शसन्तपाठः प्रामादिक इति ज्ञेयम्. 
Bharthari in his Pradipika seems to have preferred वृत्तान्ततः to वृत्तान्तश: Cf. तत्राद्यादित्वात्तसिः अन्येषां वृत्तान्तशः इति पाठ: and takes that वृत्तान्त 
means प्रपाठक. 
†The word : is omitted in some editions.

This was in the old Kalpa that the Brahmaņas studied grammar after their upanayana. The Vedas were then taught to them who had a knowledge of the place of produc- tion and the effort, internal and external, of sounds. But now it is not so. After studying the Vedas, they hasten to become teachers thinking that, since they know Vedic words from the study of the Vedas and the laukika words from their contact with the world, the study of grammar is unnecessary. The Acārya (Mahābhāsyakāra) out of affec- tion towards such scholars with wrong notions, narrates this portion containing the benefits accruing from the study and hence the need of the study of Grammar. 
उक्तः शब्दः । स्वरूपमप्युक्तम् । प्रयोजनान्यप्युक्तानि ॥ 
(The classification of) word has been said; its definition has been given and the benefits have been narrated. 
शब्दानुशासनमिदानीं कर्तव्यम् । तत्कथं कर्तव्यम्, किं शब्दोपदेशः कर्तव्यः, आहोस्वित् अपशब्दोपदेशः, आहोस्वित् उभयोपदेशः इति ! 
S'abdanusāsana is now to be expounded. How should it be done? Is a list of correct words to be given, or a list of incorrect words; or both ? 
अन्यतरोपदेशेन कृतं स्यात् । तद्यथा भक्ष्यनियमेन अभक्ष्यप्रतिषेधो गम्यते— पञ्च पञ्चनखा भक्ष्याः *" इत्युक्ते गम्यत एतद् अतोऽन्ये अभक्ष्या इति । अभक्ष्य- प्रतिषेधेन वा भक्ष्यनियमः ; तद्यथा अभक्ष्यो ग्राम्यकुक्कुटः, अभक्ष्यो ग्राम्यसूकरः इत्युक्ते गम्यत एतद् 'आरण्यो भक्ष्यः' इति । एवमिहापि — यदि तावच्छब्दोपदेशः 
cf. भक्ष्याः श्वाविद्गोधाशशशल्यककच्छपखड्गा: खड्गवजी: पञ्चनखाः (Bodh. Dharma. 1-5. 131). and (Mahabharata, s'anti. 141, 70).

It is done by either method. From the injunction restricting the eatables, the non-eatables are inferred-when the injunction "Eat five five-clawed animals" is pronounced, it is inferred that all but those five animals are non-eatable. Similarly from the injunction restraining the non-eatables, the eatables are inferred. When the injunction 'Do not eat the domestic cock and the domestic pig' is pronounc- ed, it is inferred that the wild cock and boar may be eaten. Similar is the case here also; if the list of correct words like it: is given, it is inferred that ref etc., are incorrect and if, on the other hand, the list of incorrect words like reft etc., is given, it may be inferred that : etc., are correct words. 
NOTE 1. पञ्च पञ्चनखा भक्ष्याः - Is this अपूर्वविधिः, नियमविधिः or after arfafa: ? Since there is always a craving for every one to eat anything and hence even without this injunction one may eat the flesh of the five five-clawed animals, it is not अपूर्वविधिः like व्रीहीन् प्रोक्षति. 
Cf. Kaiyaṭa's statement at farfar, ardenera. 
It may be taken as परिसङ्ख्याविधिः like इमामगृभ्णन् रशनामृतस्य इत्यश्वाभिधानीमादत्ते, since by this injunction one is prevented from tasting the flesh of animals other than these five. Still Mahabhaṣyakāra takes it to be a fafafa: since it also wards off one from doing what is not mentioned there. 
Cf. Nagōjibhatta's statement 
पाक्षिकाप्राप्तिकाप्राप्तांशपरिपूरणफलो नियमः । अन्यनिवृत्तिफला च परिसङ्ख्येति चेन्न। नियमेऽप्यप्राप्तांशपरिपूरणरूपफलबोधनद्वारा अर्थादन्यनिवृत्तेः सत्त्वेन अभेदमाश्रित्योक्तेः॥ 
NOTE 2. From Nagōjibhaṭṭa's statement 

[[5]]

ये तु पञ्चपदस्य तदतिरिक्ते लक्षणा, भक्ष्यपदस्य च अभक्ष्ये सा 
it is clear that some scholars took to mean 'other than five' and भक्ष्याः to mean अभक्ष्याः; Nagojibhatta refutes them. Among many reasons cited in support of his view, the most important is the statement of Mahābhāṣyakāra himself 
भक्ष्यनियमेन अभक्ष्यप्रतिषेधो गम्यते 
किं पुनरत्र ज्यायः ? लघुत्वात् शब्दोपदेशः लघीयान् शब्दोपदेशः गरीयान् अपशब्दोपदेशः ; एकैकस्य शब्दस्य बहवोऽपभ्रंशाः, तद्यथा गौरित्यस्य शब्दस्य गावी गोणी गोता गोपोतलिका इत्येवमादयोऽपभ्रंशाः । इष्टान्वाख्यानं खल्वपि भवति । 
Which is better? The enumeration of the correct words (is better) since it is easier - The enumeration of correct words is easier and that of incorrect words is longer; for every correct word, there are many corrupt forms. For instance the corruptions of the word गौः are गावी, गोणी, गोता, गोपोतलिका etc. We also have (another advantage of) the direct enumeration of the words that we require. 
NOTE 3. The second reason given above suggests that the list of corrupt forms cannot enable us to understand the correct form of a word. 
अथैतस्मिन् शब्दोपदेशे सति किं शब्दानां प्रतिपत्तौ प्रतिपदपाठः कर्तव्यः, गौः, अश्वः, पुरुषः, हस्ती, शकुनिः, मृगः, ब्राह्मणः इत्येवमादयः शब्दाः पठितव्याः नेत्याह, अनभ्युपाय एष शब्दानां प्रतिपत्तौ प्रतिपदपाठः । एवं हि श्रूयते —— बृहस्पति- रिन्द्राय दिव्यं वर्षसहस्रं प्रतिपदोक्तानां शब्दानां शब्दपारायणं प्रोवाच नान्तं जगाम ' । बृहस्पतिश्च प्रवक्ता, इन्द्रश्च अध्येता, दिव्यं वर्षसहस्रम् अध्ययनकाल: न चान्तं जगाम । किं पुनरद्यत्वे यः सर्वथा चिरं जीवति स वर्षशतं जीवति ; चतुर्भिश्च प्रकौरर्विद्या उप-

When it has thus been decided that the list of correct words is to be given, there arises the question whether an inventory of all available correct words should be taken. Are we to enumerate words like गौः, अश्वः पुरुषः, हस्ती, शकुनिः, 
:: etc.? 'No' says he, for such a list is not an easy means to learn correct words.' Thus runs a story in scriptures-Bṛhaspati (the preceptor of the gods) taught Indra the work called S'abdaparayana containing all avail- able correct words for thousand divine years, but could not exhaust it; Bṛhaspati is the teacher, Indra is the student, the period of instruction is thousand divine years and still it was not possible to come to an end. When such is the case, how is it possible now? He who, after all, lives longest, lives hundred summers; Vidya is used in four ways in a man's life-time; it is learnt at the feet of the guru, it is revised, it is taught to a student and it is made use of in practical life (as in sacrifices etc.). If one attempts to learn at the feet of a guru the list of all correct words, his whole life-time will be used only in learning. Hence pratipada- patha is not an easy means to get at the knowledge of correct words. 
कथं तर्हि इमे शब्दाः प्रतिपत्तव्याः ? किञ्चित् सामान्यविशेषवलक्षणं प्रवर्त्यम्, येन अल्पेन यत्नेन महतो महतः शब्दौघान् प्रतिपद्येरन् ॥ 
How then are the correct words to be learnt? Some work formulating general and special rules should be written 
*The word is not found in some editions.

so that people can with a little effort learn the vast ocean of words. 
किं पुनस्तत् ? उत्सर्गापवादौ— कश्चिदुत्सर्गः कर्तव्यः कश्चिदपवादः । कथं- जातीयकः पुनरुत्सर्गः कर्तव्यः कथंजातीयकोऽपवादः ? सामान्येनोत्सर्गः कर्तव्यः, तद्यथा 'कर्मण्यण् ' ; तस्य विशेषेणापवादः, तद्यथा 'आतोऽनुपसर्गे कः ' ॥ 
What is it? General rules and exceptions: some gene- ral rule is to be formulated and some exception. How is the general rule to be framed and how the exception? General rule which is to apply to things in general, like is to be read and so are exceptions to apply to some special things among them like आतोऽनुपसर्गे कः 
NOTE. The sutra means that, if in a compound the verb is preceded by the object which qualifies it, the suffix अण् follows the verb; आतोऽनुपसर्गे कः means that, if the verb mentioned above ends in a and is not preceded by a preposition, it takes the suffix क. 
VI 
Having thus decided that Grammar formulating general rules and exceptions is necessary to enable one to under- stand correct words, Mahabhāṣyakāra discusses briefly whether the meaning of words is जाति (genus) or व्यक्ति (species) and whether the words are nitya or kārya. 
किं पुनराकृतिः पदार्थः, आहोस्वित् द्रव्यम् उभयमित्याह । कथं ज्ञायते ? उभयथा ह्याचार्येण सूत्राणि पठितानि । आकृति पदार्थ मत्वा 'जात्याख्यायामेकस्मिन् बहुवचनमन्यतरस्याम्' इत्युच्यते । द्रव्यं पदार्थं मत्वा 'सरूपाणामेकशेष एकविभक्तौ ' इत्येकशेष आरभ्यते ॥ 
Does a word connote genus or species? Both ' says he. How is it? For, sutras conceding both the views are written 
48 
PASPAS AHNIKA 
by the Acarya (Panini). The sutra arenenfen is read on the idea that the connotation of the word is genus and the sutra ... is read on the idea that it is individuality. 
NOTE. It is worth noting that genus cannot exist without vyakti and the latter cannot without the former. Still there are two classes of schools, one holding that word connotes only genus and vyakti comes along with it, and the other holding that word connotes only vyakti since the for- mer cannot exist away from the latter. But the Acarya Panini clearly shows in his work that he holds both the views, one in one context and the other in another. 
किं पुनर्नित्यः शब्दः, आहोस्वित्कार्यः : सङ्ग्रह एतत्याधान्येन परीक्षितम्- नित्यो वा स्यात् कार्यों वेति । तत्रोक्ता दोषाः, प्रयोजनान्यप्युक्तानि । तत्र त्वेष निर्णयः 
यद्येव नित्यः अथापि कार्यः, उभयथापि लक्षणं प्रवर्त्यम् इति ॥ 
Is sabda nitya or karya? This was examined in detail in the work Sangraha whether sabda is eternal or non- eternal. Merits and demerits on both sides were mentioned. This is the conclusion arrived at there, that, irrespective of sabda being nitya or karya, grammar is to be written. 
NOTE. Sangraha is a work written by Vyadi in 100,000 verses. It is unfortunate that the work is almost lost. Mahābhāṣyakara has already suggested that, if sabda refers to sphota, it is nitya and that, if it refers to dhvani-the sound that is produced by the vocal organs-it is kārya.

VII 
Having now decided that a should be written, Mahābhāṣyakāra may have dealt with the topic-the mean- ing of cum. Without doing it, he deals with the purpose served by . The reason for doing so is that he wants to observe in the discussion of topics, the order followed by the Varttikakara, since his Bhasya is an elaborate com- mentary on not only Panini's sutras but also on Katya- yana's varttikas. 
कथं पुनरिदं भगवतः पाणिनेराचार्यस्य लक्षणं प्रवृत्तम् " 
How has the Acarya Panini proceeded in his work? 
This serves as an introduction to the first varttika which runs as follows:- 
सिद्धे शब्दार्थसम्बन्धे लोकतोऽर्थप्रयुक्ते शब्दप्रयोगे शास्त्रेण धर्मनियमः, यथा लौकिकवैदिकेषु ॥ 
When word, its meaning and their relation (or word and the relation with its meaning) are learnt to be nitya from the world and word is used only in such meanings as are cur- rent there, the sastra enjoins (the use of correct words) for the sake of dharma as in the case of incidents, laukika and vaidika. 
Prabhat Chandra Chakravarti translates this in the Indian His- torical Quarterly Vol. I, 1925 thus:-Why, again, the grammatical treatise of the venerable Panini has been made? (If words are held to be eternal, what is the use of grammar?) Since the previous sentence is, the legitimate question that follows is, what doc- trine Panini holds in his work. This is clear from Käiyata's statement किमाचार्य एवं स्वष्टा शब्दार्थसम्बन्धानाम् अथ स्मर्ता इति प्रश्नः 
50 
PASPASAHNIKA 
Here Mahabhaṣyakara deals in detail with the mean- ings of (1) सिद्धे, (2) अर्थः and (3) धर्मः and elucidates the expressions लोकतः and लौकिकवैदिकेषु and takes लोकतः twice, once along with शब्दार्थसम्बन्धे and once with अर्थप्रयुक्ते. 
सिद्ध शब्दार्थसम्बन्धे- 
सिद्धे शब्देऽर्थे सम्बन्धे चेति 
Here Mahabhaṣyakara suggests that the vigraha of 
शब्दार्थसम्बन्धे is शब्दच अर्थश्च सम्बन्धश्च एतेषां समाहारः, शब्दार्थसम्बन्धम्, तस्मिन् । 
अथ सिद्धशब्दस्य कः पदार्थः नित्यपर्यायवाची सिद्धशब्दः । कथं ज्ञायते ? यत्कूटस्थेषु अविचालिषु भावेषु वर्तते; तद्यथा, सिद्धा द्यौः सिद्धा पृथिवी, सिद्धमाकाशम् इति । 
Now what is the meaning of the word fer? It is the syno- nym of the word nitya. How is it so? Since it is used along with objects which do not move and which do not change. Ex. सिद्धा द्यौः (the Heaven is nitya), सिद्धा पृथिवी (the earth is nitya) and सिद्धमाकाशम् (the sky is nitya). 
NOTE. The expressions fear at: etc., are not based up- on the conception that द्यौः पृथिवी etc., are eternal, but upon the conception that they are relatively permanent.* 
Mahābhāṣyakāra then quotes instances where the word सिद्ध means अनित्य. 
ननु च भोः कार्येष्वपि वर्तते तद्यथा — सिद्ध ओदनः, सिद्धः सूपः, सिद्धा यवागूः इति । यावता कार्येष्वपि वर्तते, तत्र कुत एतन्नित्यपर्यायवाचिनो ग्रहणम्, न पुनः 
* Cf. Nagojibhatta's statement 
भाष्ये द्यावापृथिव्याद्यपि व्यावहारिकनित्यत्वाभिप्रायेण दृष्टान्तितम्, आकाशस्यापि व्यावहारिक- नित्यत्वमेवाचार्याभिमतम् ॥

कार्ये यः सिद्धशब्द इति ॥ सङ्ग्रहे तावत् कार्य प्रतिद्वन्द्विभावान्मन्यामहे नित्यपर्याय- वाचिनो ग्रहणमिति इहापि तदेव || 
F 
Oh Sir, the word fer is used also in connection with transi- ent objects; Ex. सिद्ध ओदनः (Food is ready); सिद्धः सूपः (Dhal is ready): fear : (the yavāgū preparation is ready). Since the word is used in connection with transient objects also, how can it be said that it means nitya and not karya? Since the word is used in the Sangraha as antonym to karya, we infer that it means nitya there; so also here. 
Since the word is used in Sangraha as an antonym to karya, it is but right that it means nitya there. Since there is no criterion here to decide its meaning one way or the other, Mahābhāṣyakara suggests another way to come to the same conclusion. 
अथवा सन्त्येकपदान्यपि अवधारणानि । तद्यथा अव्मक्षो वायुभक्ष इति, अप एव भक्षयति, वायुमेव भक्षयति इति गम्यते; एवमिहापि सिद्ध एव न साध्य इति ॥ 
Or even single words have the restrictive sense. Ex. rer: and ar. They respectively mean, 'one who feeds himself only on water' and one who feeds himself only on air.' Similarly the word fe here means only fee and not sadhya. 
The defect that underlies this explanation is this. The words: and age are compound words, while the word fra is a single word. In splitting the compound the word which denotes restriction may be brought in. Such is not the case with single words. Hence Mahābhāṣyakāra tries to explain it thus. 
अथवा पूर्वपदलोपोऽत्र द्रष्टव्यः - अत्यन्तसिद्धः सिद्ध इति तद्यथा देवदत्तो दत्तः, सत्यभामा भामा इति ॥ 
52 
PASPASAHNIKA 
Or it may be considered that a word which preceded fe has been dropped, its original form being arrafe in the same way as दत्तः is the shortened form of देवदत्तः; and भामा of सत्य- 
भामा. 
The defect that underlies this explanation is this. In the case of the words दत्तः and भामा standing respectively for देवदत्तः and सत्यभामा, it should be noted that देवदत्तः and सत्यभामा are mentioned at the first instance and only later on for the sake of brevity : and war are used. The same is not the case here. Besides there is nothing to suggest that the word सिद्ध is used here to denote अत्यन्तसिद्ध. 
Hence Mahabhāṣyakāra suggests the final solution thus :- 
अथवा व्याख्यानतो विशेषप्रतिपत्तिः न हि सन्देहादलक्षणम् इति नित्यपर्याय- वाचिनो ग्रहणमिति व्याख्यास्यामः ॥ 
If so, we explain that the word fea means fa since a text cannot be thrown away on the ground that it is not clear. Its correct sense should be understood from the com- mentaries or the interpretation given by the commentators. 
किं पुनरनेन वर्थेन किं न महता कण्ठेन नित्यशब्द एवोपात्तः, यस्मि- न्नुपादीयमानेऽसन्देहः स्यात् ? 
Why should he give room for this kind of interpretation? Why should he not, with his open mouth, have given ex- pression to the word nitya, when there would be no ambigu- ity ?

For the sake of mangala (auspiciousness). The Acarya (Katyāyana), eager of reaping the fruit of mangala said fera for the sake of mangala at the commencement of his great work. The works which start with mangala shine well and enable the scholars to become heroic and long-lived and to have their objects fully accomplished. 
NOTE: It deserves notice that the appellationer is applied by Patañjali not only to Panini but also to Katya- 
yana. 
Then the author begins to show that even if the word nitya is used instead of siddha, it is not free from ambigu- ity— 
अयं खलु नित्यशब्दः नावश्यं कूटस्थेप्वविचालिषु भावेषु वर्तते । किं तर्हि ? आभीक्ष्ण्येऽपि वर्तते, तद्यथा नित्यप्रहसितो नित्यप्रजल्पित इति । यावता आमीक्ष्ण्येऽपि वर्तते तत्राप्यनेनैवार्थः स्यात्, ‘व्याख्यानतो विशेषप्रतिपत्तिः न हि सन्देहादलक्षणम् ' इति । पश्यति तु आचार्यो मङ्गलार्थश्चैव सिद्धशब्द आदितः प्रयुक्तो भविष्यति, शक्ष्यामि चैनं नित्य- पर्यायवाचिनं । वर्णयितुमिति । अतः सिद्धशब्द एवोपात्तो न नित्यशब्दः । 
Even this word nitya does not invariably connote eternity. What then? It is used to connote repetition also. Ex. नित्य- प्रहसितः (One who ever laughs) and नित्यप्रजल्पितः (one who ever prattles). Since it connotes repetition also, it should be

free from ambiguity only by the interpretation of the commentators. The Acarya thinks that the word siddha is used at the commencement for the sake of mangala and I am able to interpret that it means nitya. Hence is the use of the word siddha and not nitya. 
Having thus discussed the meaning of the word fea, the author begins to deal with the statement शब्दे अर्थ सम्बन्धे and discusses whether the word artha denotes genus or indi- vidaality. 
अथ कं पुनः पदार्थ मत्वा एष विग्रहः क्रियते ' सिद्धे शब्दे अर्थ सम्बन्धे च ' इति ? आकृतिमित्याह । कुत एतत् आक्रुतिर्हि नित्या द्रव्यमनित्यम् । 
With what meaning (genus or individuality) in mind is the compound split thus शब्दे अर्थ सम्बन्धे ? 'Akrti' (genus), says he. Why so? For ākrti is nityā and dravya is anitya. 
अथ द्रव्ये पदार्थों कथं विग्रहः कर्तव्यः सिद्धे शब्दे अर्थसम्बन्धे च इति । नित्यो हि अथवतामर्थैरभिसम्बन्धः || 
If dravya is padartha, how is the compound split? It is split thus शब्दे अर्थसम्बन्धे; for, the relation of the word to its meaning is nitya, (though the meaning in the form of dravya is anitya). 
The author then takes the word akṛti to connote shape and in that case begins to deal with the nature of the split- ting of the compound- 
अथवा द्रव्य एव पदार्थों एष विग्रहो न्याय्यः सिद्धे शब्दे अर्थे सम्बन्धे चेति ; द्रव्यं हि नित्यम्, आकृतिरनित्या । कथं ज्ञायते ? एवं हि दृश्यते लोके मृत् कयाचिदा- कृत्या युक्ता पिण्डो भवति, पिण्डाकृतिमुपमृद्य घटिकाः क्रियन्ते, घटिकाकृतिमुपमृद्य कुण्डिकाः क्रियन्ते; तथा सुवर्ण कयाचिदाकुत्या युक्तं पिण्डो भवति, पिण्डाकृतिमुपमृद्य रुचकाः

Or the compound is split thus even when the meaning of the word is dravya; for the dravya always remains the same, while the shape is changing. How is it? Thus it is seen in the world-Mud in one shape becomes a clod; it is broken and it is converted into small pots; that shape is destroyed and the same mud is made into jars. So also is gold. In one shape it is a ball; it is destroyed and the gold is converted into rings; they are destroyed and it is made into bracelets; that shape is destroyed and it is made into a kind of amulets; that being destroyed, it is made into ear-rings as bright as red-hot charcoal of ebony wood. The shape changes from one to another, but the material re- mains the same. Though the shape is destroyed, the material remains. 
आकृतावपि पदार्थ एष विग्रहो न्याय्यः सिद्धे शब्दे अर्थ सम्बन्धे चेति । ननु चोक्तम् 'आकृतिरनित्या' इति । नैतदस्ति । नित्या आकृतिः । कथम् ? न कचिदुपरतेति कृत्वा सर्वत्रोपरता भवति, द्रव्यान्तरस्था तु उपलभ्यते ।। 
Even accepting äkṛti to be padartha, it is but proper to split the compound thus शब्दे अर्थ सम्बन्धे. akrti is anitya? No, it is nitya. seen at one place, it does not fail found in other objects (of the same genus). 
Has it not been said that How? Though it is not to exist in all places; it is

Or this is not the definition of nitya:-that which is free from संसर्गानित्यता, परिणामानित्यता and प्रध्वंसानित्यता; but that from which its inherent property is never severed is nitya. What is tattva? It-ness is tattva. The tattva is never separated from ākrti. 
NOTE. संसर्गानित्यता is seen from the apparent red crystal in the proximity of red-flower. The relation of redness and crystal is anitya, since it disappears at the disappearance of the red flower. परिणामानित्यता is seen in the process of a fruit becoming a ripe fruit. The relation with its colour when it is not ripe disappears when it becomes ripe and hence the colour is anitya. प्रध्वंसानित्यता is complete destruction.

अथवा किं न एतेन इदं नित्यं इदम् अनित्यम् इति । यन्नित्यं तं पदार्थ मत्वैष विग्रहः क्रियते — सिद्धे शब्दे अर्थे सम्बन्धे चेति ॥ 
Or what is the use of this discussion that one is nitya and the other anitya? When we take the meaning to be nitya, we split the compound thus : शब्दे अर्थ सम्बन्धे. 
कथं पुनर्ज्ञायते सिद्धः शब्दोऽर्थः सम्बन्धश्चेति ? 'लोकतः । यल्लोके अर्थमर्थ- मुपादाय शब्दान्प्रयुञ्जते, नैषां निर्वृत्तौ यत्नं कुर्वन्ति । ये पुनः कार्या भावाः निर्वृत्तौ

How is it understood that sabda, artha and sambandha are nitya? From the world. For words are used to denote objects and no effort is made to Coin them. Effort is taken in creating such things as are karya. For instance he who has the use of a pot goes to the potter's house and says, 
• Make a pot; I have to use it. But no one similarly goes to the house of a grammarian and says, 'Coin words; I shall make use of them.' He thinks of the object and makes use of words denoting them. 
यदि तर्हि लोक एषु प्रमाणम्, किं शास्त्रेण क्रियते ! 'लोकतोऽर्थप्रयुक्ते शब्द- प्रयोगे शास्त्रेण धर्मनियमः ' । लोकतोऽर्थप्रयुक्ते शब्दप्रयोगे शास्त्रेण धर्मनियमः क्रियते । किमिदं धर्मनियम इति धर्माय नियमो धर्मनियमः, धर्मार्थो वा नियमः धमनियमः, धर्मप्रयोजनो वा नियमः धर्मनियमः

If then the world is the authority for the use of words, what purpose is served by the Vyakarana sastra? When words

PASPAS'AHNIKA 
are used in the sense in which each is current in the world, injunction to use the correct word is made by the sastra for the sake of dharma. Dharma-niyama, what does it mean? It means niyama for dharma, niyama for the sake of dharma and niyama having for its fruit dharma. 
NOTE. It deserves to be noted that Käiyata clearly says that the compound dharma-niyamaḥ should be split only as dharmasya niyamah. If so, Mahabhaṣyakara does not mention how the compound is split, but brings out the sense of the compound. All the three ways mentioned there -धर्माय नियमः, धर्मार्थो वा नियमः and धर्मप्रयोजनो वा नियमः may be taken to mean the same. The only difference is that the second is more explanatory than the first and the third is more explanatory than the second. What is, then, the meaning of dharma? It may be interpreted in three ways: 1. नित्यकर्म Cf. निष्कारणो धर्मः पडङ्गो वेदोऽध्येयः ज्ञेयश्च (M. B. I. 1, 1). 2. यज्ञकर्म Cf. याज्ञे कर्मणि स नियमः । (M. B. I, 1, 1). 3. अपूर्वम् Cf. ज्ञाने धर्म इति चेत्तथाधर्मः । ( M. B. I, 1, 1). 
Nagōjibhaṭṭa says (as the opinion of some) that in a fagm: धर्म has the first meaning, in धर्मार्थो वा नियमः it has the second meaning and in as a far: it has the third meaning. But it is better to take that it has all the three meanings in each. 
यथा लौकिकवैदिकेषु । प्रियतद्धिता दाक्षिणात्याः, यथा लोके वेदे चेति प्रयोक्तव्ये यथा लौकिकवैदिकेष्विति प्रयुञ्जते । अथवा युक्त एवात्र तद्धितार्थः, यथा लौकिकेषु वैदिकेषु च कृतान्तेषु । लोके तावत् अभक्ष्यो ग्राम्यकुक्कुट, अभक्ष्यो ग्राम्यसूकर

इत्युच्यते । भक्ष्यं च नाम क्षुलतिघातार्थमुपादीयते, शक्यं चानेन श्वमांसादिभिरपि क्षुत्प्रतिहन्तुम्, तत्र नियमः क्रियते इदं भक्ष्यम् इदम् अभक्ष्यम् इति । तथा खेदात् स्त्रीषु प्रवृत्तिर्भवति, समानश्च खेदविगमो गम्यायां च अगम्यायां च तत्र नियमः क्रियते इयं गम्या इयम् अगम्या इति ॥ 
As in laukika and vaidika incidentst. The Southerners are fond of using words with taddhita suffixes (without special significance). They, instead of using लोके and वेदे, use लौकिक- वैदिकेषु. Or it is but proper that the taddhita suffix has a meaning. The term fag may be taken to mean लौकिकेषु वैदिकेषु च कृतान्तेषु. There is with reference to the worldly incident, the saying that the domestic cock should not be eaten nor the domestic pig; food is taken to remove. hunger; it may be removed by any one even with dogs' meat; there is the restriction made that one is eatable and the other is non-eatable. Similarly man meets woman to satisfy his sexual passion; it may be had in meeting any woman deserving or non-deserving; there is the restriction made that one is meet-able and the other is non-meet-able. 
NOTE. The mention of the word for suggests that Katyayana was a Southerner, while both the Sutrakāra and the Bhasyakara were Northerners. Some think that there is a little sneer here. 
वेदे खल्वपि पयोव्रतो ब्राह्मणः, यवागूत्रतो राजन्यः, आमिक्षानतो वैश्यः इत्युच्यते ; व्रतं च नाम अभ्यवहारार्थमुपादीयते; शक्यं चानेन शालिमांसादीन्यपि ऋतयितुम् ; तत्र नियमः क्रियते । तथा बैल्वः खादिरो वा यूपः स्यात् इत्युच्यते ; 
f The expression लौकिकवैदिकेषु is taken to mean in the smrti and śruti texts by Kaiyața and others. But on viewing this with pit it is better to take it in the sense 'in the incidents of the world and Védic rituals.' In that case शास्त्रेण धर्मनियमः is understood after लौकिकवैदिकेषु.

यूपश्च नाम पश्चनुबन्धार्थमुपादीयते ; शक्यं चानेन यत्किंचिदेव काष्ठमुच्छ्रित्य अनुच्छ्रित्य वा पशुरनुबन्धुम् तत्र नियमः क्रियते । तथा अनौ कपालान् अधिश्रित्य अभिमन्त्र - यते - भृगूणामङ्गिरसां धर्मस्य तपसा तप्यध्वम् इति; अन्तरेणापि मन्त्रम् अग्निर्दहन- कर्मा कपालानि सन्तापयति तत्र च नियमः क्रियते — एवं क्रियमाणमभ्युदयकारि भवतीति ॥

So with reference to the Vedic rituals it is said that during austerities Brāhmaṇa, if hungry, may take milk, Kṣattriya Yavagu, and Vaisya curd of milk and whey; Vrata intends only food; Rice and meat may serve the same purpose; still restriction is made. So also it is said that the stake to which the sacrificial animal is tied should be of bilva tree or khadira tree; the stake is intended to tie the sacrificial animal; any piece of wood standing upright or otherwise may serve the purpose; there is the restriction made. Similarly kapala's-small pieces of mud-are put in fire and the mantra which means, Heat them with the intense heat of Bhrgus and Angiras' is pronounced; the small pieces will be heated whether the mantra is recited or not; there is the restriction made that, if it is done so, it begets merit. 
एवमिहापि समानायामर्थावगतौ शब्देन चापशब्देन च धर्मनियमः क्रियते- शब्देनैव अर्थोऽभिधेयो, नापशब्देन इति; एवं क्रियमाणमभ्युदयकारि भवतीति ॥ 
So here also though the meaning is understood both from the correct word and the corrupt one, still restriction is made that meaning is to be made out only from the correct word, since from it alone accrues merit. 
The meaning of the first varttika having been fully explained, there arises a doubt whether word that is not current in the world is correct or not, since it has been said there that it is used only in such meanings as are current in the world.

Even such words as are in your opinion obsolete are in use. Where? In Veda-viz. saptasye revati revad uşa, yadvo revati revatyam tam uşu, yan me narah śrutyam brahma cakra, yatra naścakra jarasam tanūnām. 
Next arises the doubt whether merit accrues from sabdajñāna or sabda-prayoga since it is said in the värttika lõkataḥ arthaprayukte sabda-prayögé, sastrēņa dharma- niyamah.' Kaiyața says that the following topic arises from the śruti. 
एकः शब्दः सम्यग् ज्ञातः शास्त्रान्वितः सुप्रयुक्तः स्वर्गे लोके कामधुग् भवति, where it is doubtful whether the importance is upon jñana or prayoga. 
किं पुनः शब्दस्य ज्ञाने धर्मः आहोस्वित् प्रयोगे ? 
Nagōjibhatta says that jñana may be considered important and prayoga accessory, as jñata is read first in the s'ruti or jñana may be considered accessory to prayoga, since all jñanas except atma-jñāna are needed only for application.

Does merit-accrue from the knowledge of correct words or from the use of correct words? 
कश्चात्र विशेषः ? 
What is the difference here? 
ज्ञाने धर्म इति चेत्तथा अधर्मः 
ज्ञाने धर्म इति चेतथाधर्मोऽपि प्राप्नोति । यो हि शब्दाञ्जानाति अपशब्दा- नप्यसौ जानाति । यथैव शब्दज्ञाने धर्मः एवमपशब्दज्ञानेऽप्यधर्मः ॥ 
If merit accrues from knowledge, so also will demerit. If it is considered that merit accrues from knowledge, demerit also will accrue; for he who knows correct words knows their corruptions also; as merit accrues from the knowledge of correct words, so also will demerit accrue from that of their corruptions. 
अथवा भूयानधर्मः प्राप्नोति । भूयांसो अपशब्दाः, अल्पीयांसः शब्दाः । एकैकस्य शब्दस्य बहवोऽपभ्रंशाः तद्यथा गौरित्यस्य गावी गोणी गोता गोपोतलिका इत्येव- मादयोऽपभ्रंशाः || 
Or greater demerit will accrue; for greater in number are the corruptions and smaller in number are correct words. For every correct word there are many corruptions. viz. गावी, गोणी, गोता, गोपोतलिका etc., are the corrupt forms of one single word : 
आचारे नियमः

If so, let the merit accrue from prayoga. 
प्रयोगे सर्वलोकस्य 
यदि प्रयोगे धर्मः सर्वो लोकोऽभ्युदयेन युज्येत 
If it is from prayoga, it will be of the whole world. If merit accrues from prayoga, the whole world will get merit. 
कश्चेदानीं भवतो मत्सरो यदि सर्वो लोकोऽभ्युदयेन युज्येत ? 
Why should you be envious if the whole world get merit? 
न खलु कश्चिन्मत्सरः । प्रयत्नानर्थक्यं तु भवति । फलवता च नाम प्रयत्नेन भवितव्यम् । न च प्रयत्नः फलाद्व्यतिरेच्यः ॥ 
There is no envy. The effort will be fruitless. It is indeed necessary that every effort should bear fruit. Effort should not be deprived of fruit. 
ननु च ये कृतप्रयत्नास्ते साधीयः शब्दान् प्रयोक्ष्यन्ते, त एव साधीयोऽभ्युदयेन योक्ष्यन्ते 
Oh! Only those who have worked in grammar make use of words very correctly and hence only they can very well meet with merit. 
व्यतिरेकोऽपि वै लक्ष्यते दृश्यन्ते हि कृतप्रयत्नाश्चाप्रवीणाः, अकृतप्रयत्नाश्च प्रवीणाः तत्र फलव्यतिरेकोऽपि स्यात्

Reverse also is seen; It is seen that those who have worked in grammar are not able to use correct words and those who have not worked at it are able to use correct words. Hence the fruit also will be reversed.

If so, there is no merit in the knowledge alone nor in the application alone. 
किं तर्हि ? Where then ? 
शास्त्रपूर्वके प्रयोगेऽभ्युदयस्तत्तुल्यं वेदशब्देन 
शास्त्रपूर्वकं यः शब्दान् प्रयुङ्क्ते सोऽभ्युदयेन युज्यते ; तत्तुल्यं वेदशब्देन । वेदशब्दा अप्येवमभिवदन्ति 'योऽग्निष्टोमेन यजते य उ चैनमेवं वेद' 'योऽग्नि नाचिकेतं चिनुते य उ चैनमेवं वेद ' ॥ 
Merit only from the prayoga after the study of grammar and it is similar to the sacrifices signified by the Vedic expressions. He who makes use of words after the study of grammar meets with merit. It is similar to those which are signified by Vedic expressions. They say thus:-He who performs Agniṣṭoma and knows how it should be done; he who performs Naciketacayana and knows how it should be done. 
अपर आह तत्तुल्यं वेदशब्देनेति — यथा वेदशब्दा नियमपूर्वमधीताः फलवन्तो भवन्त्येवं यः शास्त्रपूर्वकं शब्दान् प्रयुङ्क्ते सोऽभ्युदयेन युज्यत इति 
Another interprets the expression tat tulyam veda-sabdēna thus:-As the Vedic texts studied according to the enjoined rules are fruitful, so also he who makes use of words after studying grammar meets with merit. 
From the above it is clear that, according to the Värt- tikakāra, merit accrues only from prayoga preceded by

vyakaranadhyayana. 
Mahabhaṣyakāra seems to differ 
from him and hence opens the same topic again. 
अथवा पुनरस्तु ज्ञान एवं धर्म इति 
Or let the merit accrue only from knowledge. 
ननु चोक्तम् ज्ञाने धर्म इति चेत्तथाधर्म इति 
Was it not said that if dharma is from jñana, adharma will similarly accrue? 
नैष दोषः, शब्दप्रमाणका वयम् यच्छन्द आह तदस्माकं प्रमाणम् । शब्दश्य शब्दज्ञाने धर्ममाह, नापशब्दज्ञानेऽधर्मम् । यच्च पुनरशिष्टाप्रतिषिद्धं नैव तद् दोषाय भवति, नाभ्युदयाय । तद्यथा हिक्कितहसितकण्डूयितानि नैव दोषाय भवन्ति नाभ्युदयाय ॥ 
No, this harm will never be. We have sabda for our autho- rity; whatever sabda says is authority for us; sabda says that merit accrues from the knowledge of words and it does not say that demerit accrues from the knowledge of corrupt words. That which is neither enjoined nor forbidden produ- ces neither merit nor demerit viz, hiccough, laugh, and scratching produce neither demerit nor merit. 
6 
अथवा अभ्युपाय एवापशब्दज्ञानं शब्दज्ञाने । यो अपशब्दाञ्जानाति शब्दा- नप्यसौ जानाति । तदेवं ज्ञाने धर्म इति ब्रुवतोऽर्थादापन्नं भवति - ' अपशब्दज्ञानपूर्वके शब्दज्ञाने धर्मः' इति 
Or the knowledge of corrupt forms of words leads to that of correct ones; he who knows the corrupt forms knows the correct ones also. Hence the statement of him who says that knowledge gives merit leads of its own accord to the infer- ence that knowledge of correct words preceded by that of corrupt forms gives merit.

“अथवा, कूपखानकवदेतद्भविष्यति तद्यथा, कूपखानकः कूप खनन् यद्यपि मृदा पांसुभिधावकीर्णो भवति, सोऽप्सु संजातासु तत एव तं गुणमासादयति, येन च स दोषो निर्हण्यते, भूयसा चाभ्युदयेन योगो भवति । एवमिहापि यद्यप्यपशब्द- ज्ञानेऽधर्मस्तथापि यस्त्वसौ शब्दज्ञाने धर्मस्तेन च स दोषो निर्घानिष्यते, भूयसा चाभ्युद- येन योगो भविष्यति ॥ 
Or this may be like a well-sinker. A well-sinker, though he is stuck in the mud and is covered with dust in the process of sinking the well, gets himself rid of the mud and dust with the water as soon as he reaches it, and gets plenty of good from it. So also here even though demerit accrues from the knowledge of corrupt words, yet merit accrues from that of correct ones, which destroys the effect of the former and leads to much good. 
यदप्युच्यते आचारे नियमः इति याज्ञे कर्मणि स नियमोऽन्यत्रानियमः । एवं हि श्रूयते — यर्वाणस्तर्वाणो नाम ऋषयो बभूवुः प्रत्यक्षधर्माणः परापरज्ञाः विदितवेदितव्या अधिगतयाथातथ्याः ते तत्रभवन्तो यद्वानस्तद्वान इति प्रयोक्तव्ये यर्वाणस्तर्वाण इति प्रयुञ्जते, याज्ञे पुनः कर्मणि नापभाषन्ते । तैः पुनरसुरैर्याज्ञे कर्मण्यपभाषितम्, ततस्ते परा-

As regards the statement acare niyamah, it should be taken that the niyama holds only to sacrifice so that there may be aniyama elsewhere. For it is mentioned in the Vedas that the revered sages named Yarvana and Tarvana who could see everything with their mind's eye, who could distin- guish the infinite and finite, who had śravana, manana and nididhyasana of atman and who had become one with para- matman used the words yarvanah and tarvanah instead of yadvanal and tadvanah (in ordinary conversation) and pro-

nounced the correct words in sacrifices. Those asuras, on the other hand, pronounced corrupt words in sacrifices and hence met with disaster. 
Here it should be noted that the Värttikakára and the Mahābhāṣyakara differ in their views on this topic. The former decides that one gets merit only when he uses correct words (in sacrifices and elsewhere) knowing them as such through his study of grammar. Hence the mere study of grammar does not bear any fruit and only those who have studied grammar and make correct use of them can get dharma. But on the other hand Mahabhāṣyakāra decides that the study of grammar brings dharma (:) and only correct words should be used in sacrifices whether they have studied grammar or not (याज्ञे कर्मणि नियमः)

fan: is 
In the first värttika, the statement are found. There the word e denotes . This is evident from the following statements of Mahābhāsyakāra रक्षार्थ वेदा- नामध्येय व्याकरणम्, तस्मादध्येय व्याकरणम्, न चान्तरेण व्याकरणम्, किं पुनरिदं व्याकरणमेवाधिजिगांसमानेभ्यः, व्याकरणं स्माधीयते, अनर्थकं व्याकरणम् 
etc. 
Now begins the the discussion on the meaning of the word vyakarana. 
अथ व्याकरणमित्यस्य शब्दस्य कः पदार्थः 
Now what is the meaning of the word vyakarana? 
सूत्रम् Sutra. 
सूत्रे व्याकरणे षष्ठयर्थोऽनुपपन्नः 
सूत्रे व्याकरणे षष्ठ्यर्थो नोपपद्यते व्याकरणस्य सूत्रम् इति । किं तर्हि तदन्य- त्सूत्राद् व्याकरणम, यस्यादः सूत्रं स्यात् 
72 
PASPAS AHNIKA 
Vyakarana being sutra, unsuitability of the sixth case meaning. If Vyakarana means sutra, sixth case meaning in the expression " Vyakaranasya sutram" won't suit. Is it then that vyakarana is different from sutra, so that it may be said that this sutra is of that? 
शब्दाप्रतिपत्तिः 
शब्दानां चाप्रतिपत्तिः प्राप्नोति, व्याकरणात् शब्दान्प्रतिपद्यामहे इति । न हि सूत्रत एव शब्दान्प्रतिपद्यन्ते । 
Non-knowledge of sabdas. Knowledge of words cannot be had in the manner in which it is generally known that we get the knowledge of words from Vyakarana; for words are not understood only from sutras. 
faf Whence then? 
व्याख्यानतश्च From the commentary also. 
ननु च तदेव सूत्रं विगृहीतं व्याख्यानं भवति : 
Is it not that the same sutra split into words becomes com- mentary? 
न केवलानि चर्चापदानि व्याख्यानम् वृद्धिः आत् ऐच् इति 
The mere repetition of words composing a sutra like vrddhih, at, aic does not serve as commentary. 
f! What then? 
उदाहरणं प्रत्युदाहरणं वाक्याध्याहार इत्येतत्समुदितं व्याख्यानं भवति 
Example, counter - example, filling-up the ellipsis in the sentence-all these put together form the commentary. 
73

एवं तर्हि शब्दः 
If so, sabda is vyākarana. 
शब्दे ल्युडर्थः 
यदि शब्दो व्याकरणं ल्युडर्थो नोपपद्यते, व्याक्रियन्ते शब्दा अनेनेति व्याकरणम् । न हि शब्देन किंचिद् व्याक्रियते । 
Sabda being Vyakarana, the (unsuitability of the) meaning of the suffix ana. If sabda is taken to be vyakarana, the meaning of the suffix ana in the word vyakarana does not suit since it is derived as vyakriyante sabda anena; for nothing is analysed into prakrti and pratyaya on the authority of sabda. 
केन तर्हि ? If so, by what ? 
सूत्रेण । By sutra. 
भवे च तद्धितः 
भवे च तद्धितो नोपपद्यते, व्याकरणे भवो योगो वैयाकरण इति । न हि शब्दे भवो योगः 
The unsuitability of the secondary suffix in the sense of bhava. The secondary suffix which has the sense of existing in the word vaiyakarana, which means the sutra in vya- karana, does not suit; for sūtra does not exist in sabda.mer 
क तर्हि ? Where then ? 
सूत्रे In the sutra. 
प्रोक्तादयश्व तद्धिताः 
प्रोक्तादयश्च तद्धिता नोपपद्यन्ते, पाणिनिना प्रोक्तं पाणिनीयम्, आपिशलं काशकृत्स्नम् इति । न हि पाणिनिना शब्दाः प्रोक्ताः । 
74 
PASPAS'AHNIKA 
Besides, the unsuitability of the secondary suffixes used in the sense ‘said by' etc. The secondary suffixes used in the sense ‘said by' etc. in the words Paniniyam - that which is said by Panini-Apisalam, Kasakṛtsnam do not fit in ; for sabdas are not said by Pānini. 
किं तर्हि ? What then? 
सूत्रम् Sūtra. 
किमर्थमिदमुच्यते भवे प्रोक्तादयश्च तद्धिता इति न प्रोक्तादयश्च तद्धिताः इत्येव भवेऽपि तद्धितचोदितः स्यात् ? 
What for have the two-bhave, proktadayaśca taddhitaḥ been said here instead of the latter alone, since it can in- clude the former also? 
पुरस्तादिदमाचार्येण दृष्टम् भवे च तद्धितः इति, तत् पठितम् ; तत उत्तरकाल- मिदं दृष्टं प्रोक्तादयश्च तद्धिताः इति, तदपि पठितम् न चेदानीमाचार्याः सूत्राणि कृत्वा निवर्तयन्ति । 
First this struck Acarya bhave ca taddhitah' and it was read; then was he struck with proktadayaśca taddhitaḥ' and it was read. Acaryas do not stop after writing the sutras without revising them. 
अयं तावददोषः यदुच्यते शब्दे ल्युडर्थः इति । नावश्यं करणाधिकरणयो- रेव ल्युड् विधीयते । 
The objection sabde lyudarthah does not stand, since the suffix ana is not invariably used in the sense of instrument or place of action. 
किं तर्हि ? Where then ?

अन्येष्वपि कारकेषु कृत्यल्युटो बहुलम् इति, तद्यथा प्रस्कन्दनं, प्रपतनम् इति । 
In the meanings of other cases also; it is used to denote apadana as in the words praskandana and prapatana. 
अथवा शब्दैरपि शब्दा व्याकियन्तौ तद्यथा गौरित्युक्ते सर्वे सन्देहा निवर्तन्ते, नाश्वो न गर्दभ इति 
Or words are explained by words-viz. on saying the word gauh, all doubts whether the object denoted is horse or ass are removed.

• Praskandana = the place from which one has slipped ; prapatana = the place from which one has fallen. 
† Here vyakyti does not mean the determination of prakyti and pratyaya, but viparitavyavṛtti and sadysasangraha. 
76 
PASPAS'AHNIKA 
Even then there is this defect that the word vyakarana which denotes a whole cannot denote its part. But one who studies sutras alone is taken to be a vaiyakarana. 
नैष दोषः, समुदायेषु हि शब्दाः प्रवृत्ताः अवयवेष्वपि वर्तन्ते, तद्यथा पूर्वे पञ्चालाः, उत्तरे पञ्चालाः तैलं भुक्तं, घृतं भुक्तं, शुक्लो नीलः कपिलः कृष्ण इति । एवमयं समुदाये व्याकरणशब्दः प्रवृत्तोऽवयवेष्वपि वर्तते । 
It is no defect, for words denoting wholes are used to denote parts also. viz. East Pañcala, North Pañcala, tăila is taken in, ghrta is taken in; white, blue, brown, and black, objects. So also the word vyakarana used here to denote the whole may denote a part also. 
Värttikakāra has thus closed the topic with the conclu- sion that Vyakarana includes lakṣya and lakṣaṇa. Maha- bhāṣyakāra is not satisfied with it and hence reopens the topic and decides that laksana (sutra) alone is denoted by the word vyakarana. 
अथवा पुनरस्तु सूत्रम् Or let it denote only sūtra. 
ननु चोक्तम् सूत्रे व्याकरणे षष्ठ्यर्थोऽनुपपन्नः इति ? 
Has it not been said that if vyakarana denotes sutra, the meaning of the sixth case does not suit? 
नैष दोषः व्यपदेशिवद्भावेन भविष्यति 
F 
The word Рañcila denotes the whole; but in the expressions Púrvě Pañcālāḥ etc. it denotes a part. Taila and ghrta denote medicated oil and ghee, so that they refer to the ingredients also which form a part of them. Though the word sukla denotes only white object, yet it includes also the black border in a white cloth. 

[[7]]

It is no defect. It can be removed by adopting the principle of व्यपदेशिवद्भाव* 
यदप्युच्यते शब्दाप्रतिपत्तिः इति, नहि सूत्रत एव शब्दान् प्रतिपद्यन्ते । किं तर्हि ? व्याख्यानतश्चेति परिहृतमेतत्, तदेव सूत्रं विगृहीतं व्याख्यानं भवतीति । 
The objection sabdapratipattih...vyakhyanatasca' was met by the statement tadeva sutram vigrhitam vyakhyānam bhavati. 
ननु चोक्तं न केवलानि चर्चापदानि व्याख्यानं वृद्धिः आत् ऐज् इति । किं तर्हि, उदाहरणं प्रत्युदाहरणं वाक्याध्याहार इत्येतत्समुदितं व्याख्यानं भवतीति ? 
Has it not been said na kevalani...bhavati'? 
अविजानत एतदेवं भवत । सूत्रत एव हि शब्दान् प्रतिपद्यन्ते । आतश्च सूत्रत एव । यो त्सूत्रं कथयेन्नादो । गृह्येत । 
This is with the dullard; for words are learnt only from sutras. If, on the other hand, one deviates from sutra, the sound alone and not the substance will be taken to account. 
Having thus discussed the meaning of the word Vya- karana, and before handling the first sutra of Acarya Panini, Mahabhāṣyakāra has to deal with the Mahēśvarasutras made use of by Panini and discussed by Värttikakära. He does this in the next ähnika in detail. In order that this 
Cf. Nimittasadbhävät mukhyavyapadesõ yasya asti, sa vyapa- dés'i, yastu vyapadés'ahētvabhävät avidyamanavyapades'ah sa tena tulyam vartaté karyam prati iti vyapades'ivad bhavati iti ucyate (Kai- yata 1-1-5 sútra 21). Though rahu and siras are identical, yet there is the vyavahara "rahossirah" where mind takes rahu to be a whole and s'iras to be a part. So also tho' vyakarana and sutra are identical, yet in the prayoga 'vyakaranasya sutram' the former is taken to be the whole and the latter a part.

ahnika may lead to it, he closes this with the next topic which deals with the Maheśvarasutras as a whole, and which was handled by Värttikakära.

When sounds are known from matrkakṣara, why should Panini have made use of the Mahēśvarasutras ?* 
अथ किमर्थो वर्णानामुपदेशः 
Now what for are the Maheśvarasutras ? 
वृत्तिसमवायार्थ उपदेशः 
वृत्तिसमवायार्थो वर्णानामुपदेशः 
Upadesa is for vṛttisamavaya. Mähēśvarasutras are in- tended to supply different groups of letters suited to Panini's method of composing sutras. 
किमिदं वृत्तिसमवायार्थ इति ? Here what is vṛttisamaväyärtha? 
वृत्तये समवायो वृत्तिसमवायः, वृत्त्यर्थो वा समवायो वृत्तिसमवायः, वृत्तिप्रयोजनो वा समवायो वृत्तिसमवायः । 
Samavaya for vrtti, samavaya for the sake of vrtti and samavaya having for its fruit vrtti.t 
शास्त्रप्रवृत्तिः 
f: What then is vrttih? 
Method of composing sutra (Panini's grammar). 
Even though the literal meaning is this, yet it should be taken to mean why should Panini make use of Mähes'varasutras when there is matṛkāksara. 
It should be noted that vrttisamavaya should have for its vigraha, vṛtteḥ samavayaḥ, Besides it is clear from this statement that the 14 sutras are not the work of Panini. 

[[9]]

अथ कः समवायः What then is samavaya ? वर्णानामानुपूर्व्येण सन्निवेशः 
The grouping of letters in particular settings.

For the sake of anubandhakarana. Mäheśvarasutras are in- tended for anubandha or indicatory letter, so that I may as- sociate them (with other letters). Without the sutras, the letters cannot be associated with indicatory letters (which are called by Panini),

This list of Maheśvarasutras is for vṛttisamavaya and anu- bandhakarana. Vrttisamavaya and anubandhakarana are for pratyahara and pratyahara is to facilitate the making of the sāstra.

For the sake of enumerating the needed ones. Mahéśvara- sutras are needed to give expression to the needed letters so that we may enumerate the needed letters. Without the sutras it is not possible to express the needed letters alone. इष्टबुद्धयर्थश्चेति चेदुदात्तानुदात्तस्वरितानुनासिकदीर्घप्लुतानामप्युपदेशः

If it is said istabuddhyarthasca, upadesa of letters with udatta, anudatta and svarita, accent and the nasalised, long and pluta letters (is needed). If it is said istabuddhyarthasca, letters with udatta, anudatta and svarita accents and the nasalised, long and pluta letters should be read in the 14 sutras, since we need letters having these qualities also. 
आकृत्युपदेशात्सिद्धम्

It is accomplished by taking that the genus of the letters is mentioned. The genus 'a' when pronounced includes the the whole 'a-family'; so is the genus 'i' and the genus 'u'. †

If it is said that it is accomplished by taking the genus, prohibition of samvrta and others. If it is said that it is accomplished by taking the genus, the letters with the defects of samvrta etc. should be prohibited. 
It must be noted that though the genus cannot be pronounced without individuality, yet prominence is given to the genus part of it.

So that the whole words like Garga may be taken to be cor- rect (and not their parts). 
एवं तर्हि अष्टादशधा भिन्नां निवृत्तकलादिकाम् अवर्णस्य प्रत्यापत्तिं वक्ष्यामि । 
If so, sutras इ ई उ उ etc., like अ अ will be read so that each letter may denote only one of the correct eighteen and not the defective ones. 
सा तर्हि वक्तव्या Then should it be read. 
लिङ्गार्था तु प्रत्यापत्तिः 
लिङ्गार्थी सा तर्हि भवति 
The repetition will signify something. It (repetition like इ इ, उ उ ) will, then, have certain significance (that whatever ⚫ defects each letter may have had in prakriyadaśā, it is free 
from them in prayogadasā). 
तत्तर्हि वक्तव्यम् Then should it be read. 
यद्यप्येतदुच्यते, अथवैतर्हि अनेकमनुबन्धशतं नोच्चार्यम्, इत्संज्ञा च न वक्तव्या, लोपश्च न वक्तव्यः । यदनुबन्धैः क्रियते तत्कलादिभिः करिष्यते 
*In the Benares edition it is conjectured that there should be a vārttika समुदायसाधुत्वार्थ तु गर्गादिविदादिपाठः 
+ Cf. अवर्णस्य अअ इति कृतैव, तद्वत् तदनन्तरमन्येषामपि करिष्यामि इति भाव: (Uddyota)

If it is said so, then thousands of anubandhas (like in ) need not be said, they need not be named sutra 
and ट् and the 
g which enjoins their löpa need not be read. 
सिध्यत्येवम् । अपाणिनीयं तु भवति । यथान्यासमेवास्तु । 
The object is then accomplished; but it goes against Panini's sutras. Hence let the sutras be as they are. 
ननु चोक्तम् ‘आकृत्युपदेशात्सिद्धमिति चेत्संवृतादीनां प्रतिषेधः" इति 
Has it not been said that, if everything is accomplished by akṛtyupadesa, prohibition of samvṛta and others is to be made. 
परिहृतमेतत् —गर्गादिविदादिपाठात् संवृतादीनां निवृत्तिर्भविष्यति इति 
That objection has been met by the statement that the defects-samvṛta and others are avoided by gargadibidādi- 
pātha. 
ननु चान्यद् गर्गादिविदादिपाठे प्रयोजनमुक्तम् ! 
Oh! another was said to be the purpose served by gargadi- bidadipātha. 
किम् ? What ? 
समुदायानां साधुत्वं यथा स्यादिति 
So that the whole words may be taken to be correct. 
एवं तर्हि उभयमनेन क्रियते, पाठश्चैव विशेप्यते, कलादयश्च निवर्त्यन्ते 
If so, both are accomplished by it-the correct reading is understood and the defects are removed. 
कथं पुनरेकेन यत्नेनोभयं लभ्यम् ? 
How can both be accomplished through one effort? 
84 
PASPAS'AHNIKA 
लभ्यमित्याह Can be accomplished, says he. 
कथम्? How? 
द्विगता अपि हेतवो भवन्ति । तद्यथा— आम्राश्च सिक्ताः पितरश्च प्रीणिता इति तथा वाक्यानि द्विष्ठानि भवन्ति- श्वेतो धावति, अलम्बुसानां याता इति । 
There are causes which have two effects:-viz., Mango trees are watered and manes are satisfied. So also are sentences having two meanings-viz., Sveto dhāvati (white man cleans; dog runs from here); alambusānām yātā. (He who goes to alambusā; one that can get the colour of straw). 
अथवा इदं तावदयं प्रष्टव्यः — केमे संवृतादयः श्रूयेरन्निति । 
Or he is to be put this question, "where can be heard the defective sounds like samvṛta?" 
आगमेषु In augments. 
आगमाः शुद्धाः पठ्यन्ते Augments are correctly read. विकारेषु तर्हि If so, in adesas. 
विकारा अपि शुद्धाः पठ्यन्ते Adeśas also are correctly read. 
प्रत्ययेषु तर्हि If so, in pratyayas. 
प्रत्यया अपि शुद्धाः पञ्चन्ते 
Even pratyayas are correctly read. 
धातुषु तर्हि In roots then. 
धातवोऽपि शुद्धाः पठ्यन्ते Even roots are correctly read. प्रातिपदिकेषु तर्हि In stems then. 
。 बुसानाम् = पलाल चूर्णानाम् (Annambhatta) पलालवणानाम् (Nagojibhatta) 

[[5]]

प्रातिपदिकान्यपि शुद्धानि पठ्यन्ते Even stems are correctly read. यानि तर्ह्यग्रहणानि प्रातिपदिकानि ? 
Those stems which are not derivable from roots? 
एतेषामपि स्वरवर्णानुपूर्वीज्ञानार्थ उपदेशः कर्तव्यः, शशः षष इति मा भूत्, पलाशः पलाष इति मा भूतु, मञ्चको मञ्जक इति मा भूत् 
Enumeration of such stems also need be made so that the nature and order of sounds in them may be known and T, पलाश, and मञ्चक may not be misread as पप, पलाय and मञ्जक respectively. 
आगमाश्च विकाराश्च प्रत्ययाः सह धातुभिः । उच्चार्यन्ते ततस्तेषु नेमे प्राप्ताः कलादयः ॥ 
Augments, substitutes and suffixes are correctly read with roots. Hence there is no opportunity for the defects like kala to happen there. 
From the above it is clear that the objection “इष्टबुद्धयर्थ- श्चेति... उपदेशः " does not stand. Hence इष्टबुद्धयथैश्च need not be mentioned as a prayojana.. 
इति श्रीमद्भगवत्पतञ्जलिविरचिते महाभाष्ये प्रथमाध्यायस्य प्रथमपादे प्रथममाह्निकम् ॥ 
Paspasahnikat ends. 
* Cf. वर्णोपदेशास्य मुख्यं फलं तु प्रत्याहारनिष्यत्तिः (Sabdakaustubha). † Annambhatta in his Uddyotana has quoted a verse which says. that the word paspasa means upodghata or introduction. 
शास्त्रस्यारम्भको ग्रन्थ उपोद्घात इतीरितः । 
स एव ग्रन्थसन्दर्भः पस्पशः कथितो बुधैः ॥ 
He has mentioned the word : in the masculine gender. But Nagöjibhatta has mentioned पस्पशा in the feminine gender. Cf. अत एव पस्पशायाम् भाष्ये (Laghumañjūsa) under the topic बुद्धवाक्यं न प्रमाणम् in तिर्थ- निरूपण. 
86 
2. प्रत्याहाराह्निकम् 
Having dealt with the use of the fourteen Mäheśvarasutras in toto at the end of the previous ahnika, Mahābhāṣyakāra deals with the following eight sutras in detail in this ähnika:- अइउण्, ऋलक्, एओड़ ऐआँच, हयवरट्, लण्, ञमङणनम् and झभञ्. Hence this āhnika is called प्रत्याहाराह्निकम्. 
अ इ उ ण् 
There are three topics in this sutra. There should be vivṛtō- padeśa (1) in अ of अइउण्, (2) in अ of roots, stems etc. and (3) in अ of the sutras like अस्य च्वौ, यस्येति च. 
अकारस्य विवृतोपदेश आकारग्रहणार्थः 
I 
अकारस्य विवृतोपदेशः कर्तव्यः । किं प्रयोजनम् आकारग्रहणार्थ ः– अकारः सवर्णग्रहणेन आकारमपि यथा गृह्णीयात् 
The vivṛtopadesa of akara is to comprehend ākāra also. The vivrtopadesa of akara is necessary. Why? For the sake of comprehending akara-so that akara may compre- hend ākāra by the sutra अणुदित्सवर्णस्य चाप्रत्ययः which enables अण् and उदित् to comprehend savarnas. 
● This sentence may be interpreted in two ways : - (1) The vivrti- padesa suggested by the sutra 'अ अ' is necessary or (2) vivrtópa- desa must be enjoined to . In the latter case both vivṛtopades'a and its reason are enjoined and in the former case the reason alone. 

[[7]]

किं च कारणं न गृह्णीयात् ? 
Why will it not comprehend? 
विवारभेदात् 
By the difference in their abhyantara-prayatna. 
किमुच्यते विवारभेदादिति न पुनः कालभेदादपि यथैव ह्ययं विवारभिन्नः एवं कालमिन्नोऽपि ? 
How is it that mention is made of the difference in abhyantaraprayatna alone and not of the difference in matra also, since it (akara) differs from akara in matrā in the same way as it differs from it in abhyantaraprayatna? 
सत्यमेवमेतत् ; वक्ष्यति “ तुल्यास्यप्रयत्नं सवर्णम्" इत्यत्र आस्यग्रहणस्य प्रयोजनम् 'आस्ये येषां तुल्यो देशः प्रयत्नश्च ते सवर्णसंज्ञा भवन्ति इति ; बाह्यश्च पुनरास्यात्कालः ", तेन स्यादेव कालभिन्नस्य ग्रहणं न पुनर्विवारभिन्नस्य । 
True, so is it; Mahābhāṣyakara is going to say in the bhāsya under the sutra तुल्यास्यप्रयत्नं सवर्णम् that the need for the word are in the sutra is to suggest that only such sounds as have the same place of articulation and the man- ner of articulation within the mouth become savarnas. Quantity of a sound is determined outside the mouth. Hence one sound can comprehend another having different quant- ity but not having different abhyantaraprayatna. 
किं पुनरिदं विवृतस्योपदिश्यमानस्य प्रयोजनमन्वाख्यायते, आहोस्वित् संवृतस्यो- पदिश्यमानस्य विवृतोपदेशश्चोद्यते ! 
नाभिप्रदेश एवं विशिष्टप्रयत्नारम्भात् दीर्घादिनिष्पत्त्या नाभेव आस्यात् बाह्यत्वात् कालस्य बाह्य- त्वम् (Kaiyata). नाभिप्रदेश एव वायोः प्रकारप्रयत्नमारभ्यते इति कालस्य बाह्यत्वम् अस्त्येव (Pra- dipika) 
इदम् = अत्र Cf. इदमहमभुमवबाध (शतपथब्राह्मणम् 1. 35.7).

PRATYĀHĀRĀHNIKA-अइउण 
Is it here that the purpose of vivrtopadesa is enumerated or that vivrtopadesa is enjoined to that which has samurtōpa- desa ? 
विवृतस्योपदिश्यमानस्य प्रयोजनमन्वाख्यायते 
The purpose of vivrtopadesa is enumerated. 
कथं ज्ञायते ? How is it so interpreted ? 
यदयम् अ अ इत्यकारस्य विवृतस्य संवृतताप्रत्यापत्तिं शास्ति 
Since the Sutrakāra enjoins in the sutra & that the vivṛta- akara becomes samvrta by the pratyapatti. 
नैतदस्ति ज्ञापकम् अस्ति ह्यन्यदेतस्य वचने प्रयोजनम् 
This sutra does not suggest it; for another purpose is serv- ed by it. 
किम् ? What is it? 
अतिख : अतिमालः इत्यत्र आन्तर्यतो विवृतस्य विवृतः प्राप्नोति, संवृतः स्यादि- त्येवमर्था प्रत्यापत्तिः 
Vivrta-akāra will replace vivrta-ākara in the words अतिखदवः and अतिमालः on account of similarity; the pratyāpatti is for the sake of samvrta-akara replacing vivrta-ākāra in them. 
नैतदस्ति ; नैव लोके न च वेदे अकारो विवृतोऽस्ति 
No, that cannot be ; there is no vivrta-akāra either in ordi- nary usage or in Věda. 
कस्तर्हि 
If so, which is it (that is found in loka or Veda ) ? 
It may be interesting to note that a is now pronounced in Southern India only as an open sound and it may be due to the influence of the pronunciation of a in Tamil language. 
89 

[[2]]

संवृतः । योऽस्ति स भविष्यति । तदेतत्प्रत्यापत्तिवचनं ज्ञापकमेव भविष्यति विवृतस्योपदिश्यमानस्य प्रयोजनमन्वाख्यायत इति 
Sainvrta-akara. That which is, appears there. Hence the statement of pratyapatti suggests that the purpose of vivṛtopadesa is enumerated. 
कः पुनरत्र विशेषः विवृतस्योपदिश्यमानस्य प्रयोजनमन्वाख्यायेत, संवृतस्योपदिश्य- मानस्य वा विवृतोपदेशः चोद्येत इति ? 
What is the speciality here whether it is taken that the pur- pose of vivṛtopadesa is enumerated or that vivrtopadesa is enjoined to that which has samvrtopadesa? 
न खलु कश्चिद्विशेषः; आहोपुरुषिकामात्रं तु भवानाह संवृतस्योपदिश्यमानस्य विवृतोपदेशश्चोद्यते इति, वयं तु ब्रूमः विवृतस्योपदिश्यमानस्य प्रयोजनमन्वाख्यायत इति No speciality whatsoever; it is only conceit; you say that vivṛtopadesa is enjoined to that which has samvṛtopadesa and we say that the purpose of vivṛtopadesa is enumerated. 
II 
तस्य विवृतोपदेशादन्यत्रापि विवृतोपदेशः सवर्णग्रहणार्थः 
तस्यैतस्याक्षरसमाम्न्नायिकस्य विवृतोपदेशादन्यत्रापि विवृतोपदेशः कर्तव्यः 
On account of its vivrtopadesa, there is need for vivrtopa- desa elsewhere to comprehend like sounds. Since there has been vivṛtopudesa in the akara of age of the Maheśvara- sutras, there is need to declare vivrtopadesa elsewhere also. 
कान्यत्र ? Which does elsewhere refer to ? 
प्रत्यापत्तिः = Reversion to original state.

सवर्णग्रहणार्थः, आक्षरसमाम्नायिकेनास्य ग्रहणं यथा स्यात् 
So that it may comprehend like sounds. So that this may be comprehended by the akara of Maheśvarasutras. 
किं च कारणं न स्यात् ? 
Why will it not be comprehended 
विवार भेदादेव 
Evidently through the difference in the abhyantaraprayatna.

Acarya's usage suggests that the akara of dhātu, etc., is comprehended by that in Mäheśvarasutras since he uses the word akah in the sutra अकः सवर्णे दीर्घः 
कथं कृत्वा ज्ञापकम् ? 
How is it to be interpreted so that it may become a jñāpaka? 
न हि द्वयोराक्षरसमाम्न्नायिकयोर्युगपत्समवस्थानमस्ति 
For two akuras do not exist simultaneously in Mäheśvara- sutras. 
नैतदस्ति ज्ञापकम् अस्ति ह्यन्यदेतस्य वचने प्रयोजनम् 
This cannot become a jñāpaka, for there is another purpose served by the use of this akah. 

[[1]]

किम् ? What is it ? 
यस्याक्षरसमाम्नायिकेन ग्रहणमस्ति तदर्थमेतत्स्यात् खट्वाढकं, मालाढकम् इति 
It is used where it can be applied to the akaras comprehend- ed by a in the Māheśvarasutras viz., खद्वाढकम्, मालाढकम्." 
सति प्रयोजने न ज्ञापकं भवति, तस्मात् विवृतोपदेशः कर्तव्यः 
If there is a prayojana, it does not become a jñāpaka and hence there is need for vivṛtopadesa. 
कि एष यलश्धोद्यते विवृतोपदेशो नाम, विवृतो वा उपदिश्येत संवृतो वा, को न्वत्र विशेषः ? 
What for is this attempt about vivrtopadesa? Let vivṛtopa- desa be made or samvṛtopadesa; what is the difference? 
स एष सर्व एवमर्थो यत्नः क्रियते, यान्येतानि प्रातिपदिकान्यग्रहणानि तेषामेतेना- भ्युपायेन उपदेशश्चोद्यते, तद् गुरु भवति । तस्माद्वक्तव्यं धात्वादिस्थच विवृत इति 
All this attempt is made for the sake of non-derivable stems. If this vivṛtopadesa is not made, all such stems will have to be read and it will be a stupendous task. Hence the akara of dhatu etc., should have vivrtopadesa. 
दीर्घप्लुतवचने च संवृतनिवृत्यर्थः 
दीर्घप्लुतवचने च संवृतनिवृत्त्यर्थो विवृतोपदेशः कर्तव्यः, दीर्घप्लुतौ संवृतौ मा भूताम् इति वृक्षाभ्यां देवदत्ता ३ इति 
To ward off samvṛtatva in the long and pluta sounds. There is need for vivrtopadesa to ward off samvrtatva in long and 
It may be applied where & and d coalesce, since a is comprehended by the a of अइउण् on the strength of the sūtra अणुदित्सवर्णस्य चाप्रत्ययः 
This question is based upon the assumption that the akara in dhatu etc., is read with vivrtaprayatna. 
92 
PRATYĀHĀRĀHNIKA-अइउण 
pluta sounds (i.e.) that long and pluta sounds in words like वृक्षाभ्यां देवदत्ता ३ may not become sanvrta. 
नैव लोके न च वेदे दीर्घप्लुतौ संवृतौ स्तः 
Neither in usage nor in Veda are long and pluta sounds closed ones. 
कौ तर्हि ? What then? 
विवृतौ यौ स्तः तौ भविष्यतः 
Open ones; those that are will certainly appear. 
स्थानी प्रकल्पयेदेतावनुस्वारो यथा यणम् 
संवृतः स्थानी संवृतौ दीर्घप्लुतौ प्रकल्पयेत्, अनुस्वारः यथा यणम्, तद्यथा सय्यन्ता सव्र्व्वत्सरः, यल्लोकं, तल्लोकम् इति; अनुस्वारः स्थानी यणमनुनासिकं प्रकल्पयति । 
Sthanin will produce these two as anusvara brings in nasal- ised semivowels. The closed sthanin will bring in closed long and pluta sounds as anusvära brings in nasalised semi- vowels. viz, सय्यन्ता, सव्र्व्वत्सरः, यलोकम्, तल्लोकम्. The sthānin which is anusvära brings in nasalised semivowels. 
विषम उपन्यासः, युक्तं यत्सतस्तत्र प्रक्लप्तिर्भवति; सन्ति हि यणः सानुना- सिका निरनुनासिकाश्च; दीर्घप्लुतौ पुननैव लोके न च वेदे संवृतौ स्तः 
The reasoning is not sound. It is but just to bring in what exists; there are semivowels both nasalised and non-nasal- ised; but the long and pluta sounds are closed ones neither in usage nor in Veda. 
कौ तर्हि ? What then ? 
विवृतौ । यौ स्तः तौ भविष्यतः 
Open sounds. Those that are will appear. 

[[3]]

एवमपि कुत एतत् तुल्यस्थानौ प्रयत्नभिन्नौ भविष्यतः, न पुनस्तुल्यप्रयत्नौ स्थान- भिन्नौ स्याताम् ईकार ऊकारो वेति. 
Granting this, how is it that only those that have the same organ of articulation but different prayatnas are taken to be like sounds and not those who have the same prayatna but different organs of articulation, like i and u? 
वक्ष्यति स्थानेन्तरतमः इत्यत्र स्थान इत्यनुवर्तमाने पुनः स्थानेग्रहणस्य प्रयोजनं यत्र अनेकविधमान्तर्य तत्र स्थानतः आन्तर्य बलीयो भवतीति । 
He is going to say in the bhāsya under the sūtra स्थानेऽन्तर- तमः that, though the word स्थाने can be taken there to follow from the sūtra पष्ठी स्थानेयोगा, the mention of स्थाने there sug- gests that, of the many kinds of relationships, that from the organ of articulation predominates.

तत्रानुवृत्तिनिर्देशे सवर्णाग्रहणमनत्वात 
तत्र अनुवृत्तिनिर्देशे सवर्णानां ग्रहणं न प्राप्नोति अस्य च्चौ यस्येति च । किं कारणम् ? अनत्वात् न ह्येते अणः येऽनुवृत्तौ 
There in the akara as in as there cannot be savarna- grahana since it is not an an. There in the sutras अस्य च्वी, यत्येति च where there is the mention of akāra as in अइउण् of the Mahesvarasutras, it cannot comprehend like sounds. Why? Since it does not come under the pratyāhāra an Those which are in anuvṛtti are not anah. 
स्थानत एवान्तर्य बलीयो यथा स्यात् is another reading. 
↑ अनुवृत्तिनिर्देश: वृतिं वर्णसमाम्नायम् अनुगतः तत्सदृशः अनुवृत्तिः अकारादिः, तस्य निर्देशः स्वरूपेण उच्चारणम् इत्यर्थः (उद्योत under अणुदित्सवर्णस्य चाप्रत्ययः )

PRATYĀHĀRĀHNIKA-अइउण् 
के तर्हि ? 
If so, which are anah ? 
येऽक्षरसमाम्नाये उपदिश्यन्ते 
Those that are read in Mahesvarasutras. 
एकत्वादकारस्य सिद्धम् 
एकोऽयमकारो यश्चाक्षरसमाम्नाये यश्चानुवृत्तौ यश्च धात्वादिस्थः 
The point is achieved on account of oneness of akara. This akara is one whether it is in अड्डण, अस्य च्वौ etc., or in dhātu 
etc. 
अनुबन्धसंकरस्तु 
अनुबन्धसंकरस्तु प्राप्नोति कर्मण्यण, आतोऽनुपसर्गे कः इति, केऽपि णित्कृतं प्राप्नोति Confusion in the effect of anubandhas. There will arise con- fusion in the effect of the different anubandhas. For in- stance, the operation of the sūtras कर्मण्यण् and आतोऽनुपसर्गे कः will be so confused that the effect of for will be found in कित्. 
एकाजनेकाज्ग्रहणेषु चानुपपत्तिः 
एकाजनेकाज्ग्रहणेषु चानुपपत्तिर्भवति 
Also the inapplicability of the sutras dealing with ekac and anekāc. There will arise inapplicability of the sutras deal- ing with words having one vowel and those having many vowels. 
तत्र को दोषः ? What will be the harm there? 
भविष्यति is another reading. The word एकाच् generally means a syllable, but here it means a vowel. 

[[5]]

किरिणा गिरिणा इत्येकाज्लक्षणमन्तोदात्तत्वं प्राप्नोति, इह च घटेन तरति घटिक इति व्यलक्षणः ष्ठन् न प्राप्नोति 
In the words किरिणा and गिरिणा the final syllable will be accented since there is only one vowel i in both. So also the pratyaya ika (sthan) which is enjoined after a word hav- ing two vowels cannot appear after the word a so that the word af used in the sense of one who crosses with the help of a pot cannot be formed. 
द्रव्यवच्चोपचाराः 
द्रव्यवच्चोपचाराः प्राप्नुवन्ति । तद्यथा - द्रव्येषु नैकेन घटेन अनेको युगपत्कार्य करोति; एवम् इममकारं नानेको युगपदुच्चारयेत् 
Applications as in dravyas. Applications have to be done as in the case of dravyas. As many cannot simultaneously make use of one pot among dravyas, so also many cannot pronounce this akara simultaneously. 
The three objections raised against the statement एकत्वा- दकारस्य सिद्धम् are answered as follows:-- 
विषयेण तु नानालिङ्गकरणात्सिद्धम् 
यदयं विषये विषये नानालिङ्गमकारं करोति — कर्मण्यण, आतोऽनुपसर्गे कः इति तेन ज्ञायते नानुबन्धसङ्करोऽस्तीति । यदि हि स्यात् नानालिङ्गकरणमनर्थकं स्यात्, एक- मेवायं सर्वगुणमुच्चारयेत् 
The point is achieved on account of the different indications in each place. Since the Acarya makes different indications in each place like 'ण्' in कर्मण्यण् and क् in आतोऽनुपसर्गे कः, it is learnt that there is no confusion in the effect of anubandhas. Had there been any confusion, the reading of different indi- cations will be of no avail; he would have read only one akara with all anubandhas. 
96 
PRATYĀHĀRAHNIKA-अइउण् 
नैतदस्ति ज्ञापकम् इत्संज्ञाप्रक्लृप्त्यर्थमेतत्स्यात् ; न ह्ययमनुबन्धैः शल्यकव- च्छक्य उपचेतुम् इत्संज्ञायां हि दोषः स्यात्, आयम्य हि द्वयोरित्संज्ञा स्यात् । कयोः ! आद्यन्तयोः 
This is not a jñāpaka since it is intended to enable them get the designation of ; for it is not possible to heap anubandhas like porcupine (its quills), since in such a case there will be difficulty in getting the designation of ; all being put together, the designation of is possible only for two. For which two ? For the initial and the final sounds. 
एवं तर्हि, 
विषयेण तु पुनर्लिङ्गकरणात्सिद्धम्

If so, the point is achieved on account of the repetition of the same indicator in different places, like अन् in प्रग्दीव्यतोऽथ् शिवादिभ्योऽण्. Hence it is understood that there is no anu- bandha-saikara. If it were, the repetition of the same anubandha will be of no avail. 
* अथवा पुनरस्तु 
विषयेण तु नानालिङ्गकरणात्सिद्धम् 
इत्येव 
Or let it be that the point is achieved on account of the diffe- rent indicators in each place. 
* This argument is perhaps Mahābhāsyakāra's own.

13LECTURES. ON PATANJALI'S MAHĀBHĀSYA 
ननु चोक्तम् — इत्संज्ञाप्रक्लृप्त्यर्थमेतत् स्यात् इति ? 
Has it not been said that it is intended to enable them get the designation of इत् ? 
नैष दोषः । लोकत एतत्सिद्धम् । तद्यथा लोके कश्चिदेवं देवदत्तमाह-दह मुण्डो भव, इह जटिलो भव, इह शिखी भव, इति यल्लिङ्गो यत्रोच्यते तल्लिङ्गस्तत्रोप- तिष्ठते । एवमयमकारो यलिङ्गो यत्रोच्यते तल्लिङ्गस्तत्रोपस्थास्यते । 
No, that objection cannot stand. The purpose is achieved as it is in the world. For instance we see in the world one telling Devadatta, "Appear here with a shaven head, appear here with matted hair, appear here with a tuft" and Devadatta coming there with that particular mark. So also it is only that akara having the mentioned indicator appears on the scene. 
यदप्युच्यते ' एकाजनेकाज्ग्रहणेषु चानुपपत्तिः' इति, 
एकाजनेकाज्ग्रहणेषु चावृत्तिसंख्यानात् 
एकाजनेकाज्ग्रहणेषु चावृत्तेः संख्यानादनेकाच्त्वं भविष्यति । तद्यथा 'सप्तदश सामिधेन्यो भवन्ति' इति, 'त्रिः प्रथमामन्वाह त्रिरुत्तमाम्' इत्यावृत्तितः सप्तदशत्वं भवति । एवमिहाप्यावृत्तितोऽनेकाच्त्वं भविष्यति 
The objection that was raised about the inapplicability of the sutras dealing with ekac and anekac is met thus-by counting the repeated sound in the sutras dealing with ēkāc and anekāc. Anekactva is accomplished in the sutras dealing with ekac and anekac by counting the repeated sounds. For instance samidheni rks are counted as seventeen (though they are only thirteen in number) by reading the first and the last rks thrice each. So also anekactva is accomplished here by the repetition of the same sound.

From the world. A thousand of seers get the fruit of having given away in charity thousand cows though there is only one brown cow, each giving her thousand times (by purchasing it back every time from the recipient). So also anekactva is accomplished here.

which is not possible for many to handle simultaneously, but in cases where many can handle the same thing at the same time it is not true. For instance the seeing of a pot or the touching of it. The pronouncing of akāra is thus possible ; many pro- nounce it at the same time. 
From the above it is clear that all the objections raised against the statement एकत्वादकारस्य सिद्धम् have been satis- factorily answered. Henceforth another set of objections is thrown against the same statement. 
आन्यभाव्यं तु कालशब्दव्यवायात् 
आन्यभाव्यं त्वकारस्य, कुतः : कालशब्दव्यवायात्— कालव्यवायात् शब्द- व्यवायाच्च ; कालव्यवायात् दण्ड- अग्रम् ; शब्दव्यवायात् दण्डः । न चैकस्यात्मनो व्यवायेन भवितव्यम् ; भवति चेद्भवत्यान्यभाव्यमकारस्य 
No, there is the state of being different on account of the intervention of time and sound. There is the state of being different in akara. Why? On account of the intervention of time and sound-on account of the intervention of time and on account of the intervention of sound-viz. दण्ड-अग्रम्, दण्डः There is no intervention for the same sound. If there is inter- vention, they are different.

On account of its being found simultaneously in different places. Since the akára is found in different places at the same time,

PRATYĀHĀRĀHNIKA-अइउण् 
we think they are different. It is found in different places at the same time in the words अभ्वः, अर्कः, अर्थः, The same Dēva- datta cannot remain at the same time at Srughna and at Mathurā.

If these sounds are like birds. Just as the birds that seat themselves first in a row quickly fly from their places and seat themselves last, so also the akāra is first found after 'द्' and then after 'ण्डू'

No, this is not possible, for in that case words will become anitya. They are, on the other hand, nitya and so words should have sounds which do not move, change and which are neither replaced nor augmented. If the 'a' which is seen after- ‘d' is afterwards seen after 'nd', it cannot be considered Tecūtastha.

If these sounds are taken to be like the sun. The one sun in different places is seen simultaneously. 
विषम उपन्यासः, नैको द्रष्टा आदित्यमनेकाधिकरणस्थं युगपद्देशपृथक्त्वेषूपलभते, अकारं पुनरुपलभते ॥ 
The reasoning is not sound. The same observer does not see the sun in different places at the same time; but he sees so akāra, on the other hand. 
अकारमपि नोपलभते 
He does not see akāra also. 
किं कारणम् ? Why ?

is one. 
आकाशदेशा अपि बहवः, यावता बहवः तस्मादान्यभाव्यमकारस्य 
The ākāśadesas also are many. Since they are many, the many-ness of akāra should be conceded.

रूपसामान्याद्वा 
रूपसामान्याद्वा सिद्धमेतत् । तद्यथा 'तानेव शाटकानाच्छादयामः ये मथुरा- याम् ' ' तानेव शालीन् भुञ्ज्महे ये मगधेषु', 'तदेवेदं भवतः कार्षापणं यन्मधुरायां गृहीतम्', अन्यस्मिश्चान्यस्मिन् रूपसामान्यात्तदेवेदमिति भवति । एवमिहापि रूप- सामान्यात् सिद्धम् || 
Or by the similarity of shape. 
This is achieved even by the similarity of shape. For ins-- tance even though objects are different, they are taken to be one from similarity of shape and hence we see the following usage :- We dress ourselves with the same dress as at Mathura; we eat the same rice as at Magadha; this is the same coin as was received at Mathura. So also our object is achieved here by taking the akaras to be one from similarity of shape. 
The topics II and III are based on व्यक्तिपक्ष. The objec- tions raised in the third topic were finally answered by first taking recourse to जातिपक्ष in the statement आकृतिग्रहणात्सिद्धम् and then to व्यक्तिपक्ष in the satement रूपसामान्याहा. 
Nágojibhatta says 'अकारव्यक्तीनामानन्त्यमाश्रित्य वार्तिककृता वर्ण- समाम्नायस्थस्य विवृतत्वेऽपि धात्वादिस्थस्यापि विवृतोपदेशो नोदितः ; भाष्य- कृता तु प्रयोगस्थानां प्रत्याहारस्थैः ग्रहणाय तत्र जातिनिर्देशे आवश्यके जाते- विवृतत्वप्रतिज्ञानेनैव सर्वसिद्धेः स दोषो वारितः । But on looking at the vārttika "सवर्णे ऽण् ग्रहणमपरिभाष्यमाकृतिग्रहणात् " under the sūtra 'अणुदित्सवर्णस्य चाप्रत्ययः' it seems that Vārttikakāra himself has given expression to जातिपक्ष. Perhaps the statement रूपसामान्याद्वा may be Mahabhāṣyakāra's own, since, wherever he deals with the interpretation of the word आकृति, he takes it in both the senses of jāti and shape.

Mention is made of ऌ for the sake of यदृच्छाशब्द, अशक्तिजानुकरण- शब्द and प्लुत्यादि. First for the sake of यद्दच्छाशब्द (i.e.) word coined at random to name a person or object without its being formed from any root. One is named . When that word is used, the vowel-laws have to operate, viz. दध्यूऌतकाय (दधि +ऌतकाय) देहि, मध्लुतकाय (मधु लतकाय) देहि, उदङ्ऌतकः

The benefits were enumerated on the basis of one view and refutation is made on the basis of another view (i.e.) the benefits were enumerated on the strength of the view that there are yadrechasabdas and the refutation is on the strength of the view that there are no yadrechasabdas. A grammatically correct word can make one avoid another considered to be incorrect only if both have the same प्रवृत्तिनिमित्त* ; for instance the word Devadatta can be the correct form of Devadinna and not gāvyādi.

Imitation is either of the enjoined ones, which is good, or of that which is neither enjoined nor prohibited, which brings in neither demerit nor merit. As is found in those of the world and the Vedas-as is found in the incidents of the world and the Vēdas. First in the world-he too who, seeing that another gives away in charity, performs sacrifices and studies the Vedas, imitates him and gives away in charity, performs sacrifices and studies the Vedas gets merit. In the Vedas also-he who seeing Visvasris performing sattras imitates them and performs sattras, he too gets merit. That which is neither enjoined nor prohi- bited is illustrated thus-he who seeing another hiccoughing, laughing or scratching in a peculiar fashion imitates him and hiccoughs, laughs or scratches in the same way gets neither merit nor demerit. Similarly he who seeing another killing a brahmin in a particular way and drinking wine in a peculiar fashion imitates him, kills a brahmin and drinks wine is, in my opinion, an apostate. 
विषम उपन्यासः । यश्चैवं हन्ति यश्चानुहन्ति उभौ तौ हतः, यश्चापि पिवति यश्चानुपिवति उभौ तौ पिबतः । यस्तु खलु एवमसौ ब्राह्मणं हन्ति एवमसौ सुरां वा

पिवतीति तस्यानुकुर्वन् स्नातानुलिप्तः माल्यगुणकण्ठः कदलीस्तम्भं छिन्द्यात् पयो वा पिबेत् न स मन्ये पतितः स्यात् । 
The argument is not sound. He who kills thus and he who kills in imitation both kill; he who drinks (wine) and he who drinks (wine) in imitation, both drink ( wine ). But, on the other hand, he who seeing another killing a brahmin cuts a plantain tree in the same way after taking a bath besmearing himself with sandal and wearing a garland in his neck or he who seeing another drinking wine drinks milk in the same way is not, in my opinion, an apostate. 
एवमिहापि य एवमसौ अपशब्द प्रयुङ्क्ते इति तस्यानुकुर्वन्नपशब्दं प्रयुञ्जीत सोऽप्यपशब्दभाक् स्यात् । अयं तु अन्योऽपशब्दपदार्थकः शब्दो यदर्थ उपदेशः कर्तव्यः । न चापशब्दपदार्थकः शब्दोऽपशब्दो भवति । अवश्यं चैतदेवं विज्ञेयम्, यो हि मन्यते अपशब्दपदार्थकः शब्दोऽपशब्दो भवतीति, अपशब्द इत्येव तस्यापशब्दः स्यात्, न चैषोऽपशब्दः 
So also here he who seeing another using ungrammatical words uses the same gets demerit. This word is another which con- notes the ungrammatical word, for which upadeśa is necessary.

The word which connotes an incorrect word is not incorrect. This should be clearly understood that he who thinks that the word which connotes an incorrect word is incorrect should have to say that the word is ungrammatical, which is not the case. 
Mahābhāsyakāra, taking recourse to the nyāya तुष्यतु दुर्जनः proceeds thus:- 
अयं खल्वपि भूयोऽनुकरणशब्दोऽपरिहार्यः यदर्थ उपदेशः कर्तव्यः-साल- कारमधीते मध्वऌकारमधीते इति 
Again this अनुकरणशब्द cannot be avoided for which ऌ should be read in the sūtra सावकारमधीते, मध्यकारमधीते. 
कस्थस्य पुनरेतदनुकरणम् ? 
Where is this which is imitated found? 
क्लपिस्थस्य 
In the word क्लृप्. 
यदि क्लपिस्थस्य, क्लपेश्च लत्वमसिद्धम्, तस्य असिद्धत्वात् ऋकार एवाच्का- 
र्याणि भविष्यन्ति 
If it is of 4, the of is asiddha and hence the vowel- laws operate to ऋ. 
Granting that the imitation of an incorrect word is also incorrect, 
well and that has to operate 
he says that when one has to say that one studies one studies in a fine manner, the sutraq and hence ऌ should find a place in the sūtra लुक्.

In the expression द्विः पचन्तु इत्याह the verb पचन्तु should have ell its syllables unaccented by the operation of the rule तिङतिङः. In the expression अनी इत्याह, अग्नी should get the प्रगृह्यसंज्ञा by the operation of the rule ईदूदेद्विवचनं प्रगृह्यम्. 
यदि प्रकृतिवदनुकरणं भवतीत्युच्यते अपशब्द एवासौ भवति कुमार्यऌतक इत्याह ब्राह्मण्युऌतक इत्याह, अपशब्दो अस्य प्रकृतिः । न चापशब्दः प्रकृतिः, न खपशब्दा उपदिश्यन्ते, न चानुपदिष्टा प्रकृतिरस्ति । 
If the principle प्रकृतिवदनुकरणम् is conceded, the word लुतक in the expressions कुमार्य्ऌतक इत्याह, ब्राह्मण्य्स्तक इत्याह will become an apasabda, since its fa is apasabda. Apasabda cannot be taken as prakrti; for apasabdas are not read, and that which is not read is not prakrti. 
बक्तव्यम् is another reading.

PRATYĀHĀRĀHNIKA-ऋलुक् 
From the above it is clear that, according to Värttikakāra, imitator also is apasabda and hence need not be read in the sutra on that score. According to Mahabhaṣyakara, imitator of an apaśabda is not an apaśabda and the principle प्रकृतिवदनु- करणं भवति cannot operate here and hence ऌ should be read in the sūtra. 
Having refuted the first two, he takes the third point for review.

नैष दोषः, वक्ष्यत्येतत् श्वादीनां प्रसारणे नकारान्तग्रहणम नकारान्तप्रति- पेधार्थम् इति, (Vārttika under VI-4-133) तत्प्रकृतमुत्तरत्रानुवर्तिष्यते, अल्लो- पोऽनः (VI. 4. 134) नकारान्तस्येति 
It is no harm. He (Vārttikakāra) is going to say this that the comprehension of नकारान्त in the sūtra श्वयुवमघोनामतद्धिते (VI-4-133) dealing with the सम्प्रसारण of श्वन् etc. is to prohibit those which are not नकारान्त. The same नकारान्तस्य is repeated in the following sūtra अल्लोपोऽनः 
इह तर्हि क्ऌ ३तशिख, अनृत इति प्रतिषेधः प्राप्नोति 
In the case of क्ल३तशिखः, then, the prohibition by अनुतः (in the sītra गुरोरनृतोऽनन्त्यस्य . VII-2-86) will operate. 
रवत्प्रतिषेधाच्च 
By the prohibition of those which have r. 
रवत्प्रतिषेधाच्चैतत्सिध्यति गुरोररवतः इति वक्ष्यामि 
Then the desired object is accomplished by prohibiting those which have r and hence I shall read अरवतः instead of अनुतः 
in that sutra. 
यद्यरवत इत्युच्यते होतृ ऋकारः होत ३ कारः अत्र न प्राप्नोति 
If अरवतः is read, the pluta in होतृ३कारः which is the result of the combination होतृ and ऋकारः will not take place. 
गुरोरवतो हस्वस्य इति वक्ष्यामि 
Then shall I read गुरोररवतो ह्रस्वस्य. 
स एष सूत्रभेदेन ऌकारोपदेशः प्लुत्याद्यर्थः सन् प्रत्याख्यायते, सैषा महतो वंशस्तम्बात् लट्वानुकृप्यते 

[[5]]

This tree which is for the sake of pluti is rejected by taking recourse to the remodelling of the sutra this is like taking hold of a small bird called bamboo-bush. 
: from 
From the last sentence it is clear that the Mahabhaṣyakara favours the view that the upadesa of r is necessary and that the flow of words is fourfold. Some think that this is a sort of satirical utterence of Mahabhaṣykara against Värttika- kāra. From the preface it may be learnt that it is not so, but it is only a fact stated in a humorous fashion. 
एआङ्, ऐऔच. 
There are only three topics that are dealt with here:-(1) whether the purpose is served by reading the sutras as q, and ऐऔच् or whether they have to be read as पत् ओत् ₹ and पेत् औत् च् (2) whether the word दीर्घ is to be read in sutrus which enjoin as ēkādēsa and (3) whether such sounds as form part of diphthongs, long vowels, r and !, and as are similar to others are to be taken as their limbs or not. 
I 
इदं विचार्यते इमानि सन्ध्यक्षराणि तपराणि वा उपदिश्येरन् एत् ओत् ङ्, ऐत् औत् च् इति, अतपराणि वा यथान्यासम् इति 
This is discussed whether these diphthongs have to be read with तू following each as पत् ओत् ङ्, ऐत् औत् च् or without 
as they are now. 
कश्चात्र विशेषः ? 
What is here the difference? 
116 
PRATYĀHĀRĀHNIKA- एलोड् ऐच् 
सन्ध्यक्षरेषु तपरोपदेशश्चेत् तपरोच्चारणम् 
Need for reading at the end if the diphthongs have to be followed by त्. 
सन्ध्यक्षरेषु तपरोपदेशश्चेत् तंपरोच्चारणं कर्तव्यम् 
If the diphthongs have to be followed by a, a has to be read at the end. 
प्लुत्यादिष्वज्विधिः 
Rules relating to (will not apply) to pluta and others. 
प्लुत्यादिषु अजाश्रयो विधिर्न सिध्यति, गो३त्रात नौश्त्रात इत्यत्र अनचि च इति अच उत्तरस्य यरो द्वे भवत इति द्विर्वचनं न प्राप्नोति, इह च प्रत्यङ्डे३तिकायन उदङ्कौ ३५गव इति अचि इति ङमुडागमो न प्राप्नोति 
त् 
In the case of pluta and others the rules relating to a will not operate. For instance the doubling of in and 
गोरेत्रात नौरत्रात by the application of the rule अंनचि च cannot take place; so also the doubling of ङ् in प्रत्यङ्ङ्के ३तिकायन and उदड्डौ ३पगव cannot take place since should be followed by an . 
प्लुतसंज्ञा च 
Even the symbol प्लुत. 
प्लुतसंज्ञा च न सिध्यति, ऐ३तिकायन, औ३पगव, उकालोऽज्झस्वदीर्घप्लुतः इति प्लुतसंज्ञा न प्राप्नोति 
Even the symbol pluta cannot operate. For instance in ऐशतिकायन and औ३पगव, पै३ and और cannot get the designation 
⚫ The reason is that and are not comprehended by the pratyāhāra अच्. 

[[7]]

pluta since plutasamjña is enjoined only to an in the sutra उकालोऽज्झस्वदीर्घप्लुतः. 
सन्तु तर्हि अतपराणि 
If so, let them be not followed by तू. 
अतपर एच इग्घ्रस्वादेशे 
If they are not followed by, there is the need for the sutra एच इस्वादेशे. 
यद्यतपराणि एच इस्वादेशे इति वक्तव्यम् 
If they are not तपर, the siitra एच इास्वादेशे has to be read. 
किं प्रयोजनम् ? Why ? 
एचो ह्रस्वादेशशासनेष्वर्ध एकारोऽर्ध ओकारो वा मा भूत् इति 
So that half e' and 'half o' may not be used when the rules relating to the shortening of long vowels operate. 
ननु च यस्यापि तपराणि तेनाप्येतद्वक्तव्यम्; इमावैचौ समाहारवर्णो मात्रा- वर्णस्य मात्रेवर्णोवर्णयोः । तयोर्हस्वादेशशासनेषु कदाचिदवर्णः स्यात् कदाचिदिवर्णोवर्णी, मा कदाचित् अवर्ण भूत् इति 
Oh! this has to be read even when one reads the diphthongs with at the end. The two letters which come under the pratyahara are diphthongs having one matrā for a and another matra for i or u. Hence when rules relating to shortening operate, sometimes a may be substituted and sometimes i or a. They have to avoid the substitution of a. 
118 
PRATYĀHĀRĀHNIKA- एओ, ऐऑच् 
प्रत्याख्यायत एतत् ऐचोचोत्तरभूयस्त्वात् इति 
This will be set aside by the vārttika ऐचोश्चोत्तरभूयस्त्वात् * 
यदि प्रत्याख्यानपक्षः, इदमपि प्रत्याख्यायते सिद्धमेङः सस्थानत्वात् इति 
If the view that it may be rejected is held, this too is rejected by the vārttika सिद्धमेङः सस्थानत्वात् 
ननु चैङः संस्थानतरावर्ध एकारोऽर्ध. ओकारच ! 
Is it not that half e' and 'half o' have their organ of articu- lation closer to that of 7 and ō than i and u? 
न तौ स्तः, यदि हि तौ स्यातां तावेवायमुपदिशेत् 
They two do not exist. If they were to exist, he would have read them alone. 
ननु च भोः छन्दोगानां सात्यमुत्रिराणायनीया अर्धमेकारमर्धमोकारं चाधीयते- सुजाते ए अश्वसूनृते, अध्वर्यो ओ अद्रिभिः सुतम्, शुक्रं ते ए अन्यत्, यजतं ते ए अन्यत् इति 
Oh Sir, those who belong to सात्यमुग्रिशाखा and राणायनीयशाखा among Sāmavidins read half e' and half o viz. सुजाते से अश्व सुनुते, अध्वर्यो ओ अद्विभिः सुतम्, शुक्रं ते ए अन्यत्, यजतं ते ए अन्यत् 
This varttika means this:-when ai or du is shortened, only i and u will be substituted since only those two elements predominate in them. 
† This means thus:-The desired object is achieved since 2 and 6 have the same organ of articulation as i and a and hence if they are shortened, only i and u will take their place. 

[[9]]

पार्षद कृतिरेषा तत्रभवताम् । नैव हि लोके नान्यस्मिन् वेदेऽर्ध एकारोऽर्ध ओकारो वास्ति 
It is the work of a class of revered people. Neither in ordinary usage nor in any other veda do we find half e' or 'half o'. 
From this it is evident that there are three defects if the siitras एओ and ऐऔच are read with तू at their end and there is no defect if they are read as एओङ् and ऐऔच in both the cases, whether the sutra एच इग्घ्रस्वादेशे is pratyākhyāta 
or not, 
There are tiro points of view regarding the organ of articulation and three points of view regarding the composition of and 3. 
Katyayana Pratiśakhya and Taittiriya Prätisakhya take to be a 
palatal vowel like and a labial vowel like 3.

एकारे च (ibid. IT 93) ओष्टोपसंहार उबर्णे (ibid. II 24.) 
ओकारे च, ओष्ठौ तूपसंहृततरी (ibid, II. 13 & 14.) 
Katyayana seems to favour this view. 
Cf. the rürttika - एड:सस्थानत्वात्. 
But Paniniya siksa takes and 3 as gutturo-palatal vowel and guttura-labial vowel respectively. 
OJ. ए ऐ तु, कण्ठतालव्या ओ औ कण्ठोष्ठजी स्वतौ

As regards and at some consider that the a element is one maträ and i or element is also one mätrā.

एकादेशे दीर्घग्रहणम्

II 
Mention of the word दीर्घः in एकादेश. 
एकादेशे दीर्घग्रहणं कर्तव्यम्, आद्गुणो दीर्घः, वृद्धिरेचि दीर्घ इति 
In the sutras enjoining the substitution of one letter for two, the word दीर्घ should be mentioned as आद्गुणो दीर्घः, वृद्धिरेचि दीर्घः 
किं प्रयोजनम् ? Why ? 
आन्तर्यतस्त्रिमात्रचतुर्मात्राणां स्थानिनां त्रिमात्रचतुर्मात्रा आदेशा मा भूवन्निति, खट्वा+इन्द्रः= खट्वेन्द्रः, खट्वा + उदकम् = खट्वोदकम्, खट्वा + ईषा - खट्वेषा, खट्वा+ ऊढा=खट्वोढा, खट्वा+एलका= खट्वैलका, खट्वा+ओदनः-खट्वौदनः, खट्वा+ ऐतिकायनः=खट्वैतिकायनः, खट्वा+औपगवः = खट्वौपगवः इति 
The sūtra ऐकारौकारयोः कण्ट्या पूर्वा मात्रां ताल्वोष्ठयोरुत्तरा (का. प्रा. 1, 73) seems to mean that in and it is one matra and or is one matră. But the commentator has commented upon it in different ways. Some consider that the a element is 1f mātrās and i or u element is half a mātrā. 
Cf. अध्यर्धमात्रा अवर्णस्य अर्धमात्रा इवर्णोवर्णयोः [M. B. under प्लुतावैच इदुतौ (VIII. 2-106.)] 
Philologists favour this view since and aft are represented by the symbols ai and an. That this should have been the original pronunciation. is seen by the fact that they change to ay and av in sandhi. The modern pronunciation with a having one matra andi or u also having one maträ may have been due to the influence of Dravidian Languages. 
Cf. Akara ikara m-aikara m-akum. (Tolkäppiyam I. 54.) 
Akara ukara m-aukära m-akum (ibid. I. 55.) 
Dr. A. A. MacDonell says that and were pronounced as ai and u even at the time of Pratisākhyās (M. V.G. 15-4.) But the Prāti- sakhyas which have been published till now do not seem to express this definitely. 
According to the second view favoured by Katyayana the sutra. एच इग्घ्रस्वादेशे is unnecessary.

Adesas of three and four matras may not, by the principle of similarity, replace sthänin with three or four matras in the following :- खवा+इन्द्रः 
तत्तर्हि दीर्घग्रहणं कर्तव्यम् 
... 
खट्वौपगवः 
Then the word should be read. 
न कर्तव्यम् । उपरिष्टाद् योगविभाग करिष्यते-अकः सवर्णे, एको भवति, ततो दीर्घः, दीर्घश्च स भवति यः स एकः पूर्वपरयोरित्येवं निर्दिष्ट इति 
It need not be read; for the sītra अकः सवर्णे दीर्घः which comes later on is split into two sfitras अकः सवर्णे and दीर्घः. The former means that when ak is followed by a like letter, it is replaced by one letter; and the latter means that the letter which has replaced two letters is the long letter. 
इहापि तर्हि प्राप्नोति, पशुम् विद्धम् पचन्ति इति 
If so, the same will happen in the words पशुम्, विद्धम् and पचन्ति. 
नैष दोषः ; इह तावत्पशुमिति — अम्येकः इतीयता सिद्धम्, सोऽयमेवं सिद्धे सति यत्पूर्वग्रहणं करोति तस्यैतत्प्रयोजनं यथा जातीयकः पूर्वस्तथाजातीयक उभयो- यथा स्यात् इति; विद्धमिति पूर्व इत्येवानुवर्तते अथवा आचार्यप्रवृत्तिर्ज्ञापयति नानेन संप्रसारणस्य दीर्घो भवतीति, यदयं हल उत्तरस्य संप्रसारणस्य दीर्घत्वं शास्ति; पचन्ति इति — अतो गुणे पर इतीयता सिद्धम्, सोऽयमेवं सिद्धे सति यद्रूपग्रहणं करोति तस्यैतत्प्रयोजनं यथाजातीयकं परस्य रूपं तथाजातीयकमुभयोर्यथा स्यात् इति 
No, here is no harm First we shall take पशुम् the result will be achieved by reading the sītra अमि पूर्वः (61–107) as अमि एकः That being so, the Sūtrakāra has read the word पूर्व:, which suggests that the ādāsa of both the letters will be of the same type as the former of the two. We shall then take विद्धम् – The word पूर्व is taken here [in the sutra संप्रसारणाच्च 
122 
PRATYĀHĀRĀHNIKA- एओ, ऐऔच् 
(6-1-108)]. Or the mention of the sutra: (6-4-2) by the Sutrakāra enjoining the lengthening of the samprasarana after a consonant suggests that the lengthening does not operate upon the samprasarana resulting from this sutra. Then shall we take पचन्ति The object is achieved by taking in the siūtra अतो गुणे (6-1-97 ) the word पर alone. When such is the case, the word पररूपम् is taken here [from the siūtra एडि पररूपम् (6-1-94)] which suggests that the adesa of both the letters will be of the same type as the latter of the two. 
इह तर्हि खट्वय माल इति दीर्घवचनादकारो न, अनान्तर्यादेकारौ- कारौ न 
Here then in खवर्ण्यः (खवा+ऋश्यः), मालर्यः (माला+ऋश्यः), a cannot be the adesa since it has been said that a long letter should come there and and ō cannot be the adesa since 
they are not similar. 
तत्र को दोष: ? 
What will be the harm there? 
विगृहीतस्य श्रवणं प्रसज्येत 
There will be the possibility for the absence of sandhi. 
न ब्रूमो वयं यत्र क्रियमाणे दोषः तत्र कर्तव्यम् इति 
We do not say that we shall take recourse to it where we meet with difficulty. 
किं तर्हि ? What then ? 
यत्र क्रियमाणे न दोषः तत्र कर्तव्यम् इति 
We should take recourse to it where we meet with no difficulty by it. 

[[3]]

क्व च क्रियमाणे न दोषः ? 
Where do we not meet with difficulty by taking recourse to it? 
संज्ञाविधौ, वृद्धिरादैच् दीर्घः, अदेङ् गुणो दीर्घः इति 
In sañjñāvidhi like वृद्धिरादैच् दीर्घः, अदेङ् गुणो दीर्घः 
तत्तर्हि दीर्घग्रहणं कर्तव्यम् 
Then the word at should be read, 
न कर्तव्यम् 
No, it need not. 
भवन्ति 
कस्मादेव आन्तर्यतः त्रिमात्रचतुर्मात्राणां स्थानिनां त्रिमात्रचतुर्मात्रा आदेशा न 
How will not the adesas of three or four matras replace the sthanin with three or four matras by adopting the principle of similarity ? 
तपरे गुणवृद्धी 
The guna and vṛddhi letters are associated with a 
ननु च तः परः यस्मात्सोऽयं तपरः ? 
Is not are a bahuvrihi compound? 
नेत्याह, तादपि परस्तपर इति 
No, says he. It is also a tatpurusa compound. 
यदि तादपि परस्तपरः, ऋदोरप् इतीहैव स्यात् यवः, स्तवः ; लवः, पवः 
इत्यत्र न स्यात् 
124 
PRATYĀHĀRĀHNIKA – एओ, ऐऔच् 
If it is taken as a talpuruşa compound, the sutra aq will operate only with respect to यवः and स्तवः and not with respect to लवः and पवः 
नैष तकारः 
This is not takāra. 
कस्तर्हि ? 
What then ? 
दकार: Dakāra. 
किं दकारे प्रयोजनम् ? 
What is the use of reading दकार ? 
अथ किं तकारे ? यद्यसन्देहार्थस्तकारः दकारोऽपि, अथ मुखसुखार्थस्तकारः -दकारोऽपि इति 
What is the use of reading takara? If it is to avoid doubt, dakara also serves the same purpose; if it is for euphony, dakara also is for the same. 
Π 
इदं विचार्यते – य एतेषु वर्णेषु वर्णैकदेशा वर्णान्तरसमानाकृतय एतेषामवयव- ग्रहणेन ग्रहणं स्याद्वा न वा इति 
This is discussed whether in these letters (आ, ई, ऊ, ऋ, ल, ए, ऐ, 
and a) their parts which resemble other letters operate like the latter (in sandhi etc.) or not. 
कुतः पुनरियं विचारणा ? 
Wherefrom does this discussion arise? 

[[5]]

इह हि समुदाया अप्युपदिश्यन्ते अवयवा अपि । अभ्यन्तरश्च समुदायेऽवयवः, तद्यथा-वृक्षः प्रचलन् सहावयवैः प्रचलति ; तत्र समुदायस्थावयवस्य अवयवग्रहणेन ग्रहणं स्याद्वा न वेति जायते विचारणा । 
Here (in the MāhiSvara sutras) are read both wholes (like ऐ, औ, ॠ, etc.) and parts (like अ, इ, र्, etc) Part is evidently within the whole. viz. A tree, when it moves, moves with its parts. Now the need for the discussion whether the parts of the whole operate or not like those which they resemble, arises. 
कश्चात्र विशेषः ? 
What is the difference here? 
वर्णैकदेशा वर्णग्रहणेन चेत् सन्ध्यक्षरे समानाक्षराश्रयो विधिः प्राप्नोति, स प्रति- पेध्यः-अग्ने+इन्द्र, बायो+उदकम् अकः सवर्णे दीर्घ इति दीर्घत्वं प्राप्नोति 
If the parts of letters operate like those which they resemble, the rules relating to a, a, i, 7, u, u, will operate with diphthongs. For example in the sandhi of अने+इन्द्र and वायो+उदकम्, the sutra अकः सवर्णे दीर्घः will operate, 
दीर्घे ह्रस्वविधिप्रतिषेधः 
Prohibition of rules relating to short letters with long ones. 
दीर्घे ह्रस्वाश्रयो विधिः प्राप्नोति, स प्रतिषेध्यः- आलूय, प्रलय, ह्रस्वस्य पिति 
भवतीति तुक् प्राप्नोति 
कृति तुक् 
Rules relating to short letters will have chance to operate with reference to the corresponding long ones and it is to be prohi- bited. For example in the words and the sutra हस्वस्य पिति कृति तुक् will chance to operate and 
तुक् will appear there. 
126 
PRATYĀHĀRĀHNIKA – एओङ्, ऐऔच् 
नैष दोषः, आचार्यप्रवृत्तिर्ज्ञापयति न दीर्घे ह्रस्वाश्रयो विधिर्भवतीति यदयं दीर्घा- च्छे तुकं शास्ति 
It is no harm, for the acarya's procedure suggests that the long letters are not to be affected by the rules relating to short ones since he reads the sutra दीर्घात् which enjoins तुक् after a long letter. 
नैतदस्ति ज्ञापकम् अस्ति ह्यन्यदेतस्य वचने प्रयोजनम् 
This is not a jnapaka, for there is another use of this sutra. 
किम् ? What ? 
पदान्ताद्वा इति विभाषां वक्ष्यामि इति 
To introduce the reader to his sūtra पदान्ताद्वा where he enjoins the optional use of तुक्. 
यत्तर्हि योगविभागं करोति, इतरथा हि दीर्घात्पदान्ताद्वा इत्येव ब्रूयात् 
Since he has read them as two sutras, (we have to take the former to be a jñāpaka); for, otherwise he would have read दीर्घात्पदान्ताद्वा as one sūtra. 
इह तर्हि खट्वाभिः, मालाभिः, अतो भिस ऐस इत्यैस्भावः प्राप्नोति 
If so, in the words खवाभि: and मालाभि:, the case-suffix āis will come on the operation of the sītra अतो भिस पेस् . 
तपरकरणसामर्थ्यान्न भविष्यति 
It does not come on account of तपरकरण. 
तर्हि याता वाता. अतो लोप आर्धधातुके इत्यकारलोपः प्राप्नोति 
If so, in the words याता and वाता, the elision of अकार will take place on the operation of the sutra अतो लोप आर्धधातुके. 

[[7]]

ननु चात्रापि तपरकरणसामर्थ्यादेव न भविष्यति 
Oh! even here it does not come on account of aor itself. 
अस्ति ह्यन्यत्तपरकरणे प्रयोजनम् 
No. for there is another benefit accruing from तपरकरण.. 
किम् ? What ? 
सर्वस्य लोपो मा भूदिति 
So that the elision of the whole may not take place. 
अथ क्रियमाणेऽपि तपरे परस्य लोपे कृते पूर्वस्य कस्मान्न भवति ? 
Even if there is तपस्करण, why is not the preceding letter dropped after the elision of the succeeding letter? 
परलोपस्य स्थानिवद्भावादसिद्धत्वाच 
On account of the स्थानिवद्भाव of the elision of the succeeding element and its being असिद्ध. 
एवं तहिं आचार्यप्रवृत्तिर्ज्ञापयति न आकारस्थस्याकारस्य लोपो भवतीति यद- यम् आतोऽनुपसर्गे कः इति ककारमनुबन्धं करोति 
If so, acarya's procedure suggests that a in a is not elided since he reads the anubandha क् in the sītra आतोऽनुपसर्गे कः 
कथं कृत्वा ज्ञापकम् 
In what manner should it be understood so that it may be taken as a jñāpaka ?

128 
PRATYĀHĀRĀHNIKA – एओक्, ऐऑच् 
This is the benefit of fer that the elision of a may take place on account of the mention of fafa. If the a in a can be elided, for will be of no use when the succeeding a is elided, and when there is q with respect to the two a's the forms गोद्रः and कम्बलद: are formed. The ācārya sees that a in a is not elided and hence uses the anubandha . 
नैतदस्ति ज्ञापकम् । उत्तरार्थमेतत् स्यात् तुन्दशोकयोः परिमृजापनुदोः इति 
This is not a jnapaka. This is for the sake of the following sītra तुन्दशोकयोः परिमृजापनुदोः . 
यत्तर्हि गापोष्टक् इत्यनन्यार्थे ककारमनुबन्धं करोति 
If so, he reads the are with the anubandha in the sutra. गापोष्टक् which serves no other purpose. 
एकवर्णवच्च 
As one letter too. 
एकवर्णवच्च दीर्घो भवतीति वक्तव्यम् 
It should also be said that long letter is taken as one letter.

So that the suffix than which takes place after a dissyllable by the siitra नौह्यचष्ठन् may not appear in the word वाचिक which means वाचा तरति and so that यत् which comes after & dissyllable by the sutra गो द्यचः . 
in the sense of निमित्त of संयोग or उत्पात which is taken there from the sutra तस्य निमित्तं संयोगोत्पातौ may not come after the word वाच् when the meaning वाचो निमित्तम् has to be conveyed.

Even here the mention of the two words

that the sutras dealing with dissylables do not operate in a long vowel. 
अयं तु सर्वेषामेव परिहार: 
This will serve as an answer to meet all the points raised against. 
नाव्यपवृक्तस्यावयवस्य तद्विधिर्यथा द्रव्येषु 
Their rules do not operate in the case of those which resem- ble them and form part of other letters but are not taken cognisance of as separate from the whole, as in dravyas. 
नाव्यपवृक्तस्यावयवस्य अवयवाश्रयो विधिर्भवति यथा द्रव्येषु । तद्यथा— द्रव्येषु सप्तदश सामिधेन्यो भवन्तीति न सप्तदशारनिमात्रं काष्ठमनादभ्याधीयते 
The rules of those letters do not operate in the case of those which resemble them and form part of other letters, but are not taken cognisance of as such, as in dravyas. For instance in the case of dravyas, the purpose of the rule सप्तदश सामिधेन्यो भवन्ति is not satisfied when a wood seventeen cubits long is thrown on fire. 
विषम उपन्यासः, प्रत्यृचं चैव हि तत्कर्म चोद्यते, असम्भवश्चाग्नौ वेद्यां च 
The argument is not sound. The karma is enjoined with reference to every rk and it is impossible either for the fire or for the altar to hold it. 
यथा तर्हि सप्तदश प्रादेशमात्रीराश्वत्थीः समिधो ऽम्यादधीत इति न सप्तदशप्रादेश- मात्रं काष्ठमनावभ्याधीयते 
If so, the purpose of the rule सप्तदश प्रादेशमात्रीराश्वत्थीः समिधोऽ भ्यादधीत is not satisfied when a wood seventeen spans long is thrown into the fire.

If so, as, when it is said that oil should not be sold and that meat should not be sold, they are not sold when they are sepa- rated from the whole, but the cows and mustard wherein they are not separated are sold, and as, when it is said that one should purify himself on touching hair and nail, it is obligatory to do it on touching them when they are separated from the body and it does not matter whether one touches them or not when they are not separated from the body, (so is here also).

If वर्णैकदेशs are not considered to be those which they resem- ble, the letter ? should be read after the sitras enjoining नुद, लादेश and णत्व. After the sutra तस्मान्नुइ द्विहलः, ऋकारे च should be read, so that the forms आनृधतुः and आनृधुः may be got. By him who holds the वर्णैकदेशग्रहणपक्ष, it is achieved by the word fage: itself.

PRATYĀHĀRĀHNIKA - हयवरद् 
will take place by the sutra अनचि च (since रेफ is included under the pratyāhāra यर्.) As regards the likening to the follow- ing letter, in cases like कुण्डं रथेन, वनं रथेन, the sūtra अनुस्वारस्य ययि परसवर्णः will operate so that परसवर्ण will take place.

PRATYĀHĀRAHNIKA- हयवरद 
in द्विर्वचन, रेफ and हकार are not the recipients of द्विर्वचन. What then? They are निमित्तs of द्विर्वचन. It is analogous to this-when it is said that brahmins may be fed and and may serve, they two do not dine then.

Since they being heard without being read are operated upon without being included in any pratyāhāra. 
* It is interesting to note that Kannada grammarians began to use the term yogavaha in place of ayōgdväha; this is perhaps due to false etymology that those letters are found only in the company of others or metanalysis.)

अविशेषेण संयोगोपधासंज्ञालोऽन्त्यद्विर्वचनस्थानिवद्भावप्रतिषेधाः 
Reading wherever necessary for the sake of the संज्ञा, संयोग and उपधा, for the operation of अलोऽन्त्यविधि and द्विर्वचनविधि and for the prohibition of स्थानिवद्भाव. 
● 
अविशेषेण संयोगसंज्ञा प्रयोजनम् ३३०जक हलोऽनन्तराः संयोगः इति संयोगसंज्ञा, संयोगे गुरु इति गुरुसंज्ञा, गुरोः इति प्लुतो भवति । उपधा- संज्ञा च प्रयोजनम् — दुष्कृतम्, निष्कृतम्, दुष्पीतम्, निष्पीतम्, इदुदुपधस्य चाप्रत्यययस्य इति षत्वं सिद्धं भवति 
By reading it wherever necessary, संयोगसंज्ञा is one prayojana. In उ३जक, the letter उ is pluta संयोगसंज्ञा and गुरुसंज्ञा are got by the operation of the sitras हलोऽनन्तराः संयोगः and संयोगे गुरु and it becomes pluta after being operated upon by the sutra गुरोः उपधासंज्ञा also is another prayojana. The षत्व is achieved in दुष्कृतम्, निष्कृतम्, दुप्पीतम् and निष्पतिम् by the opera- tion of the siitra इदुदुपधस्य चाप्रत्ययस्य. 
... 
नैतदस्ति प्रयोजनम् ; न इदुदुपधग्रहणेन विसर्जनीयो विशेष्यते 
This is not a prayojana, for the penultimate and उ do not qualify the visarga. 
किं तर्हि ? What then ? 
सकारो, विशेष्यते, इदुदुपधस्य सकारस्य यो विसर्जनीय इति 
सकार is qualified thus—the visarga which has replaced सकार in the word having for the penultimate इत् and उत्. 
अथवा उपधाग्रहणं न करिष्यते । इदुद्भ्यां तु परं विसर्जनीयं विशेषयिष्यामः इदुद्भ्यामुत्तरस्य विसर्जनीयस्य इति 

[[7]]

Or उपधा is not read there. 
We shall qualify the visarga 
as followed by इत् and उत् thus - इदुद्भयामुत्तरस्य विसर्जनीयस्य. 
अलोऽन्त्यविधिश्च प्रयोजनम् — वृक्षस्तरति, लक्षस्तरति - अलोऽन्त्यस्य विधयो 
भवन्तीति अलोऽन्त्यस्य सत्वं सिद्धं भवति 
The operation of अलोऽन्त्यविधि also is a prayojana. In the examples वृक्षस्तरति and लक्षस्तरति सकार takes the place of visarga by taking recourse to the rule अलोऽन्त्यस्य विधयो भवन्ति. 
एतदपि नास्ति प्रयोजनम् । निर्दिश्यमानस्य आदेशा भवन्ति इति विसर्जनीय- स्यैव भविष्यति 
This too is not a prayojana. Since adesas replace only what is mentioned; a replaces only the visarga. 
द्विर्वचनं प्रयोजनम् — उरः कः, उरःपः - अनचि च अच उत्तरस्य यरो द्वे भवत इति द्विर्वचनं सिद्धं भवति 
Doubling is another benefit. In the examples :: and उरःपः doubling is achieved by the operation of the sutra अनचि च which means that यर् following a vowel is doubled. 
स्थानिवद्भावप्रतिषेधश्च प्रयोजनम्, यथेह भवति उरः केण, उर:पेण, इति अड्- व्यवाय इति णत्वम् एवमिहापि स्थानिवद्भावात्प्राप्नोति, व्यूढोरस्केन महोरस्केन इति ; तत्र अनल्विधौ इति प्रतिषेधः सिद्धो भवति 
स्थानिवद्भावप्रतिषेध also is a prayojana; just as णत्व may come by अव्यवाय in उरः केण and उरः पेण, so also the णत्व may come by स्थानिवद्भाव in व्यूढोरस्केन and महोरस्केन and it is prevented by अनल्विधौ.

PRATYĀHĀRĀHNIKA-हयवरद् 
अर्थवन्तो वर्णाः धातुप्रातिपदिकप्रत्ययनिपातानाम् एकवर्णानामर्थदर्शनात् 
Letters have meaning, since there is meaning in one-lettered roots, stems, affixes and nipātus.

Letters have meaning. Why ? Since meaning is found in one- lettered roots, stems, affixes and nipātas. One lettered roots having meaning are found. viz. पति, अध्येति, अधीते. One-lettered stems having meaning are found. viz. आभ्याम् एभिः, एषु। One- lettered affixes having meaning are found. viz. औपगवः, कापटवः. One-lettered nipātas having meaning are found. viz. अ अपेहि, इ इन्द्रं पश्य, उ उत्तिष्ठ, अ अपक्राम. We think that letters have meaning since one-lettered roots, stems, affixes and nipatas are found to have meaning. 
वर्णव्यत्यये चार्थान्तरगमनात् 
On account of change in meaning by the change in letters. वर्णव्यत्यये च अर्थान्तरगमनान्मन्यामहे अर्थवन्तो वर्णा इति कूपः सूपो यूप इति — कूप इति सककारेण कश्चिदर्थो गम्यते, सूप इति ककारापाये सकारापजने चार्था- न्तरं गम्यते, यूप इति ककारसकारापाये यकारोपजनेऽर्थान्तरं गम्यते । तेन मन्यामहे यः कूपे कूपार्थः स ककारस्य $ यः सूपे सूपार्थः स सकारस्य, यो यूपे यूपार्थः स यका- रस्य इति 
Root इण्. + Root क्. 
+ Root इब्. 
$ अन्येषां ग्रन्थाः सककारस्येति; त एवमाहुः सह ककारेण अर्थवत्ता इति (Pradipika) 

[[9]]

We think that letters have meaning since meaning changes in words if one letter is replaced by another. viz. कृपः सूपः, यूपः. The word is seen to have one meaning when it is with ककार; another meaning is seen in the word सूपः where कृ is removed and is placed in its stead; and another meaning is seen in the word : where both and are removed and 
क् is placed instead. Therefore we think that the meaning of the word कूप is in its ककार, that of सूप is in its सकार and that of ग्रुप is in its पंकार. 
सू 
वर्णानुपलब्धौ चानर्थगतेः 
स् 
On account of the absence of that meaning in the absence of one letter. 
वर्णानुपलब्धौ चानर्थगतेर्मन्यामहे अर्थवन्तो वर्णा इति-वृक्षः, ऋक्षः काण्डीरः, आण्डीरः - वृक्ष इति सवकारेण कश्चिदर्थो गम्यते, ऋक्ष इति वकारापाये सोऽर्थो न गम्यते । काण्डीर इति सककारेण कश्चिदर्थो गम्यते, आण्डीर इति ककारापाये सोऽर्थो न गम्यते 
We think that letters have meaning since, in the absence of one letter, that meaning is not found. viz. वृक्षः, ऋक्षःः काण्डीरः, आण्डीरः. The word वृक्ष is found to have a meaning when it is with the letter and when that letter is removed, the same meaning is not found in the word. The word काण्डीरः is found to have a meaning when it is with the letter and when that letter is removed, the same meaning is not found in the word आण्डीर:. 
किं तर्ह्यच्यते अनर्थगतेः इति, न साधीयो यत्रार्थस्य गतिर्भवति ? 
Why is it said अनर्थगतेः ? Is not its meaning well understood ? 
एवं तर्हि इदं पठितव्यं स्यात् वर्णानुपलब्धौ चातदर्थगतेः इति

The word अतदर्थगतेः is taken to be the ablative case of अतदर्थगतिः which is the compound of न and तदर्थगतिः तदर्थगतिः is taken to be the tatpurusa compound of तदर्थ and गतिः, where तदर्थ is the compound of तस्य and अर्थ:. Or अतदर्थगतेः is taken to be the ablative case of अतदर्थगतिः which is the compound of न and तदर्थगतिः तदर्थगतिः is taken to be the tatpurusa compound of तदर्थ and गतिः, where तदर्थ is the compound of सः and अर्थः 
स तर्हि तथा निर्देशः कर्तव्यः 
Then it should be read so. 
न कर्तव्यः ; उत्तरपदलोपोऽत्र द्रष्टव्यः तद्यथा उष्ट्रमुखमिव मुखम् अस्य उष्ट्रमुखः, खरमुखः । एवम् अतदर्थगतेः अनर्थगतेः इति 
No, it need not be read. Here it is to be construed that the following word has been dropped. Just as in the word उष्ट्र्मुखः whose विग्रहवाक्य is उष्ट्र मुखमिव मुखम् अस्य the word मुखम् after उष्टू is dropped and also in खरमुखः, so also in the word अनर्थगतेः the word a after a is dropped *. 
संघातार्थवत्वाच्च 
On account of the collection having meaning. 
* नू between अ and अर्थगतेः should be taken as intervocalic.

We think that letters have meaning since their collection has meaning. If the collections of letters have meaning, their parts too, have meaning. If the parts have meaning, their wholes also have meaning. viz. If one man with eyes is able to see, a collec- tion of hundred such men is able to see. If one gingelly seed is capable of giving oil, 64 marakkal of gingelly seed is capable of giving oil. If the parts have no meaning, their wholes also cannot have meaning, viz. If one blind man is not able to see, a collection of hundred such men cannot see; if one particle of sand cannot give oil, hundred khari of the same cannot give oil. 
यदि तर्हि इमे वर्णा अर्थवन्तः अर्थवत्कृतानि प्राप्नुवन्ति

Collection having one meaning, absence of case-suffixes after letters. 
संघातस्य एकत्वमर्थ, तेन वर्णात्सुबुत्पत्तिर्न भविष्यति 
Since the collection has one meaning, case-suffixes will not come after each letter. 
अनर्थकास्तु प्रतिवर्णमर्थानुपलब्धेः 
Letters, on the other hand, have no meaning since meaning is not had for every letter. 
अनर्थकास्तु वर्णाः । कुतः ? प्रतिवर्णमर्थानुपलब्धेः । न हि प्रतिवर्णमर्था उप- लभ्यन्ते । किमिदं प्रतिवर्णमिति ? वर्ण वर्ण प्रति प्रतिवर्णम्

We think that letters have no meaning since the same meaning is found though there is metathesis, elision, augment or substi- tution of letters. In metathesis, तर्कः is from कृत्, सिकता is from 
कस् 
and ferg: is from fe; here is metathesis only of letters. and no change in meaning. अपाय means elision— viz. हतः, घ्नन्ति, घ्नन्तु, अघ्नन् Here is elision of letters and not of meaning. Here is only उपजन means augment viz. लविता, लवितुम्. augment of letters and not of meaning. विकार means आदेश viद, घातयति, घातकः. Here is only substitution of letters and not of meaning. As there is metathesis, elision, augment on substitution of letters, so should there be change, elision, augment and substitution in meaning. It is not so here. Hence we think that letters have no meaning.

What about the reasons enunciated by you to comprehend that letters have meaning - अर्थवन्तो वर्णाः.. सङ्घातार्थवस्वाच्च ? The words of the type कूपः, सूपः and यूपः are different letter smaller groups having different meanings. If the change in their meaning is due only to the change of a single letter, the major portion of the meaning of कूप should lie in सूप, that of 
सूप in कूप, that of कूप in that of यूप in कूप, that of सूप in ग्रूप and that of ग्रुप in सूप. Since there is nothing of the meaning of कूप in सूप, that of in कूप, that of कृप in that of ग्रुप 
यूप, 
सूप 
ग्रूप, 
in 
कूप, 
that of 
सूप in यूप and that of चूप in सूप, we think that these are different groups having different meanings. Even this has been very well suggested by you that letters have no meaning while proving that letters have meaning. He who thinks that the meaning of कूप is in ककार, that of सूप in सकार, and that of ग्रुप in यकार, has to decide that ऊप has no meaning.

अनुवर्तते विभाषा शरोऽचि यद्वारयत्ययं द्वित्वम् 
विभाषा follows since he prohibits doubling by the sītra शरोऽचि. यदयं शरोऽचि इति द्विर्वचनप्रतिषेधं शास्ति, तत् ज्ञापयत्याचार्योऽनुवर्तते 
विभाषा इति 
Since he prohibits doubling by the siūtra शरोऽचि, ācārya suggests that विभाषा follows. 
कथं कृत्वा ज्ञापकम् ? 
On what interpertation will it become ज्ञापक ? 
नित्ये हि तस्य लोपे प्रतिषेधार्थो न कश्चित् स्यात् 
If the lopa is nitya, there will be no use of prohibition. 
यदि नित्यो लोपः स्यात् प्रतिषेधवचनमनर्थकं स्यात् । अस्त्वत्र द्विर्वचनं, झरो झरि सवर्णे इति लोपो भविष्यति । पश्यति त्वाचार्यः विभाषा स लोप इति ; ततो द्विर्वचनप्रतिषेधं शास्ति 
If the elision is nitya, the sutra enjoining prohibition will be of no use. Let there be doubling. Elision takes place by the sutra झरो झरि सवर्णे ācārya sees that the elision is optional and so reads the sutra prohibiting doubling. 
नैतदस्ति ज्ञापकम् । नित्येऽपि तस्य लोपे स प्रतिषेधोऽवश्यं वक्तव्यः, यदेतद् अचो रहाभ्यां इति द्विर्वचनं लोपापवादः स विज्ञायते 
No, this is not a ज्ञापक; for the sūtra of prohibition need be mentioned even when the elision is nitya since the doubling enjoined by the siitra अचो रहाभ्याम् is considered to be the अपवाद to the लोप. 
कथम् ! How ? 
162 
PRATYĀHĀRĀHNIKA- लण् 
यर इत्युच्यते, एतावन्तश्च यरः यदुत झरो वा यमो वा । यदि चात्र लोपः 
स्यात् द्विर्वचनमनर्थकं स्यात् 
यरः is said; both झरः and यमः are यरः. If there is elision here, doubling will be of no use. 
किं तर्हि तयोर्योगयोरुदाहरणम् ? 
What then are the examples for those two sutras? 
यदकृते द्विर्वचने त्रिव्यञ्जनः संयोगः-प्रत्तम् अवत्तम् आदित्य्यः । इहेदानीं कर्ता हर्ता इति द्विर्वचनसामर्थ्याल्लोपो न भवति । एवमिहापि लोपो न स्यात् कर्षति वर्षति इति । तस्मान्नित्येऽपि लोपे अवश्यं स प्रतिषेधो वक्तव्यः 
Where, in the absence of doubling, there are three consonants together viz. प्रत्तम् अवत्तम् आदित्ययः. Here now in the examples कर्ता and हर्ता there is no elision on the strength of the enjoining of doubling. So also here in the examples कर्षति and वर्षति there is no elision. Hence even when the elision is nitya, that prohibition should needs be said. 
तदेतदत्यन्तं सन्दिग्धं वर्तते आचार्याणां विभाषा अनुवर्तते न वेति

The elision of one of the two will take place by the sūtra हलो यमां यमि लोपः.

This is the benefit of the mention of धातु that रपरत्व may not happen in मातृणाम् and पितॄणाम् If रपरत्व is here, धातुग्रहण will be of no avail; for after a is brought in, there will be no इत्व since there will be no अन्त्यत्व. Acārya sees that there is no रपरत्व here and hence reads धातु in the sītra. 
इहापि तर्हि इत्वं न प्राप्नोति — चिकीर्षति जिहीर्षति 
If so, there will be no इत्व here also in चिकीर्षति and जिहीर्षति.

If there is mention of them in combination with case-suffix, there are अर्धचतस्रो मात्राः and if, on the other hand, there is mention through प्रत्याहार, there are only तिस्रो मात्रा:.

Then what for is their mention made? 
वर्णज्ञानं वाग्विषयो यत्र च ब्रह्म वर्तते । तदर्थमिष्टबुद्धधर्थं लघ्वर्थं चोपदिश्यते ।। 
This suggests that there was a Vyakarana in the form of sutras before Aşttadhyayi. There are many places where Mahabhaṣyakara makes mention of पूर्वसूत्र Cf. पूर्वसूत्रेषु च येऽनुबन्धाः न तैरिहेत्कार्याणि क्रियन्ते (VII, 1, 18) etc. 
+ यदेवोक्तं वार्त्तिककारेण वृत्तिसमवायार्थ उपदेश इति, तदेव श्लोकवार्त्तिककारोऽप्याह (Pradipika.) From this it is clear that the two verses-- 
अक्षरं न क्षरं विद्यादश्नोतेर्वा सरोऽक्षरम् । वर्ण वाहुः पूर्वसूत्रे किमर्थमुपदिश्यते ॥ 
वर्णज्ञानं वाग्विषयो यंत्र च ब्रह्म वर्तते ।

In this ahnika two sutras, vrddhiradaic and ikōgunavṛddhi are discussed at length. This is called vṛddhyähnika since the first word of the first sutra is vrddhi. 
वृद्धिरादैच् 
Here eight topics are dealt with. They are (1) why was the sūtra not read as वृद्धिरादैक् ? (2) is वृद्धिरादैच् uddāsya or आदैच् alone? (3) need for the adhikarasutra ar at the beginning. (4) is this sutra samjñāvidhayaka or sabdasadhutvädividhayaka? (5) of the two वृद्धिः and आदैच्, which is संज्ञा and which is संशिन् ? (6) अन्योन्याश्रयतावारणम् (7) the need for the word प्रत्येकम् in this sutra and the next and (8) what is the need for a in आत् of आदैच् ? 
कुत्वं 
I 
कस्मान्न भवति, चोः कुः पदस्येति ! # 
Why is not the final 
sanctioned by the sutra 
क् 
of the word and replaced by as is 
: foo9 ? 
That this antra consists of 2 words : and 
is known from 
the word : in the statement of Bhasyakara later on in this sutra कृतमनयोस्साधुत्वम्. That it may be considered to be made up of three words is known from the bhāsya वृद्धिः आत् ऐच् in the first āhnika. When आदैच is one word, it has not taken the form 3 since samasantavidhi is con- sidered to be anitya. 
↑ कुत्वं here does not refer to all the five letters of कवर्ग, but to plone. 
If one thinks that this point does not arise since Panini's sitras are intended for the laukika and vaidika words and ädäic is neither, he should be given this answer:-Since the samjña, vrddhi, which is enjoined here may be considered to be laukika and its relation to samjnin is considered to be nitya, the samjili adaic should also be considered a laukika word. Or it may be considered to be the anukarana of what is found in the pratyāhāra. Those who uphold the theory i aft: should take आदैच् to be jātivācaka. 
176 
VRDDHYĀHNIKA- वृद्धिरादैच् 
भत्वात् 
Because it is taken to be bha (and not pada). 
कथं भसंज्ञा ? 
On what authority is it bha? 
अयस्मयादीनि छन्दसि इति 
By the sutra अयस्मयादीनि छन्दसि. 
छन्दसीत्युच्यते, न चेदं छन्दः 
The word chandasi is found there and this is not chandas. 
छन्दोवत्सूत्राणि भवन्ति * 
Vyakarana sutras are treated like Vedic expressions. 
यदि भसंज्ञा वृद्धिरादैजदेङ्गुण इति जश्त्वमपि न प्राप्नोति 
If it is bha and not pada, it will not change to as is found in वृद्धिरादैजदेङ्गुणः. 
उभयसंज्ञान्यपि छन्दांसि दृश्यन्ते, तद्यथा—स सुष्टुभा स ऋक्व॑ता ग॒णेन॑ (R. V. IV, 50, 5) पदत्वात् कुत्वं भत्वाज्जश्त्वं न भवति; एवमिहापि पदत्वाज्जश्त्वं भत्वात्कुत्वं न भविष्यति 
Vedic expressions are found to have both the samjñas viz. सुष्टुभा स ऋक्वता गणेन, where च् is changed to क् on account of pada-samjna and is not changed to on account of bhasamjna in the word . Similarly here is changed to on account of pada-samjna and it is not changed to on account of bha-sanjna. 
Since Vyakarana is said to be an important limb of Vedas in the first ähnika, it may be treated like Vēdas. The reason for not having read ऐच् 19 ऐकू may be said to be for the sake of clearness. ऐच alone can make the reader understand easily that Panini refers to the pratyahara.

If, on the other hand, there is reference only to à, ài and ãu, the sūtra uttarapadavrddhāu sarvañca's will be applied to the word सर्वभास which is the compound of सर्वो भासः (when the word will have its final syllable udatta), and when areaft भार्या यस्य यावती भार्या यस्य are compounded, there will be no punvadbhāva so that the forms तादद्भार्यः, and यावद्भार्यः cannot be formed, (but they would become तावतीभार्यः and यावतीभार्यः, which forms are not current in the world). 
अस्तु तर्हि आदैज्मात्रस्य ग्रहणम् 
In that case, let the reference be only to a, ai and äu. 
ननु चोक्तं सर्वो भासः सर्वभास इति उत्तरपदवृद्धौ सर्व च इत्येष विधिः प्राप्नोति ! 
Has it not been said that, in that case, the sītra उत्तरपदवृद्धौ ... will apply to सर्वभास which is the compound of सर्वो भासः ? 
नैष दोषः, नैवं विज्ञायते उत्तरपदस्य वृद्धिः उत्तरपदवृद्धिः उत्तरपदवृद्धाविति It is no harm; the word get is not the locative of उत्तरपदवृद्धिः, the compound of उत्तरपदस्य बृद्धिः. 
कथं तर्हि ? How then ? 
उत्तरपदस्य इत्येवं प्रकृत्य या वृद्धिः तद्वत्युत्तरपदे इत्येवमेतद्विज्ञायते । अवश्यं चैतदेवं विज्ञेयम्, तद्भावितग्रहणे सत्यपि इह प्रसज्येत सर्वः कारकः सर्वकारक इति 
It is understood in this way :- उत्तरपदस्य इत्येवं प्रकृत्य या वृद्धिः तद्वत्युत्तरपदे. This should be interpreted this way, for, otherwise, even granting tadbhävitagrahana that defect will appear even in the word सर्वकारकः, the compound of सर्वः कारकः. 
* Bhatuajidiksit's vrtti-उत्तरपदस्येत्यधिकृत्य या वृद्धिर्विहिता तद्वत्युत्तरपदे परे सर्वशब्दो दिक्शब्दाच अन्तोदात्ता भवन्ति; सर्वपाञ्चालकः अधिकारग्रहणं किम् ? सर्वभासः.

यदप्युच्यते इह तावती भार्या यस्य तावद्भार्यः यावद्भार्यः इति च वृद्धिनिमि- त्तस्य इति पुंवद्भावप्रतिषेधः प्राप्नोतीति, नैष दोषः ; नैवं विज्ञायते वृद्धेर्निमित्तं वृद्धिनिमित्तं, वृद्धिनिमित्तस्येति 
.. . 
And the other point that was raised that pumvadbhava- pratisādha will happen by the siūtra 'orddhinimittasya... ' in the case of तावद्भार्यः, the compound of तावती भार्या यस्य and यावद्भार्यः cannot stand, for the word वृद्धिनिमित्तस्य is not taken to be the genitive of वृद्धिनिमित्तम्, the compound of वृद्धेर्निमित्तम् . 
कथं तर्हि ? How then ? 
वृद्धेर्निमित्तं यस्मिन्सोऽयं वृद्धिनिमित्तः वृद्धिनिमित्तस्येति 
It is the genitive of वृद्धिनिमित्त, the compound of वृद्धेर्निमित्तम् यस्मिन् सः. 
किं च वृद्धेर्निमित्तम् ! 
What is the nimitta of vrddhi? 
योऽसौ ककारो, ञकारो णकारो वा 
Kakāra, nakāra or nakāra. 
अथवा यः कृत्स्नायाः वृद्धेर्निमित्तम् 
Or that which is the nimitta of all vṛddhi. 
कश्च कृत्स्नायाः वृद्धेर्निमित्तम् ! 
What is the nimitta of all vrddhi? 
यस्त्रयाणामाकारैकारौकाराणाम् 
That which is (the nimitta) of ā, āi and āu. 
Since there is no varttika in the first two topics, it is clear that they are Mahābhāsyakāra's own.

संज्ञाधिकारः संज्ञासंप्रत्ययार्थः 
Samjñādhikarasutra for clear conception of samjna. 
अथ संज्ञा इत्येवं प्रकृत्य वृद्ध्यादयः शब्दाः पठितव्याः; किं प्रयोजनम् ? संज्ञा- संप्रत्ययार्थः, वृद्ध्यादीनां शब्दानां संज्ञा इत्येष संप्रत्ययो यथा स्यात् 
What 
There should be a sutra a ar before orddhi etc. for? Samjñāsampratyayārthak, so that there may be clear conception that the words like vrddhi are samjñās. 
इतरथा ह्यसंप्रत्ययो यथा लोके 
For otherwise, absence of clear conception, as in the world, 
अक्रियमाणे हि संज्ञाधिकारे वृद्ध्यादीनां संज्ञेत्येष संप्रत्ययो न स्यात् । इदमि- दानीं बहुसूत्रमनर्थकं स्यात् । अनर्थकमित्याह । कथम् । यथा लोके, लोके ह्यर्थवन्ति चानर्थकानि च वाक्यानि दृश्यन्ते । अर्थवन्ति तावत् — देवदत्त गामभ्याज शुक्लां दण्डेन, देवदत्त गामभ्याज कृष्णाम् इति; अनर्थकानि दश दाडिमानि षडपूपाः कुण्डमजाजिनं पललपिण्डः अधरोरुकमेतत्कुमार्याः स्फैयकृतस्य पिता प्रतिशीनः इति 
If samjñādhikara is not done, one cannot have a clear concep- tion of vrddhi etc. to be samjña. Then many chapters may become meaningless. Meaningless, says he; how? As is in the world. There are sentences in the world both with meaning and without meaning: those that have meaning are at first, देवदत्त ... कृष्णाम् ; those that are meaningless are दश. प्रतिशीनः. 
.... 
Note that the word वाक्यानि is used in the sense of groups of 
words whether they make a sense or no.

संज्ञासंज्ञयसंदेहव 
Removal of the doubt of samjna and samjnin. 
क्रियमाणेऽपि संज्ञाधिकारे संज्ञासंज्ञिनोरसन्देहो वक्तव्यः । कुतो ह्येतत् वृद्धि- शब्दः संज्ञा, आदैचः संज्ञिन इति ; न पुनरादैचः संज्ञा, वृद्धिशब्दः संज्ञी इति 
Even when the samjñādhikarasutra is read, doubt should be cleared as to what is samjña and what is samjnin. For how does one know that the word vrddhi is samjña and a, ai and au are samjñins and not a, ai and au are samjñās and vrddhi, samjnin ? 
यत्तावदुच्यते संज्ञाधिकारः कर्तव्यः संज्ञासंप्रत्ययार्थः इति, न कर्तव्यः 
The first point raised that संज्ञाधिकारः कर्तव्यः संज्ञासंप्रत्ययार्थः need not be. 
आचार्याचारात् संज्ञासिद्धिः 
The conception of samjña from Acarya's use. 
आचार्याचारात् संज्ञासिद्धिर्भविष्यति 
One can have a definite conception of what is samjna from Acārya's using them. 
किमिदमाचार्याचारादिति 
What is here the meaning of आचार्याचारात् ? 
आचार्याणामुपचारात् 
By the vyavahara of Acarya. 
यथा लौकिकवैदिकेषु 
As is found in those related to loka and vēda.

I 
It is like the happenings in the world and in the vedas, First in the world the parents name the child that is born as Devadatta, Yajnadatta in a closed room and by their use, others understand that it is his name. In the vedas too yājñikas name sacrificial utensils as sphoya, yūpa, casāla etc. and from the use of those words made by those venerable men, others understand them to be their respective संज्ञा. 
एवमिहापि इहैव तावत् केचिद्व्याचक्षाणा आहुः वृद्धिशब्दः संज्ञा, आदैचः संजिन इति ; अपरे पुनः सिचि वृद्धि:... इत्युक्त्वा आकारैकारौकारानुदाहरन्ति ; तेन मन्यामहे यया प्रत्याय्यन्ते सा संज्ञा, ये प्रतीयन्ते ते संज्ञिन इति 
So also here; Even here some comment that the word vrddhi is samjñā and a, ai and äu are samjnins; others read the sutra सिचि वृद्धिः . and illustrate it with ā, āi and au; thence do we understand that with which another is denoted is samjña and those that are denoted are samjnins.

यदप्युच्यते क्रियमाणेऽपि संज्ञाधिकारे संज्ञासंज्ञिनोरसन्देहो वक्तव्य इति 
As regards the statement क्रियमाणेऽपि

There is no doubt about संज्ञा and संशिन

वक्तव्यः 
चारः 
LECTURES ON PATANJALI'S MAHABHAŞYA 
संज्ञासंज्ञिनोश्च असन्देहः सिद्धः; कुतः ? आचार्याचारादेव, उक्त आचार्या- 
Evidently there is no doubt with regard to संज्ञा and संशिन् . How? From ācārya's ācāra; ācāryācāra has been explained. 
अनाकृतिः 
That which has no akrti. 
अथवा अनाकृतिः संज्ञा, आकृतिमन्तः संजिनः । लोकेऽपि ह्याकृतिमतो मांस- पिण्डस्य देवदत्त इति संज्ञा क्रियते 
Or samjña is that which has no akrti and samjnins are those which have ākrti. Even in the world the name Devadatta is given to the mass of flesh having akrti.* 
Since it is not easy here to decide which is akṛtiman and which is anākrtimān, Vārttikakāra gives another reason thus:-- 
लिङ्गेन वा 
Or with particular distinguishing mark. 
अथवा किंचिल्लिङ्गमासज्य वक्ष्यामि इत्थंलिङ्गा संज्ञेति; वृद्धिशब्दे च तल्लिङ्गं करिष्यते, नादैच्छब्दे 
Or for using a particular distinguishing mark, I shall say that samjna is that which has a particular mark; and that mark is added to vrddhi and not to ādaic. 
इदं तावदयुक्तम्, यदुच्यते आचार्याचारादिति 
The statement ācāryācārāt is inappropriate. 
Akyti though generally means jati here means manyness; hence 
anakrti means oneness.. 
184 
VRDDHYĀHNIKA-वृद्धिरादैच् 
किमत्रायुक्तम् ! 
How is it here inappropriate? 
तमेवोपालभ्य अगमकं ते सूत्रमिति, तस्यैव पुनः प्रमाणीकरणमित्येतदयुक्तम्, अपरितुष्यन् खल्वपि भवाननेन परिहारेण अनाकृतिर्लिङ्गेन वा इत्याह 
Having found fault with him that his sutra is not clear it is inappropriate to take his sutra as the authority. Only not being satisfied with it have you given other reasons anakrtiḥ lingēna vā. 
तच्चापि वक्तव्यम् 
That distinguishing mark will have to be mentioned. 
यद्यप्येतदुच्यते, अथवैतर्हि इत्संज्ञा न वक्तव्या, लोपश्च न वक्तव्यः, संज्ञालिङ्ग- मनुबन्धेषु करिष्यते । न च संज्ञाया निवृत्तिरुच्यते । स्वभावतः संज्ञा संज्ञिनं प्रत्याय्य स्वयं निवर्तते, तेनानुबन्धानामपि निवृत्तिर्भविष्यति 
If it is said, then there is no need for enjoining it-samjna and its elision. The distinguishing mark is attached to anubandhas (found in roots etc.) and no sutra enjoining its disappearance need be said; as the samjña enabling us to understand the samjñin disappears of its own accord, so also the anubandhas disappear. 
सिध्यत्येवम् ; अपाणिनीयं तु भवति यथान्यासमेवास्तु 
The desired object is thus accomplished. But it goes against Panini's plan. Let the sutras remain as they are. 
24 
* संज्ञाः संज्ञिनः प्रत्याय्य निवर्तन्ते in another reading.

ननु चोक्तम् संज्ञाधिकारः संज्ञासंप्रत्ययार्थः इतरथा ह्यसंप्रत्ययो यथा लोके इति 
Has.it not been said that samjñadhikara is for clear conception of samjñā and otherwise there will be no clear conception, as is found in the world? 
न च यथा लोके तथा व्याकरणे । प्रमाणभूत आचार्यो दर्भपवित्रपाणिः शुचाववकाशे प्राङ्मुख उपविश्य महता प्रयत्नेन सुत्त्राणि प्रणयति स्म । तत्राशक्यं वर्णेनाप्यनर्थकेन भवितुं । किं पुनरियता सूत्रेण 
The same is not the case in grammar as is in the world. The Acarya who is an authority for us composed these sutras with great effort, having seated himself in a clean place with face turned east and with a ring made of kusa grass worn on his fourth finger. Not even a single letter there can be found to be meaningless. What about this whole sūtra ? 
किमतः ? What from that ? 
यदशक्यम्, अतः संज्ञासंज्ञिनावेव 
Since it is not possible (even for a letter to be anarthaka), they are samjñā and samjnin. 
IV 
कुतो नु खल्वेतत् संज्ञासंज्ञिनावेवेति, न पुनः साध्वनुशासने अस्मिन् शास्त्रे साधुत्वमनेन क्रियते ? 
How is it that it is decided that they are samjña and samjnin and not that they are decided to be correct from this sastra intended to decide the correctness of words? 
186 
कृतमनयोस्साधुत्वम् 
VRDDHYĀHNIKA-वृद्धिरादैच् 
The correctness of these two* has been ascertained. 
कथम् ? How ? 
वृधिरस्मा अविशेषेणोपदिष्टः प्रकृतिपाठे, तस्मात् क्तिन्प्रत्ययः । आदैचोऽप्यक्षर- समाम्नाये उपदिष्टाः 
The root vrdh is read in prakrtipatha and the pratyaya 'ktin' is suffixed to it. At and aic are read in Mahesvarasutras.† 
प्रयोगनियमार्थं तर्हीींदं स्यात् – वृद्धिशब्दात्परे आदैचः प्रयोक्तव्या इति 
Let then this be to decide the order of words that ādaicaḥ should be used after the word vrddhik. 
नेह प्रयोगनियम आरभ्यते # 
The restriction of the order of words is not commenced 
here. 
किं तर्हि ? What then ? 
संस्कृत्य संस्कृत्य पदान्युत्सृज्यन्ते तेषां यथेष्टमभिसंबन्धो भवति, तद्यथा आहर पात्रम्, पात्रमाहर इति 
Words are formed here. They may be connected in any way one likes, as in ahara patram and patram ahara. 
Two refers to erddhiḥ and adaic. 
†This sentence means that the letters denoted by at and aic are read or comprahended in Mahesvarasatras: अइउण् and ऐऔच् 
This clearly shows that Panini does not deal with syntax but only with Phonology and Morphology. 

[[7]]

आदेशास्तर्हि इमे स्युः, वृद्धिशब्दस्य आदैच आदेशाः 
Then may these be adesas; adaicaḥ are the adesas of the word orddhih. 
षष्ठीनिर्दिष्टस्यादेशा उच्यन्ते, न चात्र षष्ठीं पश्यामः 
Adesas are for it that is in the sixth case (explicit or implied). We do not see here the sixth case. 
आगमास्तहींमे स्युः, वृद्धिशब्दस्यादैच आगमाः 
Then may these be augments; addicaḥ are the augments of the word wrddhih. 
आगमा अपि षष्ठीनिर्दिष्टस्यैवोच्यन्ते, लिङ्गेन च। न चात्र षष्ठीं न खल्वप्या- गमलिङ्गं पश्यामः 
Agamas also are for it that is in the sixth case or they are denoted to be such by some distinguishing mark. We do not see here either the sixth case or the agamalinga. 
इदं * खल्वपि भूयः सामानाधिकरण्यमेकविभक्तिकत्वं च ; द्वयोश्चैतद्भवति 
Samanadhikaranya and ekavibhaktikatva are here; this happens only in two cases. 
कयोः ! 
In which two cases? 
विशेषणविशेष्ययोर्वा संज्ञासंज्ञिनोर्वा 
In the cases wherein they are the word qualified and the qualifying word or samjna and samjnin. 
इदम् अत्र of इदमहममुमवबाध (शतपथम् 1-3-5-7). 
188 
VRDDHYĀHNIKA-वृद्धिरादैच् 
तत्रैतत्स्याद्विशेषणविशेष्ये इति 
Of the two, let this be the case of visesana and viseşya. 
तच्च न, द्वयोर्हि प्रतीतपदार्थकयोर्लोके विशेषणविशेष्यभावो भवति । न चादैच्छब्दः प्रतीतपदार्थकः । तस्मात् संज्ञासंज्ञिनावेव 
No, it is not; for visisana-visesya-bhāva happens in the world only in the case of two whose meaning is definitely known. Here the meaning of adaic is not clear. Hence they are santjñā and samjin. 
तत्र त्वेतावान् सन्देहः - कः संज्ञी का संज्ञेति 
There, it is only this doubt, which is samjnin and which is sanjja. 
स चापि क सन्देहः ? 
Where then does that doubt arise? 
यत्रोभे समानाक्षरे । यत्र त्वन्यतरल्लघु सा संज्ञा, यद्गुरु स संज्ञी 
Where both have the same number of syllables. Where, on the other hand, one has smaller number of syllables and another larger number of syllables, the former is samjñā and the latter is samjin. 
कुत एतत् ? 
Wherefrom is this? 
लघ्वर्थ हि संज्ञाकरणम् ! 
For indeed it is for brevity that samjñas are made! 

[[9]]

तत्राप्ययं नावश्यं गुरुलघुतामेवोपलक्षयितुमर्हति 
There too it does not invariably signify the guruta and laghatā, 
किं तर्हि ? What then ? 
अनाकृतितामपि । अनाकृतिः संज्ञा, आकृतिमन्तः संज्ञिनः, लोकेऽपि ह्याकृतिमतो मांसपिण्डस्य देवदत्त इति संज्ञा क्रियते 
The state of being without akrti also.. That which has no akrti is samjna and those that have akrti are samjnins. In the world too the name Devadatta is given to the mass of flesh which has ākrti.. 
अथवा आवर्तिन्यः संज्ञा भवन्ति । वृद्धिशब्दश्चावर्तते, नादैच्छब्दः । तद्यथा 
इतरत्रापि देवदत्तशब्दः आवर्तते, न मांसपिण्डः 
Or those which are repeated are sanjññās. 
The word vrddhi 
is repeated and not ādaic. The same is the case elsewhere. also the word Devadattaḥ is repeated and not the mass of fflesh. 
अथवा पूर्वोच्चारितः संज्ञी, परोच्चारिता संज्ञा 
Or the first-mentioned is samjnin and the next-mentioned is samjna. 
कुत एतत् ! 
Whence is this? 
सतो हि कार्यिणः कार्येण भवितव्यम्, तद्यथा इतरत्रापि सतो मांसपिण्डस्य देवदत्त इति संज्ञा क्रियते 
For operation comes only when there is an operator. The same is seen even elsewhere-the name Devadattaḥ is given only to the existing mass of flesh. 
190 
VRDDHYĀHNIKA-वृद्धिरादैच् 
कथं वृद्धिरादैजिति ! 
Then how is it vrddhiradaic? (in other words, why is the order inverted here ?) 
एतदेकमाचार्यस्य मङ्गलार्थं मृष्यताम् । माङ्गलिक आचार्यो महतः शास्त्रौधस्य मङ्गलार्थं वृद्धिशब्दमादितः प्रयुङ्क्ते । मङ्गलादीनि हि शास्त्राणि प्रथन्ते वीरपुरुषकाणि भवन्त्यायुष्मत्पुरुषकाणि चाध्येतारश्च वृद्धियुक्ता यथा स्युरिति । सर्वत्रैव हि व्याकरणे पूर्वोच्चारितः संज्ञी, परोच्चारिता संज्ञा, अदेगुणः इति यथा 
This one used by Acarya for the sake of mangala may be passed over. Acarya, eager of mangala, used at the com- mencement, the word vrddhiḥ to serve as mangala for his great work; for, only such works have mangala at the commencement thrive well, making the readers strong, long-lived and prosperous. In the whole vyākarana, the first mentioned is samjnin and the next mentioned is samjna cf. adai gunah. 
Having definitely mentioned the criterion to decide which is samjñā and which is samjiin, he reopens the topic of sam jnādhikāra which he closed by saying न च यथा लोके तथा व्याकरणे.

दोषवान्खल्वपि संज्ञाधिकारः; अष्टमेऽपि हि संज्ञा क्रियते तस्य परमाम्रेडितम् इति, तत्रापीदमनुवत्यै स्यात् 
Samjnadhikara will be defective too; For there is samjñā sitra like तस्य परमाम्रेडितम् in the eighth chapter. There too this samjñādhikara should have its influence. 
अथवाऽस्थानेऽयं यत्नः क्रियते, न हीदं लोकाद्भिद्यते । यदीदं लोकाद्भिद्येत ततो यलाई स्यात् । तद्यथा-अगोज्ञाय कश्चिद्गां सक्थनि कर्णे वा गृहीत्वोपदिशति अयं गौः इति; न चास्मायाचष्टे इयमस्य संज्ञेति, भवति चास्य संप्रत्ययः 
Or this attempt is inopportune, for this is not different from what is met in the world. If this is different from what happens in the world, then it deserves to be specially treated. For example, one takes hold of a cow by its thigh or ear and tells another ignorant of it this is a cow'; but he never tells him that it is her sumjna. Correct impression is formed in the mind of the hearer. 
तत्रैतत्स्यात् कृतस्तत्र पूर्वैरभिसम्बन्धः इति 
There, this may be said that the sanjna-sanjii bhāva was. determined by the forefathers. 
इहापि कृतः पूर्वैरभिसम्बन्धः 
Here too the relation has been determined by the fore- fathers. 
कैः ? By whom? 
आचार्यैः By the ācāryas. 
तत्रैतत्स्यात् यस्मै तर्हि संप्रत्युपदिशति तस्याकृतः इति

VI 
सतो वृद्धयादिषु संज्ञाभावात् तदाश्रय इतरेतराश्रयत्वादप्रसिद्धिः 
On account of inter-dependence, samjna coming in when samjnin exists and samjnin being comprehended through samjnas, there is no clear comprehension in the words vrddhi etc. 
सतः संज्ञिनः संज्ञाभावात्, तदाश्रये संज्ञाश्रयेसंज्ञिनि, वृद्धयादिष्वितरेत- राश्रयत्वादप्रसिद्धिः 
When sanjitin exists, there is need for naming it; the samjnin is comprehended through samjña. Hence there is inter-dependence. 
On that account there is no clear comprehension of the words wrddhiḥ etc. (In sutras like mr jsh orddhih.) 
का इतरेतराश्रयता ? 
How is interdependence? 
सतामादैचां संज्ञया भवितव्यम्, संज्ञया चांदैचो भाव्यन्ते । तदेत- दितरेतराश्रयं भवति; इतरेतराश्रयाणि च कार्याणि न प्रकल्पन्ते; तद्यथा नौर्नावि बद्धा नेतरत्राणाय भवति 
There should be adaic so that samjna may be given to it; and through samjña they are made to exist. This is interdependence. Deeds which are interdependent are not accomplished. For instance ship attached to another ship is not able to come to its rescue (while sinking). 
193 

[[5]]

ननु च भोः, इतरेतराश्रयाण्यपि कार्याणि दृश्यन्ते, तद्यथा नौः शकटं वहति, शकटं च नावं वहति 
Oh! we see even the interdependent deeds being accom- plished. For instance ship carries cart and cart carries ship. 
अन्यदपि तत्र किंचित् भवति जलं स्थलं वा; स्थले शकटं नावं वहति, 
जले नौः शकटं वहति 
Another - thing is there, water or land; cart carries ship on land and ship carries cart on water. 
यथा तर्हि त्रिविष्टब्धकम् 
So then a holder (of books) made of three planks (may serve as an example.) 
तत्राप्यन्ततः सूत्रकं भवति । इदं पुनरितरेतराश्रयमेव 
There too exists the string (which keeps them together). Here there is only interdependence. 
सिद्धं तु नित्यशब्दत्वात् 
Our object is gained on account of the nityatva of Sabda. 
सिद्धमेतत् 
Our object is gained. 
कथम्? How ? 
नित्यशब्दत्वात् । नित्याः शब्दाः, नित्येषु शब्देषु सतामादैचां संज्ञा क्रियते ; 
न च संज्ञया आदैचो भाव्यन्ते 
(It is so) since sabda is nitya. Sabdas are nitya ; when Sabdas are nilya, samjna is given to ādaic which already existed; their existence is not brought out by the sanjna.

यदि तर्हि नित्याः शब्दाः किमर्थं शास्त्रम् ? 
If sabdas are nitya, what for is the sāstra ?

If it is asked what for the sastra is, its existence is established on account of its warding capacity. 
निवर्तकम् शास्त्रम् 
Sāstra has the capacity to ward off. 
कथम् ? How ? 
सृजिरस्मायविशेषेणोपदिष्टः, तस्य सर्वत्र मृजिबुद्धिः प्रसक्ता, तत्रानेन निवृत्तिः क्रियते मृजेरङित्सु प्रत्ययेषु सृजिप्रसङ्गे मार्जिः साधुर्भवति इति 
The root mrj is read generally. Hence it is taken that it comes everywhere. Then this sutra (mrjih vrddhih) prohi- bits it. It says that, when it is followed by pratyayas which are neither kit nor nit, marj is the correct form in the place of mrj. 
VII 
* [ वृद्धिगुणसंज्ञयोः प्रत्येकं वचनम् वृद्धिगुणसंज्ञयोः प्रत्येकग्रहणं वक्तव्यम् ] 
Need for the word pratyēka in the first two sutras. The word pratyēka should be read in the first two sutras. 
प्रत्येकं वृद्धिगुणसंज्ञे भवत इति वक्तव्यम् 
It should be said that the samjna, vrddhiḥ and gunah apply to each (of adaic and aden respectively.)

The word saha

अन्यत्र सहवचनात्समुदाये वृद्धिगुणसंज्ञयोरप्रसङ्गः । यत्रेच्छति सहभूतानां कार्य करोति तत्र सहग्रहणम् । तद्यथा सह सुपा, उभे अभ्यस्तं सह इति 
Since the word saha is read elsewhere, there is no possibility for the samjña, vrddhiḥ and gunah to be applied collectively. Where he wants anything collectively, he reads the word saha. viz, Saha supā, abhe abhyastam saha. 
प्रत्यवयवं च वाक्यपरिसमाप्ते : 
On account of the fruit of the meaning of the sentence being seen individually. 
प्रत्यवयवं च वाक्यपरिसमाप्तिर्दृश्यते । तद्यथा देवदत्तयज्ञदत्तविष्णुमित्रा भोज्य- न्तामिति । न चोच्यते प्रत्येकमिति । प्रत्येकं च भुजिः परिसमाप्यते 
The fruit of the meaning of the sentence is seen individually. For instance, in the sentence देवदत्तयज्ञदत्तविष्णुमित्रा भोज्यन्ताम् the word is not used. The fruit of eating is seen individually. 
ननु चायमप्यस्तिं दृष्टान्तः समुदाये वाक्यपरिसमाप्तिः इति । तद्यथा गर्गाः शतं दण्ड्यन्ताम् इति । अर्थिनश्च राजानो हिरण्येन भवन्ति, न च प्रत्येकं दण्डयन्ति Oh! the other nyaya also is found that the fruit of the action is found collectively. viz. Gargāh Satam dandyantām. Kings want money and they do not fine them individually.

If, in the presence of this nyāya, the word saha is read, here too the word pratyēkam should be read. If, without the use of the word saha, action may take place collectively, here too can it take place individually without the use of the word pratyēkam. 
Here it may be noted that there is slight difference. in their views between Varttikakära and Mahabhasyakara; the former does not take cognisance of the nyāya समुदाये वाक्यपरिसमाप्तिः and hence thinks that there is need for the word saha in that case and there is no need for pratyēkam in the other case. Mahabhaṣyakara, on the other hand, wants saha there and pratyēkam here, if one does not take recourse to the nyayas or does not want them both, since the same can be determined by the application of the two nyayas mentioned above.

Oh! there are gunas which do not sometimes differentiate. For instance as Devadatta, is not bereft of his name

Since the Acarya mentions the word udatta in the sutra asthi.., he indicates that gunas are abhidakas. If guras are bhidakas, he would have pronounced the words with udatta 
accent. 
यदि तर्हि अभेदका गुणा अनुदात्तादेरन्तोदात्ताच्च यदुच्यते तत्स्वरितादेः स्वरितान्ताच्च प्राप्नोति 
If, then, gunas are abhedakas, that which is said for & word which has its first syllable anudatta, or its last syllable udatta, will be applied to a word which has its first syllable svarita or the last syllable svarita. 
नैष दोषः, आश्रीयमाणो गुणो भेदको भवति, तद्यथा शुक्लमालभेत कृष्णमालभेत, तत्र यः शुक्ल आलब्धव्ये कृष्णमालभते न हि तेन यथोक्तं कृतं भवति This is no defect. The guna that is spécifically mentioned along with the object serves as a differentiating element. For instance when it is said Tie to the stake the white', Tie to the stake the black', if one ties the black when the white has to be tied, he has not done as is ordained.

There is this doubt alone. In all cases of doubt we take recourse to this that detailed knowledge arises from the commentary and hence doubt does not enable the sastra to be neglected.

The word is used. What for? To ward off guna (a) in the place of ā, diphthongs and consonants. 
First as regards the warding off a from being sthanin of guna, guna may replace a by the sutra (sarvadhatukärdhadhalukayōh) while the words yātā and vata are formed; it does not take place on account of the use of . As regards diphthongs, guna (e) may replace ai while the words glayati and mlayati are formed; it does not take place on account of the 
203 
use of इक्. 
LECTURES ON PATANJALI'S MAHABHAṢYA 
As regards consonants, guna (a) may replace consonants while the words umbhitā, umbhitum, and umbhi- tavyam are formed; it does not take place on account of the use of इक्. 
आकारनिवृत्त्यर्थेन तावन्नार्थः । आचार्यप्रवृत्तिर्ज्ञापयति नाकारस्य गुणो भवतीति, यदयम् आतोऽनुपसर्गे कः इति ककारमनुबन्धं करोति 
First it is not to ward off guna to ā. Acārya's use suggests that guna does not replace a, since he uses the anubandha 'k' in the sutra-ātōnupasargi kah. 
कथं कृत्वा ज्ञापकम् ? 
In what manner should it be understood so that it may be taken as jñāpaka? 
किकरणे एतत्प्रयोजनं विङतीत्याकारलोपो यथा स्यात् यदि चाकारस्य गुणः स्यात् कित्करणमनर्थकं स्यात्, गुणे कृते द्वयोरकारयोः पररूपेण सिद्धं रूपं स्याद् गोदः कम्बलद इति; पश्यति तु आचार्यो नाकारस्य गुणों भवतीति, ततः ककारमनुबन्धं करोति 
This is the benefit of kitkarana, that a may be elided by the sutra frafa...; if guna can replace a, kitkarana will be of no use; for, in the formation of the word godak, go-dd-a will become go-da-a if guna replaces à, and then go-d-a if pararūpa comes (by the sūtra ato guna'). So also is kamba- lada. But Acarya sees with his mind's eye that guna does not replace a and hence uses the anubandha k'. 
भविष्यति 
सन्ध्यक्षरनिवृत्त्यर्थेनापि नार्थः ; उपदेशसामर्थ्यात् सन्ध्यक्षरस्य गुणो न 
It is not also to ward off guna to diphthongs since guna cannot replace a diphthong on account of the significance of their being read separately.

It is not also to ward off guna to consonants since the use of dit by Acarya in the sutra (saptamyam) janer dah suggests that guna does not replace & consonant. 
कथं कृत्वा ज्ञापकं ? 
In what manner should it be understood so that it may be taken as jnapaka? 
डित्करणे एतत्प्रयोजनं, डिति इति टिलोपो यथा स्यात् । यदि च व्यञ्ज- नस्य गुणः स्याद् डित्करणमनर्थकं स्यात्, गुणे कुते त्रयाणामकाराणां पररूपेण सिद्धं रूपं स्यात् उपसरजो मन्दुरज इति । पश्यति त्वाचार्यो न व्यञ्जनस्य गुणो भवतीति, ततो जनेड शास्ति 
The use of dit-karana is that the final syllable may be dropped if it is followed by a dit. If consonant were to be replaced by guna, dit-karana will be of no use; for after guna replaces the consonant, the forms upasarajaḥ and mandurajah will be got by applying the sutra dealing with pararupa twice. But Acarya sees with his mind's eye that guna does not replace a consonant and hence uses dit in the sutra saptamyam janer dah 
नैतानि सन्ति ज्ञापकानि । यत्तावदुच्यते कित्करणं ज्ञापकं नाकारस्य गुणो भवतीति, उत्तरार्थमेतत्स्यात् तुन्दशोकयोः परिमृजापनुदोः इति 
These are not jñāpakas What was first put forth that kit-karana in atōnupasarge kah suggests that guna does 
mandura - jana: mandura-jaa-a: manduraja

not replace a does not stand; for it is useful in the interpretation of the sutra tunda sōkayoh parimrjāpanudoh. * 
यत्तर्हि गापोष्टक् इत्यनन्यार्थ ककारमनुबन्धं करोति, 
If so, kitkarana in the sutra gapostal serving no other purpose suggests it. 
यदप्युच्यते उपदेशसामर्थ्यात् सन्ध्यक्षरस्य गुणो न भवतीति, यदि यद्यत्सन्ध्य- क्षरस्य प्राप्नोति तत्तदुपदेशसामर्थ्याद्वायते, आयादयोऽपि तर्हि न प्राप्नुवन्ति 
The other point that was put forth that guna cannot replace a diphthong on account of the significance of their separate upadāśu, if acceded, will lead to this :- whatever takes places to diphthongs, it will be warded off by the separate upadesa and hence (the adesa) ay etc. cannot function. 
नैष दोषः यं विधिं प्रत्युपदेशोऽनर्थकः स विधिर्वाच्यते, यस्य तु विधेर्निमित्तमेव नासौ बाध्यते, गुणं च प्रत्युपदेशोऽनर्थकः आयादीनां पुनर्निमित्तमेव 
This (objection) cannot stand; for the vidhi in respect of which updesa is of no use is warded off and that in respect of which it is only nimitta, it is not warded off; in respect of guna, it is of no use and in respect of ay etc., it is only nimitta. 
यदप्युच्यते जनेर्डवचनं ज्ञापकं न व्यञ्जनस्य गुणो भवतीति, सिद्धे विधिरा- रम्यमाणो ज्ञापकार्थो भवति, न च जनेर्गुणेन सिध्यति । कुतो ह्येतत् जनेर्गुण उच्यमानोऽकारो भवति न पुनरेकारो वा स्यादोकारो वेति ?

If so, the nasalised a may come. 
पररूपेण शुद्धो भविष्यति 
It becomes non-nasalised by para-rupa (since the a that follows it is a non-nasalised one.) 
एवं तर्हि गमेरप्ययं डो वक्तव्यः, गमेश्च गुण उच्यमान आन्तर्यतः ओकारः 
प्राप्नोति । तस्मादिग्ग्रहणं कर्तव्यम् 
* 
If so, this dit should be read for gam also; for if it is said that guna replaces m in gam, ō will replace it by closer similarity t. Hence ik should be read in this sutra. 
From the foregoing part it may be clear that, according to the purvapaksa, ikah need not be read here and so the two sūtras-iko gunavrddhi and na dhatulopa ardhadhatuke may be read together. The siddhanta says that the word ikah is needed here to prevent ō replacing m in gam and hence iki gunavrddhi should be read as a separate sutra. 
After the sutra-saptamyam janer dah (III, 2, 97), the sutra anyescapi drsyate (III 2, 10) is read. If the root gam is taken under the word anya, this answer holds good. 
† Similarity referred to here is that both are labials.

VRDDHYĀHNIKA-इको गुणवृद्धी 
अथवा उभयं निवृत्तम्, तदपेक्षिप्यामहे 
Or both are not taken by anuvrtli, but we take them by adhyāhāra. 
It may be noted here that the anuertti of the words vrddhi and guna is dealt with in seven ways. First the word wrddhi is taken to the third sutra through the second. The objection raised therein was that a, è & will get the appellation of vrddhi also. (2) It was met by the statement that the word vrddhi alone is not taken to the second, but wrddhi attached to ādaic. The defect here is how adaic alone was made to recede. (3) Then the principle of Frog-leap' was applied. Recourse is taken to it only in cases where there is no other go. (4) Hence he wishes to take the sutras one and two as one. It was so done on the idea that there will be no anuertti in one and the same sutra. But sometimes it is seen that there is anuvrtti even in one and the same sutra. (5) Hence he takes recourse to the point that the appellation guna serves as an apavada to the appellation vrddhi to a, è and ō. The defect here is this:-The uddesya in the apavadasutra is that which is otherwise qualified to be the uddesya in the utsarga- sutra. Here the uddesya of the utsarga is ādaic and that of the apavada is aden. (6) Then he says that yatna and not anuvrtti alone serves the purpose. Here the defect is this:- the expression gunavrddhi in the third sutra suggests that the expression supplied from the previous two sutras is samjñāpara and that suggests that this is arthapara. (7) Hence the author takes recourse to the practice found in the world that we take in only those that we want. 
Both refers to guna and ryddhi.

वृद्धिगुणावलोऽन्त्यस्येति चेन्मिदिमृजिपुगन्तलघूपधच्छिदृशिक्षिप्रक्षुद्रोष्विग्ग्रहणम् 
If guna and vrddhi are taken to happen to the final al, the word ik has to be read where guna or vrddhi is enjoined to mid, mrj. pugantalaghapadha, rech, drs, ksipra and ksudra. 
In the interpretation of the sutra sarvadhätukärdhadhatukayoḥ there is anuertti of angasya and gunah. Since the former is in the genitive case, alontyasya appears on the scene. By the mention of the latter, ikah appears on the scene; Hence arises this doubt. 
The word taccheṣaḥ may be taken here as bahuvrihi and talpuruşa 
Sesa Sasi-bhāva is here paricchādya-paricchālaka-bhāva.

If it is taken that guna and wrddhi happen only to the final al, the word ik has to be read where guna or vrddhi is enjoined to mid, mrj, pugantalaghūpadha, rech, drs, ksipra and ksudra; midir gunaḥ, ikaḥ should be added, for i cannot be replaced by guna since it is not final; mrjervrddhiḥ, ikah should be added, for r cannot be replaced by vrddhi since it is not final; pugantalaghupadhasya gunah, ikaḥ should be added, for it cannot be replaced by guna since it is not final; recher liți gunah, ikaḥ should be added: for r cannot be replaced by guna since it is not final; rdrsoni gunah. ikah should be added, for it cannot be replaced by guna since it is not final; kṣipraksudrayörgunaḥ, ikaḥ should be added, for i or u cannot be replaced by guna since it is not final.

Possibility of sarvadisa to the angas which do not end in ik.

Guna will replace the whole if the anga does not end in ik as in yātā, vātā.

[[3]]

The genitive mentioned in alonlyasya goes with the final ik. The genitive in angasya is sthānasaṣṭhi. Hence if guna is enjoined to an anga which does not end in ik, it should replace the whole of it. 
नैष दोष:, यथैव सलोऽन्त्यस्येति षष्ठी अन्त्यमिकमुपसंक्रान्ता एवमङ्गस्येत्यपि स्थानषष्ठी, तद्यदिदानीमनिगन्तमङ्गं तत्र पष्ठयेव नास्ति, कुतो गुणः कुतः सर्वादेशः ? 
The objection does not stand; just as the genitive mentioned in alōntyasa goes with the final ik, so also is sthanaṣasthi in angasya; for there is no genitive in the anga which does not end in ik. Hence where is the possibility of guna or sarvadīša? 
एवं तर्हि नायं दोषसमुच्चयः 
If so, they are not two coordinate defects. 
किं तर्हि ? What then ?

The second is subordinate to the first; the word ca is read in the sense of hi. Il: should be read in the sutras-mider- gunah etc; for the anga which does not end in ik will be wholly replaced by adisa. 
मिदेर्गुणः, इक इति वचनादन्त्यस्य न, अलोऽन्त्यस्य इति वचनादिको न, उच्यते च गुणः, स सर्वादेशः प्राप्नोति, एवं सर्वत्र 
The sūtra, mider gunahby the sūtra iko gunavrddhi' guna does not replace the final; by the sītra 'alōntyasya', it does not replace ik. But guna is enjoined and hence it should be a sarvādāsa.

Thinking that it is another paribhāṣā, krōstriyas read that the sutra 'iko gunavrddhi' operates against alōntyasya by purva- vipratiṣedha 
यदि चायं तच्छेषः स्यात्, तेनैव तस्यायुक्तों विप्रतिषेधः; अथापि तदपवादः, उत्सर्गापवादयोरप्ययुक्तो विप्रतिषेधः । तत्र नियमस्यावकाशः राज्ञः क च राजकीयम्, इको गुणवृद्धी इत्यस्यावकाशः चयनं चायको लबनं लावकः इति । इहोभयं प्राप्नोति मेद्यति मार्ष्टि इति, इको गुणवृद्धी इत्येतद्भवति विप्रतिषेधेन 
If it is tacchesa, there is no occasion for vipratiṣedha, or if it is tadapavada, then too there is no occasion for viprati- Of them sedha between general rules and exceptions. alontyasya operates when the word rajakiyam is formed by the sutra rajñaḥ ka ca' and iko gunaorddhi operates when the words cayanam, cāyakah, lavanam, lāvakah etc. are formed, while the words midyati and märsti are formed, both begin to operate; but ikōgunavrddhi operates prohibiting 
the latter. 
नैष युक्तो विप्रतिषेधः, विप्रतिषेधे परम् इत्युच्यते, पूर्वश्चायं योगः, परो नियमः 
This vipratiṣedha is not proper; for it is said that, in conflict between two rules, the latter prohibits the former and this sutra is the former and alontyasya is the latter. 
इष्टवाची परशब्दः, विप्रतिषेधे परं यदिष्टं तद्भवति इति 
The word para means the needed one. In conflict, that which is needed operates. 
एवमप्ययुक्तो विप्रतिषेधः, द्विकार्ययोगो हि विप्रतिषेधः, न चात्रैको द्विकार्ययुक्तः । 
It means the conflict between two sûtras where the former 
prohibits the latter. 
218 
VRDDHYĀHNIKA-इको गुणवृद्धी 
Even then the vipratiședha is not proper; for there is occasion for vipratiṣedha only if one thing is to be operated upon by two sutras and here there is none which is to be operated by two. 
नावश्यं द्विकार्ययोग एव विप्रतिषेधः 
Vipratisedha does not invariably occur when one alone is to be operated by two. 
किं तर्हि ? What then ? 
असम्भवोऽपि स चास्त्यत्रासंभवः 
Non-happening too; that asambhava is found here. 
कोऽसावसम्भवः ! 
What is that asambhava? 
इह तावद् वृक्षेभ्यः प्रक्षेभ्यः इति एकः स्थानी द्वावादेशौ न चास्ति सम्भवः यदेकस्य स्थानिनो द्वावादेशौ स्याताम्; इहेदानीं मेद्यति मेद्यतः मेद्यन्ति इति द्वौ स्थानिनौ एक आदेशः, न चास्ति संभवः यत् द्वयोः स्थानिनोरेक आदेशः स्यात् इति; एषः असंभवः, सत्येतस्मिन्नसंभवे युक्तो विप्रतिषेधः 
At first in the examples vrksibhyaḥ, plaksebhyah there is one sthänin and two adigas and it cannot be that one sthänin has two adesas; on the other hand, in the examples medyati, medyataḥ, medyanti there are two sthanins and one ādēsa and it cannot be that two sthänins can have one adesa; this is asambhava and when there is this asambhava, vipratisedha can fit in. 
एवमप्ययुक्तो विप्रतिषेधः, द्वयोर्हि सावकाशयोः समवस्थितयोर्विप्रतिषेधो भवति, अनवकाशश्चायं योगः 

[[9]]

Even then vipratiṣedha cannot fit in; for there is opportunity for vipratiṣedha only when the two sutras have room to operate elsewhere; and this sutra has nowhere else to operate. 
ननु च इदानीमेवास्यावकाशः प्रकॢप्तः चयनं चायको लवनं लावक इति ? 
Is it not then that its operation is settled in the cases of cayanam, cāyakal, lavanam, and lāvakah etc. ? 
.?. 
अत्रापि नियमः प्राप्नोति 
Even here ‘alōntyasya' begins to operate. 
नाप्राप्ते नियमेऽयं योग आरम्यते 
This sutra is read when alontyasya invariably begins to 
operate. 
यावता च नाप्राप्ते नियमेऽयं योग आरभ्यते, ततस्तस्य अपवादोऽयं योगो भवति । उत्सर्गापवादयोश्च अयुक्तो विप्रतिषेधः 
If, then, this sītra is read when alontyasya begins to operate, this becomes its apavada and there is no vipratiṣedha between utsarga and apavāda. 
अथापि कथंचिद् इको गुणवृद्धी इत्यस्यावकाशः स्यात्, एवमपि यथेह विप्रतिषेधादिको गुणो भवति मेद्यति मेद्यतः मेद्यन्ति इति, एवमिहापि स्यात् अनेनिजुः पर्यवेविषुः इति 
Even if, with difficulty, room is found for iko gunavṛddhi to operate, guna will occur by vipratisedha in anānijuh, parya- vevisul in the same way as it accurs in mādyati, mādyatak, mādyanti etc.

Another word in the genitive case appears. It is our pleasure to take it as an adjunct to the already existing word in the genitive case or to take the latter qualifying ikah. Since it is our pleasure, we take the word in the genitive case to qualify ikaḥ in the case of midimrjipuganta- laghupadharcchidrsikşiprakṣudra, and in the case of 'jusi- sarvadhatukärdhadhätukahrasvadi we allow the word, to be qualified by ikaḥ-guna replaces these which are iganta. 
Having dealt with the six topics, Mahabhasyakara tries in a way to meet the objections raised in the taccheṣapaksa.

Or in all these places sthanin is mentioned. First in the sutra-mider gunah the word mideh is made up of two words mid and ch where mid is in the genitive case 
case without the case-suffix; or it is the genitive of midiḥ which is a sasthitatpurusa. The sutra-pugantalaghupadhasya is not interpreted as pugantangasya and laghipadhasya. How then? 
it is taken as the genitive of pugantalaghupadham which is a dvandva compound made up of pugantah and laghupadha which are respectively split as puki antaḥ and laghvi upadha. This needs be said; for, otherwise guna will appear in the words bhinatti and chinatti. In the sutra-rechatyrtam ? is separately mentioned so that it may be split as rechati, r, r, rtām. As regards rdrsoni gunah, it is split into two sitras, urani gunah and drśaḥ, so that guna replaces r when it is followed by an and guna replaces r of drs when it is followed by an. With respect to kṣipraksudra, since, though the desired object is won by reading the word gunah after the word yayādiparam in the sutra-sthala- dura- yuva - hrasva- legipra- ksudrānāmyanādiparam pūrvasya ca gunaḥ, he needs the word purva, it has this prayojana that guna replaces ik and does not replace anik. Hence it must be noted that nothing has been said about mrjervrddhiḥ and the sutra-rdrsoni gunah is split in a different order. Hence this topic is intended only to serve as a supplementary discussion to try whether taccheşapaksa can stand.

For the sake of niyama, so that it takes place only in those places where kit or it begins with a vowel and not in other places. What are those places where it should not be?

If so vrddhi should be mentioned for the sake of this sutra on behalf of sic so that the erddhi that is enjoined before sic may replace an ik and not an anik. 
कस्य पुनरनिकः प्राप्नोति ? 
For which anik is there the possibility to be replaced by orddhi? 
अकारस्य, अचिकीर्षीत् अजिहीर्षीत् 
For akara; viz. acikirşit, ajihirşit. 
नैतदस्ति, लोपोऽत्र बाघको भवति 
No, the lopa (enjoined by ate lopah) prevents its operation. 
आकारस्य तर्हि प्राप्नोति, अयासीत् अवासीत् 
If so, there is that possibility for akára viz. ayasit, avasit. 
In acikirşa-it, a is dropped by até lopaḥ. 

[[7]]

नास्त्यत्र विशेषः, सत्यां वृद्धावसत्यां वा 
Here is no difference whether there is vrddhi or not. 
• सन्ध्यक्षरस्य तर्हि प्राप्नोति 
If so, there is that possibility for diphthongs. 
नैव सन्ध्यक्षरमन्त्यमस्ति 
There is no diphthong which is final. 
ननु चेदमस्ति ढेलोपे कृते उदवोढम्, उदवोढाम् उदवोढ इति ! 
Oh, here it is when is elided viz. udavodham, udavidham udavidha ! 
नैतदस्ति, असिद्धो ढलोपः, तस्यासिद्धत्वात् नैतदन्त्यं भवति 
No, it is not; dhalopa is taken to be non-existing; since it is asiddha, diphthong is not the final letter. 
व्यञ्जनस्य तर्हि प्राप्नोति, अभैत्सीत्, अच्छेत्सीत् 
If 30. there is that possibility for consonants-abhāitsīt, acchāitsait. 
हलन्तलक्षणा * वृद्धिर्वाधिका भविष्यति 
Vrddhi that is enjoined to the vowel of the angas that end in consonants prevents its operation. 
यत्र तह सा प्रतिषिध्यते, नेटि इति अकोषीत् अमोषीत् 
(What do you say) where it is prohibited by the sutra- niti viz. akāsit, amāsīt ? 
This means that which is enjoined to the vowel of the anga that ends in a consonant by the sutra-vadavrajahalantasyacaḥ. 
228 
VRDDHYĀHNIKA-इको गुणवृद्धी 
सिचि वृद्धेरप्येष प्रतिषेधः 
This is the prohibitive rule also for the sutra sici erddhih... 
कथम् ? How ? 
लक्षणं हि नाम ध्वनति, भ्रमति, मुहूर्तमपि नावतिष्ठते 
For nisedha suggests vaguely, wanders everywhere and does not stand still even for a moment. 
अथवा सिचि वृद्धिः परस्मैपदेषु इति सिचि वृद्धिः प्राप्नोति, तस्या हलन्तलक्षणा वृद्धिर्बाधिका, तस्या अपि नेटि इति प्रतिषेधः 
Or vrddhi before sic is enjoined by the sutra-sici vrddhih parasmāipadisu; it has its apavāda in the sutra-vadayraja- halantasyacaḥ and it has its apavada in neți. 
अस्ति पुनः क्वचिदन्यत्रापि अपवादे प्रतिषिद्धे उत्सर्गोऽपि न भवति ? 
Is there another place where the general rule does not operate when there is an exception to the exception? 
अस्तीत्याह ; सुजाते अश्वसूनृते, अध्वर्यो अद्रिभिः सुतम्, शुक्रं ते अन्यत् इति; पुर्वरूपे प्रतिषिद्धे अयादयोऽपि न भवन्ति 
Yes, says, he viz. sujate ascastinrti, adhvaryo-adribhik sutam, Sulceram tē anyat; here though purvarūpa is prohibited, the adesas ay etc. have not replaced è etc. 
उत्तरार्थमेव तर्हि सिजथे वृद्धिग्रहणं कर्तव्यम्, सिचि वृद्धिरविशेषेणोच्यते, 
सा क्ङिति मा भूत्, न्यनुवीत् न्यधुवीत् 
If so, let the use of the word wrddhi be intended for the the next siūtra to prohibit vrddhi enjoined by sici vrddhih :... vrddhi before sic is enjoined in general and let it not operate when it is followed by kit or nit viz. nyanuvit, nyadhuvit. 

[[9]]

नैतदस्ति प्रयोजनम्, अन्तरङ्गत्वादत्र उवङादेशे कृते अनन्त्यत्वाद् वृद्धिर्न भविष्यति 
No, this is not the purpose to be served; for, after uvanādēsa which first operates by antarangaparibhasa, there is no occasion for vrddhi since the vowel is not the final element of the aiga. 
यदि तर्हि सिच्यन्तरङ्गं भवति, अकार्षीत् अहार्षीत्, गुणे कृते रपरत्वे चानन्त्यत्वाद् वृद्धिर्न प्राप्नोति 
If, then, antarangaparibhāṣā prevails in sicivrddhi, the words akārṣit, aharșit cannot be. formed since the final element of the anga is not a vowel after the operation of the sutras enjoining guna and raparatva. 
मा भूदेवम् हलन्तस्य ... 
35 
इत्येवं भविष्यति 
Let it not be in that manner; the sutra- halantasya... operates (and the desired form is obtained). 
इह तर्हि न्यस्तारीत् न्यदारीत्, गुणे कृते रपरत्वे चानन्त्यत्वाद्वृद्धिर्न प्राप्नोति हलन्तलक्षणायाश्च नेटि इति प्रतिषेधः 
Then in the words nyastarit, nyadarīt, vrddhi cannot come in after the sutras enjoining the guna. and raparatva operate since the vowel is not final and the sutra vadavrajahalan- tasya... bannot operate since it is prohibited by the sutra niti 
मा भूदेवम्, लान्तस्य इत्येवं भविष्यति 
This cannot be, for it will happen by the sutra-ati Irāntasya. 
इह तर्हि अलावीत् अपावन, गुणे कृतेऽवादेशे चानन्त्यत्वात् वृद्धिर्न प्राप्नोति । हलन्तलक्षणायाश्च नेटि इति प्रतिषेधः 
230 
VRDDHYĀHNIKA-इको गुणवृद्धी. 
Then in the words alāvit, apāvit, erddhi cannot come in after the sutras enjoining guna and avadesa operate, since the vowel is not final and the sutra-cadavrajahalantasyācaḥ is prohibited from operating by the sutra-nēti. 
मा भूदेवम्, लान्तस्य इत्येवं भविष्यति 
This cannot be, for it will happen by the aitra-atō lrāntasya. 
लान्तस्य इत्युच्यते, न चेदं लान्तम् 
It is said when the final is I or r, and this is not having or r as its final. 
लान्तस्य इत्यत्र वकारोऽपि निर्दिश्यते 
V also is mentioned in Iranta. 
किं वकारो न श्रूयते ! 
Why is not heard ? 
लुप्तनिर्दिष्टो वकारः 
Vakara has been dropped. 
यद्येवं मा भवानवत् मा भवान् मवीत्, अत्रापि प्रामोति 
If so, erddhi might come in ma bhavan avit and ma bhavan mavit. 
अविमव्योर्नेति वक्ष्यामि 
I shall say that it does not come in the case of avi and mavi. 
तद्वक्तव्यम् 
It should be said. 

[[1]]

न वक्तव्यम्, णिश्विभ्यां तौ निमातव्यौ 
No, it need not be said; they should be exchanged by i and Sovi. 
यद्यप्येतदुच्यते, अथवैतर्हि णिव्योः प्रतिषेधो न वक्तव्यो भवति, गुणे कृतेऽयादेशे च यान्तानां नेत्येव प्रतिषेधो भविष्यति 
Though this is said so, there is no need for the mention of ni and svi in the sutra hmyantakṣaṇasvasajāgrṇiśvyēditām; for, after they take guna and ayadesa, they are prohibited from taking orddhi since they end in y." 
एवं तर्द्धाचार्यप्रवृत्तिर्ज्ञापयति न सिच्यन्तरङ्गं भवति इति यदयं अतो हलादेर्लघोः इत्यकारग्रहणं करोति 
The vyavahara of Acarya suggests that the antarangaparibhāṣā does not operate in the application of the sutra sici vrddhik parasmāipadisu. 
कथं कृत्वा ज्ञापकम् ? 
How is it to be interpreted to make it a jnapaka? 
अकारग्रहणस्यैतत्प्रयोजनम्, इह मा भूत् अकोषीत् अमोषीत् यदि सिच्यन्तरङ्गं स्यात् अकारग्रहणमनर्थकं स्यात्, गुणे कृतेऽलघुत्वाद्वृद्धिर्न भविष्यति, पश्यति त्वाचार्यो न सिच्यन्तरङ्गं भवतीति, ततोऽकारग्रहणं करोति 
The mention of akara has this use that it may not happen in akāsīt, amāsīt; if antararigasāstra prevails in sici vrddhih, the use of akára will be of no use since there is no short penultimate after guna comes. Hence seeing that antaranga- śāstra does not prevail there, he uses akāra. 
नैतदस्ति ज्ञापकम्, अस्त्यन्यदेतस्य वचने प्रयोजनम् 
No, this is not a jnāpaka, for there is a purpose in having said it. 
232 
किम् ? What ? 
VRDDHYĀHNIKA - इको गुणवृद्धी 
यत्र गुणः प्रतिषिद्ध्यते तदर्थमेतत्स्यात् न्यकुटीत् न्यपुटीत् इति 
Where guna is prohibited, it is used there to prohibit vrddhi viz. nyakutit, nyuputit. 
यत्तर्हि णिव्योः प्रतिषेधं शास्ति, तेन नेहान्तरङ्गमस्ति इति दर्शयति 
Then since prohibition is enjoined for ni and svi, Acarya suggests that antarangaparibhāṣā does not prevail here. 
यच्च करोत्यकारग्रहणं लघोरिति कृतेऽपि 
And since akara is read even though there is the word laghoh. 
तस्मादिग्लक्षणा वृद्धिः 
Therefore vrddhi should be enjoined to ik. 
* पष्ठ्याः स्थानेयोगत्वादिनिवृत्तिः 
VIII 
Genitive being supplemented by sthane, all iks will disappear. 
षष्ठ्याः स्थानेयोगत्वात् सर्वेषामिकां निवृत्तिः प्राप्नोति । अस्यापि प्राप्नोति 
दधि मधु 
Since the genitive (whose meaning is not defined) is supple- mented by the word sthāne, all iks will disappear. The ik of dadhi and madhu will also disappear. 
पुनर्वचनमिदानीं किमर्थं स्यात् ? 
What for, then, is the repetition ? f. 
The purvapaksa says that this is a vidhayakasutra and the siddhanta is that it is a paribhaṣā. 
+ As in midār gupal. 
233 

[[0]]

अन्यतरार्थं पुनर्वचनम् 
The repetition is to choose one of the two. 
अन्यतरार्थमेतत्स्यात् – सार्वधातुकार्धधातुकयोर्गुण एव इति 
- 
This is to choose either of the two viz. guna alone in the operation of the sutra-sarvadhatukardhadhalukayōh. 
• प्रसारणे च 
In the case of the sutra dealing with samprasarana. 
प्रसारणे च सर्वेषां यणां निवृत्तिः प्राप्नोति, अस्यापि प्राप्नोति याता वाता 
When the sutra dealing with samprasarana operates, all yans will disappear. The y and v in yālā and vātā also will disappear. 
27 
पुनर्वचनमिदानीं किमर्थं स्यात् ? 
What for is, then, the repetition ? 
विषयार्थं पुनर्वचनम् 
Repetition is to decide the circumstances. 
विषयार्थमेतत्स्यात् वचिस्वपियजादीनां कित्येवेति - 
This is to decide the circumstances viz. samprasarana takes place to vac, svap, yaj etc. only when they are followed by kit. 
उरण् रपरे च 
In the sutra furan raparah' also. 
This takes places when yanah in ig yanaḥ samprasaranam is 
taken to be a athanaṣasthi, which is always the case.. 
234 
VRDDHYĀHNIKA-इको गुणवृद्धी 
उरणूरपरे च सर्वेषासृकाराणां निवृत्तिः प्राप्नोति, अस्यापि प्राप्नोति - -कर्तृ हर्तृ 
In the application of the sutra, all rkärus will disappear; it will disappear in the words lkartr, hartr also. 
सिद्धं तु षष्ट्यधिकारे वचनात् 
The end is achieved by reading it after sasthi sthāneyōgā. 
सिद्धमेतत् ; कथम् ? 
This is achieved. How ? 
षष्ट्यधिकारे इमे योगाः कर्तव्याः । एकस्तावत् क्रियते तत्रैव, इमावपि 
योगौ षष्ठ्यधिकारमनुवर्तिष्येते 
These sutras have to be read after sasthi sthānēyōgā. One- Uran-raparah is read there and the other two are taken there. 
अथवा षष्ट्यधिकारे इमौ अपेक्षिष्यामहे 
Or we require them in sasthyadhikara. 
अथवेदं तावदयं प्रष्टव्यः सार्वधातुकार्धधातुकयोर्गुणो भवति इति इह 
कस्मान्न भवति याता वाता ! 
Or he should first be put this question why guna does not take place in yata and vātā by the sutra sarvadhatukärdha- dhātukayōh'. 
इदं तत्रापेक्षिष्यते इको गुणवृद्धी इति 
This sutra iko gunavṛddhi' is read along with it. 
यथैव तर्हि इदं तत्रापेक्षिष्यते एवमिहापि तदपेक्षिष्यामहे सार्वधातु- कार्धधातुकयोः इति 

[[5]]

As it is read with it there, so also it is read with sarvadhätukärdhadhatukayok in interpreting its meaning. 
Hence it must be noted that प्रसारणे च and उरणपरे च have been mentioned as parallel cases.. Mahabhāṣyakara first mentioned the difficulties met with, if this sutra is taken a vidhisútra and finally suggested three ways to avert the difficulties, of which the last is the best, where he takes the sutra only as a paribhāṣā.
