20 कृत् and तद्धित-प्रत्ययाः, च्वि, Nominal Derivation and Sanskrit Vocabulary


20.0

20.1

The grammatical complexity of Sanskrit is such that, in the first year, it tends to overshadow other areas of language learning, especially the acquisition of a working vocabulary. Nonetheless, the major features of the grammar will soon, through constant repetition, become quite familiar. Vocabulary, on the other hand, tends to loom as a greater issue when one begins reading Sanskrit texts. With Sanskrit, more perhaps than other languages, the beginning student feels that he or she never seems to be able to learn enough words so that he or she can obtain some modicum of freedom from the dictionary.

There are a number of reasons for the extraordinary richness of the Sanskrit lexicon. One of the reasons concerns the deri vation of nouns and adjectives from verbal roots. Despite the relatively small number of verbal roots in common use, it is possible, through the use of the 344-1-s and a wide variety of derivational suffixes, to make a given root the base for a large number of words. By combinations and permutations of the 34621-s and suffixes, it would easily be possible to generate a hundred words from a single root. Mastery of the more impor tant of these suffixes, like a knowledge of the 34679-s, is, therefore, of immense help in the task of acquiring a working Sanskrit vocabulary. Sanskrit derivational suffixes are called Yeri-s and fall into two major categories depending upon whether they are added directly to a UTC or to some more complex form. Suffixes that are added directly to a verbal root are called a pris (pri mary suffixes), while those added to a formalready derived by कृत् or other derivation are called तद्धित प्रत्यय-s (secondary suf

fixes). For example, from the root v4 (awaken), we may derive, by means of a familiar कृत् प्रत्यय -त,' the form बुद्ध (भूते PGRI) (awakened, enlightened, the Buddha). Then, from this F derivative, we may further derive, by means of a alga pera,

(a follower of the enlightened one, a Buddhist). The most important ca-s and their basic functions are best leamed according to their basic category (i.e., कुत् or तद्धित), and within each category, according to their significance. Be fore going on to examine the yepy-s, however, it is essential that you be thoroughly familiar with the grades of vowel strength called ju and al(3.5-7). These vowel grades are often characteristic of the various kinds of nominal derivation, and it is difficult to relate many forms to their underlying forms without a clear, virtually automatic, knowledge of the grades of the simple vowels. If you cannot immediately see that the words GRR11, 2729, 2A, SIG, 3174, and I are derived from GRAI, TY, FACT, TG, # and V5 respectively, go back to 3.5-7 and learn the vowel grades thoroughly. Major op Hep-s

derivation is primary in that it depends on the simple ver bal U19-s of the language. Although all three vowel grades (no strength, Tu and alg) occur in various examples of orderi vation, it is a fair generalization to say that ju is the most characteristic while the other two are less common. There is one group of H R -s that should by now be quite familiar to you. These—the participial, infinitive, gerundive, and gerund suffixes such as -a, -7, -14, -404, -7, -37-112, -cai, and -234-have been discussed elsewhere. There remain, however, a number of R-s that are used to derive nouns and adjectives from the verbal roots. Such de rivatives differ somewhat from the participles in that they generally lose their verbal character insofar as they do not so clearly have opel-s and 24-s in sentences.

IS a

a. faay

The simplest of these suffixes, is the zero, or feqq er. Derivative nouns with this suffix consist simply of the verbal root with or without an 3440f. Such forms are rela tively rare and are restricted to a few items, mostly Fit nouns expressing the action of the root. Examples: Root

Derivative दृश् (see)

दृश (f) (sight)

(608) Vyu (fight)

(f) (fight, battle)

( YED(see 3.25.a) 34 + A + VHG (1P) 347796 [-(f) (upanişad) (sit down near (Fical) H4 + VÆG (1P) HHT (- (f) (assembly) (sit together)

R + VHG (1P) upra (-a) (1) (assembly) (sit around) 311 + V96 (1P) 31146 (-2) (f) (calamity, (undergo misfortune)

misfortune)

The 1994 444, however, is more common in forms occurring at the end of compounds (see 12.17). Here, it forms an agent noun, i.e., a noun identifying the agent of the action of the root. Unlike action nouns, agent nouns can take any gender, depending on the inherent gender of the person or thing iden tified as agent. Examples: VETI (9P) (know)

: (knower of everything) VFG (1P) (conquer) 15 (conqueror of Indra) (see 21.1) VGT (3P) (give) a (m prop) (boon giver,

Brahmā)

b. 31

This is the most important derivational suffixes in the lan guage. It is added freely to a large number of roots and with them forms of a great number of action nouns mostly

10. Before this suffix, the following changes in the root

occur: 1. A root vowel, if capable of Ju (i.e., in a light syllable or a

final long vowel), takes it. (In fact, this suffix is largely

restricted to such cases.) 2. Medial 31 is subject to ale, but this is not invariably the

case. 3. Some final vowels are likewise subject to g. 4. A ou (palatal) Furt, and sometimes in root final posi

tion revert, before the 21, to their corresponding usz (velar). Examples: Root

Derivative Vis (1P) (conquer) 314: (m) (conquest, victory) VF4. (4P) (be angry) 14: (m) (anger) VpU (4P) (be angry) tu: (m) (anger) 3G + V (2P) (go up) 394: (m) (ascension,

i. A few words of this derivation are neuter.

Example: ni (3P) (fear)

14 (n) (fear) ii. A few are agent nouns.

Examples: V (8P) (do) (at end of compounds) (doer,

maker, agent) HIER: (m) (light-maker, sun) कुम्भकारः (m) (pot-maker, potter). Vमिह (1P) (emit fluid, urinate) Àa: (m) (cloud)

-371 A number of roots, especially those whose vowels do not qualify for Ju or IG (i.e., short in heavy syllable or long non-final, see 7.16), form Fill action nouns with the suffix आ. Examples: Root

Derivative VHq (1A) (serve) Hal (1) (service) VAN (1Ā) (speak) 491 (f) (speech, language) Vents (1P/Ā) (play) SI (1) (play, sport) VER(10P) (think)

Famill (1) (thought, anxiety)

As seen in Lesson 18, this suffix routinely forms action nouns from the ER desiderative) stem.

Examples: Root 1944 (4A) (think) Vary (1Ā) (ward off)

Derivative Hial (f) (inquiry)

Chi (f) (disgust)

d. -377

The suffix -37, like -37, is one of the most productive and important of the non-participial o 24p4-s. Like -37, it forms action nouns freely from many roots. Before it, root vowels generally take fun if they can. In contrast with the -31 Yep, -37 forms nouns mostly in the h o . Final

1504 (palatal) consonants are unchanged before -37A. Action nouns of this group sometimes take on a sense of object nouns, i.e., nouns indicating the object of an action, or, in the case of 3744 roots, nouns indicating the locus of action. A few are agentive. Examples: Root

Derivative VITA (1P) (go) 1474 (n) (going)

(2P) (kill) 6774 (n) (killing) Vवच

(2P) (speak) 444 (n) (speech) (3P) (give) 1974 (n) (giving, gift)

-37:

This suffix forms a fairly restricted group of predominantly 747105 action nouns. Before it, root vowels take ju if possible (see 9.0-9.4). Examples: Root

Derivative Vतप् (1P) (burn, 24: (n) (austerity)

perform austerity) vaz (2P) (speak) : (n) (speech)

मन् (4A) (think)

(n) (mind, thought) 1774 (1P/A) (bow, 74: (n) (homage, bow)

do homage)

47:

.f.

This suffix forms many important Eiros action nouns. Before it, roots are generally unchanged or weakened, ex actly as before the -त of the भूते कृदन्त. Examples: Root

Derivative V14 (1P) (go) fa: (f) (gait, path, way,

going (see 6.1.b)) 9 + V3114 (5P) (attain)

3ft: He:

(f) (speech, saying) (f) (creation) (f) (pleasure, love making)

i. The common root v4G (4Ā), "go," forms 4: (f), "go

ing," despite the fact that the L GR is (see 10.12). This important root occurs only with 347-s. Examples: 37 + 196 (be born, 3c4fa: (f) (birth,

arise, originate) origin, arising) fa + V96 (experience fayfa: (f) (misfortune)

calamity) सम् + Vपद् (experience संपत्तिः (1) (good fortune)

good fortune)

g. 41

This suffix forms action nouns from a few roots. The nouns are mostly 798 5. Before the suffix, root vowels are subject to गुण. Examples: Root

Derivative 1514 (4Ā) (be born) 54 (n) (birth) VF (8P) (do, make) 49 (n) (action, karma,

grammatical object)

h. -5

- This प्रत्यय forms agent nouns in the पुंलिङ्ग and नपुंसकलिङ्ग. Corresponding Fils nouns are formed with the suffix Fil. Before these 4424-s root vowels take ju if possible. They may be added to many roots. The suffix ? is the same one discussed in connection with stems in final # (10.0-3) and the C (16.12.2). It is added to the stem with or without the vowel 5 as noted at those places. Examples: Root

Derivative (8P) (do)

Before this suffix, certain roots in which a consonant precedes the sequence 3T are changed as follows: 34 → 317; & →&. (See 10.8.d). Example: VaE (1P) (carry) at (m, n) (carrier)

-3755 This प्रत्यय forms पुंलिङ्ग and नपुंसकलिङ्ग agent nouns. Its Fillos equivalent is usually -501, although -376h1 and 3707 are occasionally seen. It is used fairly freely. Before it, medial short vowels take 14, medial 31 and final vowels

Tic. Examples: Root

Derivative V (1P) (lead) 70: (m, n) (leader, hero)

Aifa (f) (heroine (in

The above are by no means all of the opp -s. They are, however, the most important and commonly used. The others do not generate enough forms to warrant your learning them. It is sufficient to learn the individual forms without worrying

about their derivation. You should, however, make yourself familiar with the above list of suffixes and the ways in which they work. तद्धित Derivation Just as the 224-s are used to generate a variety of nouns from the verbal roots, so the ca -s enable one to build new nominal forms based on the meanings of other nominal stems. The underlying nominal forms are called upta. The forms thus derived are of several types. Two of these, however, are most important. a. Derivative adjectives.

i. These are normally derived from nouns and indicate

that their fazlea (modificand) is in some way related to the lata. Examples: प्रकृति

Derivative 47: (n) (mind) HH (adj) (mental) sos: (m) (world) collabots (adj) (worldly) 984: (m) (man) 46.44 (adj) (human,

pertaining to men)

ii. Such adjectives are themselves often stereotyped as

nouns, especially when they refer to people who know or study the thing indicated by the प्रकृति. Examples: प्रकृति

Derivative Ollohu14 (n)

duchu (adj) (pertaining (the science of

to grammar, but grammar)

more commonly: elut: (m) (a grammarian)

iii. This kind of nominalization is regularly stereotyped

in the derivation of proper names from those of some parent or ancestor.

378

Examples: प्रकृति

Derivative GER4: (m) (Daśaratha) GERT: (m) (son of

Dasaratha, e.g.,

Rāma) grafit (f) (Kunti) 4: (m) (son of

Kunti; e.g., Arjuna)

b. Abstract nouns. This important class of nouns is derived

freely from both nouns and adjectives. If X is any noun and Y any adjective, the derivations are usually best trans lated X-hood, the state of being an X; Y-ness, the state of being Y. Examples: प्रकृति

Derivative शीत (adj) (cold) 144 (n) (cold, coolness) युवन्

(adj) (young) 1944 (n) (youth) 964: (m) (man) focal (f) (manhood)

20.10

Just as ju of a root vowel is a frequent characteristic of derivation, a characteristic mark of the aici derivation is aic. A number of the most important of the area feri-s require aic, which occurs in the initial syllable of the yefa. This rule has one relatively important exception. When the first vowel of an underlying form is immediately preceded by the semi vowel or 7, especially where the semi-vowel is the result of an external HP change of the final vowel of a quasi-indepen dent word (e.g., the 344-0-s , fa- or the coumpound forms - or -), this semi-vowel is first analyzed into 54 or 34, and the als then applies to the vowel (5 or 3). This applies to all area suffixes requiring वृद्धि. Examples: प्रकृति

Derivative 42014 (n) (grammar) 216241:(m) (grammarian)

(fa-311-2014)379

PR: (m) (logic) of: (f) (individual)

tulp: (m) (logician) Rifat (adj) (personal,

individual) Hae: (m prop) (son of

Svaśva)

Folat

(m prop) (-37:)

When a semi-vowel preceding an initial vowel is not the result of external HAU, the regular rule applies. Example: प्रकृति

Derivative Faen (m prop) (F2-4) Faria: (m) (son of

(the god Brahmā)

Brahmā)

20.11 The most important of the area fri-s are:

a. -37

This suffix is as important among als as its phonologi cal twin is among the A-s (20.6.b). It has four basic meanings, the first two of which are somewhat more im portant than the others. The meanings are: 1. 37440181 (genealogical descent) 2. Hallo (abstraction) 3. Jean

(possession) 4. JAG

(knowledge) The suffix has a Fitas counterpart, $. Both require are of the first syllable of the sofa. 37 (and $) are added to nominal stems as follows: i. They replace final 37 or 311.

Examples: प्रकृति

Derivative (m) (son) 417 (m) (grandson) 4711 (f prop) 4 : (m prop) (son of

(Yamunā river) Yamunā) uda: (m) (mountain) 9106 (f prop) (daughter of

the mountain)

ii. They replace final $.

Example: प्रकृति सरस्वती (f prop)

ened. Example: प्रकृति

Derivative त्वष्ट (m prop) त्वाष्टः (m prop) (son of

Tvaşır)

V.

They are added directly to consonant stem finals. In the case of final 3TR the weak form 3 is the base. Examples: प्रकृति

This suffix is also of great importance. It is used to form a great number of nouns, mostly High (abstract), which are generally नपुंसकलिङ्ग. वृद्धि of the first syllable is general, but a number of forms show no strength. The suffix re places any stem-final vowel and is added to any stem-final consonant.

There are a number of suffixes which indicate the pos sessor (स्वामिन्) of the प्रकृति. These are said to beस्वामित्ववाचक (expressive of ownership). These have already been in troduced in the various paradigms. They are -R-OR, -59, and -104. (See 11.3 and 12.0-12.3 respectively.) Examples: प्रकृति

Derivative 981: (m) (wing) 7 (m) (bird) 49: (n) (asceticism) auto (m) (ascetic) 423: (m) (cattle) 34R (ad) (rich in cattle)

(f) (memory) Fahd (adj) (having a good

memory)

*m. 3robefalet gere

There are two unrelated sets of RR-s that are used to form comparative and superlative grades of adjectives. They are said to be 360649196 (expressive of superiority): i. -CR-comparative

-04- superlative These are added to any adjectival stem. If the stem is one that has a twofold distinction of strength, then the weaker is used; if the distinction is threefold, the middle grade is used. The object of comparison is usually in the 450 fauft.

387

Examples: Adjective प्रिय (dear)

महन्त् (great)

Comparative प्रियतर (dearer)

महत्तर (greater)

Superlative प्रियतम (dearest) 46014 (greatest)

ii. -$4:comparative

-566—superlative These are technically F RRA-s, before which a root is subject to yo. Relatively few roots take these forms in the classical language, and even then, the deriva tives are not often really related to their roots. Therefore, it is best simply to learn a few important forms. Each of the following examples shows the ad jective corresponding in meaning, not the underlying verbal root. Examples: Adjective Comparative Superlative YRIA (good) |T (better) BS (best) गुरु (heavy) गरीयः (heavier) गरिष्ठ (heaviest) युवन् (young) कनीयः (younger) कनिष्ठ (youngest) TE (old) 51: (older) 548 (oldest)

n.

iii. The declension of the superlative ending in 58 is like

that of any adjective in 31; its Flic ending is 31. On the other hand, the declension of comparatives in $4: is quite irregular. It will be given in the following

chapter. (See 21.4.) - This ri, added to any noun (stem final consonants are treated as in compounds), forms an adverb conveying the sense of “like” the referent of the world. (See 21.6.a.ii.a) Example:

Derivative (m) (monkey) 1496 (ind) (like a monkey)

प्रकृति osta

20.12

The fed repa a. This fre is treated separately from the others for two rea

sons. First, it is common and extremely versatile. Second it requires a subsidiary element, either a finite form or a derivative of the roots vp or V4. The Trupi itself is $, and it is added in place of a final vowel or directly to a final consonant. It requires no strength in the Topta. In meaning, the ita construction is rather like one use of the 149 (denominative—18.27-30), in that it indicates that a thing either becomes or is made into, literally or

figuratively, something that it is not. d. When an intransitive, reflexive sense is desired, a form of

the root v4 is used. When the transitive sense is desired, a form of the root vş is used (see 18.29.) The effect of this is to create a series of new complex “roots." Examples:

Derivative Poul (adj) (black) कृष्णीभू (1P) (to become

black) (8P) (to make black, to blacken)

प्रकृति

From these “roots" can be made any finite form and any

a derivation that can be made from the simple roots vom and V4. Note that in the formation of the gerund, the foc affix has the effect of an 3471 (see 11.7). Examples: कृष्णीभविष्यति (TOC) (it will become black) कृष्णीकरणम् (n) (blackening) कृष्णीकृत

(adj) (blackened) कृष्णीकृत्य

(gerund) (having blackened)389

e.

The fed construction has several important usages. i. If the yetà is a noun, then it indicates a genuine change

of state. For example: नृपो बालकं सैनिकीकरोति । (The king makes the boy into a soldier.) If the yeafa is an adjective, then the form indicates a change of quality:

नारी चन्दनेन स्तनद्वयं शुक्लीकरोति । (The woman whitens her breasts with sandalwood.)

ii. Perhaps an even more important usage of the fed is in

a figurative sense. Here the change of state is not real. The subject either acts like (V2), or, more often, treats or regards something like (V) the referent of the yefa. Example: अरे ते राजपुरुषास्तपोवनं नगरीकुर्वन्ति । (Hey! These policemen are turning the penance grove into a city (i.e., they are making noise and generally acting as though they were in a city).)

भो मारुते त्वया क्रमता शतयोजनविस्तीर्णसागरो गोष्पदीकृतः । (O Māruti (Hanumān]! You, in leaping, have turned the ocean, a hundred leagues across, into a puddle in) a cow's hoofprint.)

iii. Idiomatic usage: The adjective 79,"one's own," and

the indeclinable 35 (ind) (exclamation of agreement), “OK,” are used idiomatically with the fear and V to indicate acceptance, either mental or physical. Examples: इदं भोजनं स्वीकर्तव्यं भवता । (or स्वीकरोतु भवान् ।) (Please accept this food, sir.)

तादृशं वाक्यं न कदाप्यङ्गीक्रियते भारतदेशे । (Such speech is never accepted (agreed to) in India.)

20.13

Examples of the use of various Yeri-s. Virtually all of the Sanskrit you have learned so far has been illustrative of the principles of nominal derivation. However, a few remarks on some of the uses of this principle may be helpful. a. One valuable result of the system of suffixes is that it makes

possible a very precise and systematic evolution of techni cal terminology. Consider the root VRT (7P) with the 34H0f •fa' in the sense of “qualify, specify.” Although finite forms of the verb are not common, its nominal deri vations are very useful. Thus: i. 1914, “qualification," is used in grammar to indi

cate an adjective. farten (gerundive),"to be qualified," then means the noun modified by an adjective. The factor4, of course,

is विशिष्ट, “modified," by the विशेषणम् etc. ii. The poetic terms 3441 (f), “simile,” 3444 “subject of

comparison," and 3441 "object of comparison" are

derived from 34 + VAT (2P), “compare." iii. By use of the various suffixes one can derive many of

the important grammatical terms from the root vor. Example:

(subject) कर्मन्

(object) करणम् (instrument) क्रियापदम् (action word, verb)

कारकम्

(case relation) b. Juxtaposition of two (or more) derivations of the same root

can, by virtue of the significance of the Year, make for very powerful conciseness of speech. Example: कृतकृत्यः (बहुवीहि समास) "one who has done what he had to."

कर्त

391

C.

Here, eight English words are needed to express what can be expressed by one word in Sanskrit. Again, take the example, feu9014 (11947P-grind) "the grinding of the ground" (i.e., beating a dead horse), where five English words are needed to express one Sanskrit word.

The capacity of Sanskrit for concise utterance, through a combination of derivational techniques, nominal compo sition, and the connotative power () of the case endings, is nowhere better employed than in the 21143-s, or schol arly texts. Example:

अविद्या परिहर्तव्या जन्ममरणादिलक्षणसंसारोत्पत्तिहेतुत्वात् । (Ignorance is to be shunned because of its being the cause of the origination of the cycle of re-birth, which is charac terized by birth, death, and so forth.)

Note here how the one compound, even though it has seven members, requires twenty-three words in an English ren

dering. d. The different "meanings of the different suffixes make

for a virtually unlimited freedom of paraphrase. Take, for example, the term बुद्धवचनम् =बुद्धस्य वचनम्) "the speech of the Buddha.” By subjecting the EGR "96," which here is a noun, to further als derivation, one can generate the adjective ale, “Buddhist,” “pertaining to the Buddha.” One can then substitute the कमेधारय समास बौद्धवचनम् for the origi nal dy. Likewise, derivatives of adjectives like 48, "clear," and ta, "fast," can be used variously to convey more or less the same meanings: Examples: i. they can be used adjectivally

gia sa rai (The swift horse runs.) स्पष्टं वचनं वदति ।

(He speaks clear speech.)

392

ii. or adverbially,

378: tai yrafa स्पष्टं वदति ।

(The hose runs swiftly.) (He speaks clearly.)

iii. or, by alan derivation, they can be made into abstract

nouns which can then be put in an appropriate case, 37: TEZU yafai (The horse runs by swiftness

[i.e., swiftly).) स्पष्टतया वदति । (He speaks with clarity (i.e.,

clearly).)

e.

As a final example of the usefulness of learning the major suffixes, consider the following partial list of derivations of the root vis (7P),"join, harness, yoke, concentrate the mind."
