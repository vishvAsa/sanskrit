17 परोक्षभूते लिट् (The Perfect); The Perfect Participle


17.0

17.1

17.2

The foc, or “perfect," is the last of the finite verbal conjuga tions in very frequent use. Like the 5, it functions as a simple narrative past. The term “perfect,” like the term "imperfect," was given to the form by Western philologists and has no sig nificance with regard to "aspect" or duration of action or states expressed The traditional Indian grammatical texts do attempt to distin guish the functions of the two forms (5 and foc). They say that the expresses 3PERA , or past time (not today) that was witnessed directly by the speaker, while the foc ex presses Ra l , (past time not directly perceived) an action not witnessed by the speaker. In fact, however, as is the case with all parts of the verbal system (cf. 16.15, etc.), such dis tinctions are not generally maintained in actual usage. The me, then, is used as yet another simple preterite tense. Thus, the following sentences all mean the same thing. (No translation, it is to be hoped, is necessary.) रामो वनं गच्छति स्म । (लट्) रामो वनमगच्छत् । (1951) रामो वनं गतः । (भूते कृदन्त) रामो वनं गतवान् ।

dag or ‘past active participle') रामो वनं जगाम । (fic) Use of the fore The general use of the fore, then, requires no particular com ment. a. It might, however, be noted here that by an extension of

the grammarians' prescription of the form for a time, poetic (and pedantic) usage may reserve the 3774464 forms of the foc for actions of which the speaker (who is also the

294

subject) has no clear recollection, or is unconscious. Such usage is, of course, rare. Example: उन्मत्त इव बह प्रललप राजसमीपे । (I prattled on like a drunkard in the presence of the king.)

b. The foc also has a few stereotyped usages. When in epic

or purāņic texts a new speaker is introduced, this is gener ally marked by his or her name or title and the appropriate forç of the root vaz. Examples: <TH 34 (Rāma said) 77474 377 (the rși-s said)

Commentators on texts often use the root V3T6 (say), which occurs only in the fore, to suggest or paraphrase what the author on whose work they are commenting is going to say. Thus: GHIGIE 14: H IGCE 1 (“What did Rāma do after going to the forest?” He (i.e., the author] now says.) At the end of some purāņic texts, the Ten oso port of V374 is used to indicate the end of a narrative. The phrase used is sta zla (a + 3 + 311H) (Thus it was...). The phrase in time has become a noun ŞRETH: (m) (history,

chronicle, legend, or story). -- Formation of the लिट

The forms of the forc, however, present a wide and initially intimidating variety of phonological and morphological con tingencies. These need not be memorized immediately. It is important, however, to leam to recognize foc forms and how to generate some of the more important ones. This is made much simpler by the fact that, within certain limits of varia tion, most forms exhibit one or more of a number of typical and easily recognizable characteristics. These signs are:

295

17.5

17.6

a. The use of 382H (reduplication) in the formation of the

लिट् stem. b. Characteristic strong-weak alternation in the foc stem. c. Special personal endings. All of these features involve a certain amount of irregularity which will be discussed separately under each heading.

अभ्यास : Reduplication The most characteristic feature of the “perfect" system is that virtually all its stems are formed by the peculiar process known as 372|18. This is the same process introduced in connection with the third of the present system (7.22-25). In fact, the particular rules for fort 37211H are much the same as those for the third 14. There are, however, some differences and some additional rules. Only the latter are detailed below, so review carefully the rules for the formation of present stems of the third 74 a. Treatment of consonants

Root consonants are treated just as in the present stems of the third ". Note, however, that the consonant of the root vf (conquer) and the consonant of the root vel (kill) are changed to quod (velar) sounds in the root por tion of the fort stems. Examples: root Rose VEST (1P) SHIRT (he conquered) VET (2P) 5781 (he killed)

b. Treatment of root medial and final vowels

i. Root vowel + always becomes 37 in the 3121H syl

lable (cf.7.23.b). Examples: root või (do) PAR (he did) Vu (bear) HR (he bore) (cf. faut (@])

लिट्

296

ii. Other non-initial root vowels reduplicate as in the

present stems of the third 1, but a very important exception, which must be learned immediately, is that the root v4 has as its 37 , so that its foc stem is a

(see 17.9.a below). iii. Certain common roots beginning with a (and in the

case of 451, 9) followed by a single final consonant (cf.9.27.d) are subject in several forms to a distinctive weakening. This process is known as HYHRY These roots, e.g., Vaz, vag, vay, val, vall, Vae, and V451, take respectively their YARU vowel (i.e., 3 or 3) as their 3p2iH syllables. This, in turn, is prefixed to the full (or strengthened) grade of the root in strong forms (see 17.8.f). In weak forms, however, the root, too, is subject to Haru and the contact of the two similar short vowels yields the corresponding long vowel (3.3). Root Strong foc form Weak for form Vaa (P) (say) 3918 (he said) 1: (they said) यज् (P) इयाज (he sacrificed) ईजुः (they sacri

(sacrifice)

ficed)

c.

Treatment of root initial vowels i Roots with initial vowels may form the reduplicated

I only if the syllable of the root is (light). San skrit syllables are considered either ? (light) or 5 (heavy) depending on the nature of their vowel. a. Long vowels, vowels, and any vowels that

immediately precede a consonant cluster, अनुस्वार,

or विसर्ग are गुरु (cf. 7.16). b. Short vowels, unless they precede a cluster, 37gfar,

or fahrt, are my. Roots with a les vowel (as in i. above) in initial position do not form a redupli cated fat but have a corresponding form, the

297

periphrastic perfect, which is treated below (17.18). The only exception to this rule is the root V3119 (5P) (obtain), which forms a reduplicated forç

as though from a root V*374. ii. Root initial short vowels

a. The vowel 31 (and the 311 of V3114) are redupli

cated, and the result of the contact of the two vowels is, of course, 31. Examples: V374 (P) (be) 311A (he was) V3E (P) (say) 31 (he said)

V3114 (P) (obtain) 3114 (he obtained) b. Initial 5 and 3 are likewise reduplicated, but the

coalescence of the two short vowels to a long oc curs only in weak forms (see 17.13). In strong forms: 1. the root vowel is subject to M, and 2. the 31218 is separated from it by its corre

· sponding semi-vowel. Example: Root Strong foc Weak fase Vइष (wish) इयेष (wished) ईषुः (they wished)

17.7

c. Do not worry about roots beginning with . There are two important exceptions to the rules regarding 3p24|TH. a. If a root fulfills all of the criteria listed below, then in weak

forms only (see 17.13), it is subject to the phenomena of i. 31214014 (loss of reduplication), and ii. Tra (change of medial 37 to 9).

The criteria are: 1. The root must be of the form consonant-vowel

consonant with both consonants simple (i.e., not part of a cluster).

298

2. The vowel must be 31. 3. In general, the first consonant must be one which

is not altered in 372H (i.e., it must not be aspirate,

48 (velar) or 5. Examples: Root Strong

Weak Vतप् (be hot) तताप (he was तेपुः (they were

heated)

heated) V274 (curse) R14 (he cursed) TTY: (they cursed) आपत् (fall) पपात (he fell) पेतुः (they fell)

4. Some roots, however, will optionally undergo

अभ्यासलोप and एत्वम्,even though theydo not con form to the rules above. Examples: 1964 (to bear fruit) sex (they bore fruit) VHS (to share) #5: (they shared)

17.8

b. The root Vac (2P), “know," has no 372114 in its foc

forms. Furthermore, the form is commonly used as a present tense; calca GER a daga va doi: 1 A la Audi (All this [world) is truly Brahman. Who knows this, he alone is a knower of essential truth. He

will gain liberation.) Stem strength in the forme The perfect is exactly like the non-37 M-s of the present sys tem in its general distinction of strong and weak forms (7.9, 10). Here, too, the Tobach Hi4G forms are strong, while the others (द्विवचन and बहुवचन परस्मैपद and all the आत्मनेपद forms) are weak. a. In general, as with the present system, the distinction is

maintained by a strengthening of the root vowel of the strong forms while the weak forms retain the root vowel in its original grade.299

17.9

VO

i. This does not pertain to root initial 31. For the rules

governing other root initial vowels, see 17.6.c.ii. It is characteristic of roots with a final vowel that among the strong forms themselves there is a regular alternation of root vowel strength. The system of root final vowel strength in the strong forms is: Form

Vowel Strength प्रथमपुरुष वृद्धि मध्यमपुरुष गुण उत्तमपुरुष

गुण or वृद्धि Examples:

प्रथम

मध्यम

उत्तम vकृ (do) चकार

चकर / चकार भी (fear)

बिभाय बिभेथ

बिभय / बिभाय

चकर्थ

a. The extremely important root v4, however, is irregular in

this regard. Its root vowel is unstrengthened and is set off from vowel endings by its corresponding semi-vowel -व् (for irregular अभ्यास, seel7.6.ii above). . Example:

प्रथम०

मध्यम

उत्तम भू (be) बभूव

बभूविथ बभूव

17.10

b. For the treatment of root final 371, see 17.14.b. Root medial 31, which occurs very frequently, follows the anal ogy of root-final vowels in the strong forms. That is, it takes वृद्धि (=length) in the प्रथमपुरुष, गुण (=no change) in the मध्यम and optionally, गुण or वृद्धि in the उत्तम. Since roots with medial 37 are so common, their forms are among the most typical of the foc. The rhythm of the strong forms, particularly of the प्रथमपुरुष short-long-short (अ-आ-अ), is an easily recognizable sign of the perfects of the roots.

300

Examples: प्रथम

गम् (go) जगाम Vशक् (be able) शशाक

पत् (fall) पपात हिन् (kill) जघान

मध्यम जगमिथ शशक्थ पपतिथ जघन्थ

उत्तम जगम/जगाम शशक/शशाक पपत / पपात जघन /जघान

17.11

Other medial vowels are subject to qui in all strong forms Examples: Root

प्र एक VAG (split)

बिभेद Vकुप् (be angry) चुकोप

17.12 The above rules of stem strength in strong forms do not apply to

vowels which are गुरु (see 17.6.c.i). Such vowels take no strength and so their perfects do not exhibit the strong-weak distinction. Examples: Root

प्र० एक प्र° बहु Vचुम्ब् (kiss)

चुचुम्ब चुचुम्बुः (they kissed) निन्द् (rejoice) ननन्द

ननन्दुः (they rejoiced) 17.13 The weak forms usually show the root vowel with no change.

Examples: Root

Strong Weak vão (do)

चकार

चक्रुः (they did) छिद् (cut)

चिच्छेद

चिच्छिदिम (we cut)

However, a few roots with medial - 37-, but which, by reason of their first consonant's being subject to change in 37 , do not qualify for अभ्यासलोप and एत्वम् (17.7.a), show a weakening of their root vowel in the weak forms. This weakening, which has no bearing on the variable strength of the strong forms as shown at 17.10, involves the complete loss of the root vowel. The four most important roots that exhibit this phenomenon are Vहन् (kill), Vजन् (be bom), गिम् (go), and Vखन् (dig):

301

Examples:

गम् (P) रहन् (P) जिन् (A) Vखन् (P)

प्रथम एक

प्रथम बहु जगाम (he went) जग्मुः (they went) जघान (he killed) जघ्नुः (they killed) जज्ञे (he was born) जज्ञिरे (they were bom) चखान (he dug) चख्नुः (they dug)

17.14 The लिट् endings are as follows:

परस्मैपद एक द्वि बहु प्र° -अ [औ] -अतुः । -: म° -थ -अथुः -अ उ० -अ [औ) -व -म

एक -ए -से -ए

आत्मनेपद द्वि. बहु -आते -[इ) रे -आथे -ध्वे -वहे -महे

a. The PETG endings are generally peculiar to the perfect.

Only-व, -म, and-3: are the same as the corresponding sec ondary (e.g., लङ् or लिङ्) endings. On the other hand, the 311646146 endings are the same as the corresponding pri mary (e.g., लट्) endings-with the exception of the प्रथम एक and बहुवचन. It is important that you learm the प्रथमपुरुष endings at once. The bracketed ending -औ is the regular प्रथम° and उत्तम, एक° परस्मैपदending forroots with final आ (and, more rarely, संयुक्त vowels).

Examples: Root

प्रथम / उत्तम एक परस्मैपद Vया (go)

ययौ (he/I went) स्था(stand)

तस्थौ (he/I stood) VTTI (know)

जज्ञौ (he/ I knew) VGi (give)

ददौ

(he/I gave) Vपा (drink)

(he/ I drank)

(he/I sang) VET (place)

(he/I placed)

पपों

गै (sing)

जगा

दाभो

302

c.

These roots are also peculiar in that they lose their root vowels before any ending beginning with a vowel or pre ceded by the vowel 5. Example: Root

प्रथम बहु° परस्मैपद स्था

तस्थुः

17.15

These forms, particularly those ending in 3īt are also typi

cal and easily recognizable "perfect" forms. The foc endings that begin with consonants (-4,-2, -6, -7, -Ă, -E7, -, and -46) are, moreover, frequently separated from the perfect stem by the vowel 5. The application of this vowel, which is not wholly dependent upon whether the root in ques tion is अनिट, सेट, or वेट्, is summarized as follows: a. The gen , 46979, 3115H24G ending is always preceded

by ş. Since this rule has no exceptions, it is useful to re member this ending as -5? Examples: VAN → Hur (they spoke) VAI → HAR (they thought) (See 17.7.a.)

b. The मध्यमपुरुष, एकवचन, परस्मैपद ending -थ takes the s spo

radically. Many roots take it optionally, and in the case of those in final - 371, the root vowel is lost before it (17.14.c). For example: Root

→ Galer/afaa (you gave) c. The remaining six consonant-initial endings (-7, -H, -,

ta, -HE, and -26) may or may not take 5 but in practice almost always do so. Examples: Root

consonant endings VYN (Ā) CH1948 (we spoke)

303

VOTH (P)

pha (we two went) Vaa (P)

3faa (we two spoke) V40 (A)

Afta (you thought) (See 17.7.a.) d. Several roots ending in the vowels 3 and do not take the

ç except, of course, before-t. These roots are: (in 3)

(in ) VED (praise) V (do) VE (run, flow) V (bear) vę (flow) va (choose) VP (hear) VĘ (move) All of these roots are fairly common and some, like v and V, are extremely so. Examples:

(you did) चकृम (we did) शुश्रुव (we two heard)

चकर्थ

17.16

These, then, are the basic rules for the formation of the loc, Do not attempt at this point to memorize them all. Do, how ever, familiarize yourself with the varieties of formation and strength of the various perfect stems. Pay special attention to the basic types of foc sound patterns. Review these paragraphs several times. You should memorize all the gery endings with their typical forms for the types of roots mentioned above.

Some examples of the fore: वाल्मीकिरुवाच । यदा पिता स्वसुतविवर्णमुखं ददर्श तदा निःश्वसन्भूमौ निपपात। (Vālmīki said: “When the father saw the pale face of his own son, he fell sighing to the ground.")

17.17

भरतो राजा भविष्यतीत्युक्त्वा रामलक्ष्मणौ वनं जग्मतुः । (Having said "Bharata will be king," Rāma and Lakşmaņa went to the forest.)

304

वनं गत्वा श्रीरामचन्द्रो मुनिभ्यो ऽभयं ददौ । ततो दुष्टराक्षसानां शिरांसि सर्पदन्ततीक्ष्णशरैश्चिच्छेद । (Having gone to the forest, Sri Rāma gave fearlessness to the munis. Then he cut off the heads of the wicked rākşasas with arrows as sharp as serpents' teeth.)

तत एव राक्षसानां महाभयमुद्बभूव । यत्र यत्र तस्थतुर्वीतौ राघवौ तत्र तत्र निशाचरा बहु विलेपुः ।

(Because of that, great dread sprang up among the rākşasas. Wherever the two Rāghava heroes stood, there the rangers of the night (rākşasas) lamented greatly.)

तदनन्तरमन्यद्वनं जगाम रघुपतिः । तत्र च महातपस्तेपे सः । (Then the lord of the Raghus (Rāma) went to another forest. There he performed great austerities.)

17.18 Fre Continued: The Periphrastic Perfect

As mentioned at 17.6.c.i, roots of a certain phonological type do not form the ordinary reduplicated perfect. These are roots that have an initial vowel which is to either by nature (long or H ) or by position (preceding a conjunct consonant). Such roots are, in fact, relatively rare and of no great consequence. The form that they take that corresponds to the reduplicated foc, however, is of considerable interest because of its other * applications. This form is also called in by the grammarians. Western grammarians call it the periphrastic perfect. Like the periphrastic future (8C), it is made up of a fixed nominal and a

variable verbal form. 17.19 Formation of the Periphrastic Perfect

The formation of the periphrastic perfect is quite simple. The nominal element is formed by suffixing -3114 directly to the root. This form is then followed in the KE4C by the appro priate लिटof theroots अस्, Vकृ, or less often vy. In the आत्मनेपद, the auxiliary verb is the 31/64the form of vş only.

305

17.20

17.21

Thus, for example, for the roots V311A (2Ā), “sit,” and Veu (1A), "grow,” the प्रथम', एक', आत्मनेपद forms would be आसां चक्रे and एधां चक्रे. In theepic, Vआस् is sometimes taken as परस्मैपद, and so its foc form could be 31THATH, 3THER, or ca. The 9917°, CE, REAL would then be 3THIHNE: (-29, -:). The root V3114 is exempt from this formation (17.6.c.i.b). This form is also used instead of the reduplicated to for roots of the tenth 1. Here, however, the syllable -3714 is added, not to the root, but to the present stem. Examples: Root

Periphrastic perfect VERE (steal) Dehra (he stole)

चिन्त् (think) FarPHIE (he thought)

17.22 By this last technique (i.e., suffixation of -3114 to the present

stem) are formed the most significant occurrences of the peri phrastic fore, the perfects of the secondary conjugations. These

will be discussed in the following lesson. 17.23 The Perfect Participle

The se, like me and the 2c, has associated with it a verbal adjective. This one serves as a past active participle but is of extremely rare occurrence, being restricted in actual usage to a

very few verbal roots. 17.24

Its masculine stem is formed by adding the suffix -aid to the weak form of the perfect stem. Thus, Vops → paid. If this stem is monosyllabic, the ait is set off from the stem by the vowel 5 (but see a.): VETT → aferais (stood) Vay → alaih (heated) a. In fact, this form and its peculiar declension is of interest

mainly because a fairly common word, laat (learned or wise man), is, in form, a perfect participle. Like the finite for of the root viac, it loses both its reduplication and its past sense.
