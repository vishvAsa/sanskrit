3.1

Perhaps the most peculiar, and initially dismaying, feature of Sanskrit is its complex system of conditional phonological change known as U (sandhi), or combination. Various kinds of environmentally conditioned change occur in all languages, but no other has so formalized and systematized them as has

Sanskrit. There are two basic applications of the afu (sandhi) rules, depending on the circumstances under which the sound changes occur. Many of the same rules hold for both applications. The first historically and morphologically more significant appli cation applies to the junctures of the morphemes, or meaningful parts of words. This is called internal fu (sandhi). Less, perhaps, in historical significance, but of greater importance for the beginner, is the external Hiu (sandhi), which occurs at word boundaries and between members of compounds. With out familiarity with the rules of external HPU (sandhi), it is impossible to read or understand a Sanskrit sentence.

Therefore, while all HU (sandhi) changes are of interest, it is essential, at the outset, to learn the rules for external Hut (sandhi) and a few internal HU (sandhi) rules of common application. Let's examine the rules as they apply first to vowels and then to consonants. External Vowel Hau (sandhi) In general, the basic rule governing vowel amu (sandhi), in internal as well as external combination, is that two vowels should not come into direct contact. That is to say, except in a few cases (see 3.21), vowel hiatus is avoided. It is avoided by the collapse of the two juxtaposed vocalic syllables into one. This in turn may be accomplished in three ways: the coales cence of the two vowels into one, the change of the prior vowel

3.2

to a consonant, which then forms a single syllable with the

remaining vowel, or by the loss of one of the vowels. 3.3 Coalescence

The simplest kind of coalescence, or at any rate the easiest to remember, involves like vowels. Any two concurrent simple vowels of the same pair of long-short alterates (a, i, u, r), regardless of the length of either one, coalesce to form the long vowel of the set. Vowel length is not an issue, as any such sequence yields a long vowel.

Examples: 37 + 31 311; 7441 + HE + 3HITE + Hal 144 HEMTECHIATI a + a + ā; rāmeņa saha agacchat sītā rāmeņa sahāgacchat sītā.

31 + 371 → 31; 17701 + WE + 3M|Tela + Ftal → HENTER diten i a + ā ā; rāmeņa saha āgacchati sītā rāmeņa sahāgacchati sītā.

311 + 31 311; Fidell + 37110T +91971 HANDGATTI ā + a → ā; sītayā agacchat sumitrā sītayāgacchat sumitrā.

311 + 371 +371; Hell + 371e8fà + 274: Toula 27: 1 ātā →ā; sitayā āgacchati rāmaḥ sitayāgacchati rāmaḥ.

In the same way, any two concurrent"I" vowels, long or short, yield “7," and any two concurrent"u" vowels, long or short, yield “ū." Examples:

TO + sta + ata → orifa asta gacchāmi + iti + vadati → gacchāmīti vadati. (“I'm going," he says.)

976 +3714 → 9TH (supreme Kuru) kuru + uttama → kurūttama (supreme Kuru)

3.4

Coalescence may also occur as a result of the contact of two dissimilar vowels but only if the prior vowel is an "a" vowel (a or ā). Here again, the length of the two vowels is immaterial to the result.

25

Examples:

311 + $ → C; HEI + $07 → HERI ā + i +e; mahā + īsa — mahesa (great lord)

31 +3 → 317; (+ + 3G → CESTE a + u → o; lamba + udara lambodara (pot belly)

371 + # → 3R ; HET + #19 → HET ā +ị → ar, mahā + sși → maharși (great sage)

31 + 2; 39 + 9 + 3a a+e → ai; atra + eva → atraiva (right here)

31 + - €; TEU + taraft → Torfi a + ai → ai; gaccha + aišvaryam →gacchaiśvaryam. (Become a sovereign.) 311 + 317 → 31; H + 3116i vafa → Htaci gefa ā +0 → au; să + odanam pacati — saudanam pacati. (She cooks rice.)

31 + 371 → 3it; 4588 + 3t czek4 → YENİG=64 1 a +au → au; yaccha + audumbaram →yacchaudumbaram. (Give the udumbara fruit.)

3.5

Note that the complex vowels (ai) and 31 (au) may be re garded as the “long” form of the complex vowels (e) and 37 (o), respectively. Since length is the maximal grade, the coa lescence of 31 (a) with either the short or long form yields the long form. Vowel Strength Closely related to the results of the previous series of coalescences, although not identical, is a system of vowel grade or strength which is pervasive in Sanskrit and must be learned. The two grades of vowel strength are called Jul (guņa) and al (vrddhi). These grades are similar to the coalescence in

3.6

26

3.4, except that they distinguish vowel length of the strength ___ened "a" vowel. गुण (guna) increases the अ (a) vowel, as it

were, by short 31 (a), and area (vrddhi) by 311 (ā). गुण (guna) and वृद्धि (vrddhi) apply only to the simple vowels and are as follows: स्वर अ,आ svara a, ā i, i u, ū गुण अ,आ ए ओ अर् guna a,a

उ,ऊ

ār

3.8

वद्धि आ ऐ औ आर vrddhi ā

ai Note that the extremely common vowel 37 (a) (short) is un changed in lui (guna). This is sometimes expressed by the statement: अ (a) is its own गुण (guna).

This series of changes is extremely important, especially in internal HU (sandhi) processes of word derivation, and must be learned immediately and thoroughly. When two dissimilar vowels are juxtaposed and the first is not an "a" vowel (long or short), the syllabic coalescence is ef fected by changing the first vowel into its corresponding homorganic nonsyllabic semivowel. The correspondences are: इ/ई→ य् (i/i →y); 3/ऊ → व् (u/j →v); ऋ/ऋ → र् (r/r →r) Examples:

आगच्छामि + अहम् → आगच्छाम्यहम् । āgacchāmi + aham →āgacchāmy aham. (I am coming.)

3.9

जयतु + आर्यपुत्रः → जयत्वार्यपुत्रः । jayatu + aryaputrah → jayatv aryaputrah. (May my lord be

victorious.)

पितृ + ईप्सितम् → पित्रीप्सितम् pitr + ipsitam → pitr ipsitam (...desired by the father)

27

3.10

Complex Vowels The complex vowels, which are, as we can now see, vocalic sounds that may be analyzed into other vowel sounds, betray their complex form when juxtaposed with a vocalic sound (simple or complex). To understand this process, it is essential to have a clear idea of the structure of the complex vowels. Keep in mind that:

3.11

(e) is the joi (guņa) of 3/$ (i/i) and represents 37 + 3/$ (a + i/i) (ai) is the area (vrddhi) of 3/ (i/i) and represents 311 + 3/(ā + i/i)

(guna) of 3/31 (u/ū) and represents 37 + 3/3 (a + u/ū) 31 (au) is the ate (vrddhi) of 3/5 (u/ū) and represents 371 +3/5 (ā+u/ū)

31 (o) i

3.12

3.13

Now, when one of these four complex vowels occurs immedi ately before a vowel sound and is juxtaposed with it, two processes, as it were, take place: a) the complex vowel is analyzed into its components, and b) the final "i" or "u" element of that analysis is changed into

its corresponding semivowel. Clear examples from internal Hu (sandhi): a. The analysis of the word PC (jayatu—May he be victo

rious; 3.9, ex. 2) is as follows: The vowel of the verbal root to (ji-conquer, be victorious) is, for reasons to be learned later (see 7.14), subjected to Jul (guņa) in the for mation of the stem required here. Thus fh (ji je). When the < (e) is juxtaposed with the 37 (a) of the class marker, the following steps occur (although only the final result is evident):

+ 31 (31 + 3) + 31; (31 + 3) + 34 → 37 + 4 + 37 e+a → (a + i) + a; (a +i) + a + a + y +a

so: 5 + 37 + 5 514 + 37 + 3 → RE

je + a + tu → jay + a + tu → jayatu (see 7.14)

28

3.14

3.15

3.16

b. In the same way, the root (bhū—to be) in forming 95

(bhavatu—let it be), undergoes a parallel series of a (sandhi) changes: VU + → I; + 37 4 (31 + 3) + 31; bhū + guna → bho; bho + a bh(a + u) + a; VH + 37 + → Hall

bhav + a + tu → bhavatu This process, with regard to the complex vowels 377 (0) and 377 (au) is similar to that in external Hau (sandhi). Thus, the sequence 371 + a (ubhau + eva—both of them): 341 + 3 + 09 → 341 + 2 + 0 3H10a ubhā + u + eva → ubhā + v + eva → ubhāv eva Final 31 (o), except as the result of another HL (sandhi) operation (3.35), is not common in word-final position. This process is obscured in external Hau (sandhi) by the im portant additional rule that: the ? (y) element of the complex vowel(e) is lost before a word-initial vowel other than short 31 (a) (3.20), and, in the case of (ai), before any vowel. So, in the sequence faut + 5(svarge + indraḥ—Indra is in heaven), the result would be: Faul 55: (svarga indraḥ). The process might be depicted as follows: Ft + 5-5: (9) (Fopf + 3) + 5-5: → svarge + indraḥ → (1) (svarga +i) + indraḥ → (2) Eqof + I + 55: → (3) 9 → 0(8) Foot Sos (2) svarga + y + indraḥ → (3) y → Ø (4) svarga indraḥ

3.17

3.18

Also, in the sequence 1 + 37GGR (tasmai + adadāt-He gave to him), the process could be seen as:

H + 3TGGICI → (9) ET + 3 + 3TGGIL tasmai + adadāt → (1) tasmā + i + adadāt → (?) 6 + 4 + 3TEGIE → (3) 4 → Ø (8) 6H 3TGETEI (2) tasmā + y + adadāt → (3) y → Ø (4) tasmā adadāt29

3.19

Note that when vowel hiatus (the sequence of two vowels) occurs as a result of a H (sandhi) rule or series of Hu (sandhi) rules, it is permitted to remain. In other words, in the case of vowels, only one pass through the fu (sandhi) rules is valid. One must not subject the resultant hiatus to further HAU (sandhi). In the case where a final (e) immediately precedes a short 31 (a), the 5 (e) remains unchanged while the 37 (a), frequently unstable in initial position (3.35), is lost.

3.20

Thus:

a +37604 → segar te + abruvan → te 'bruvan (They said.)

भारतदेशे + अवसत् → भारतदेशे ऽवसत् bhāratadeśe + avasat → bhāratadeśe 'vasat. (He lived in In dia.)

3.21

E (Pragshya) Vowels Certain vowels in certain restricted environments are not sub ject to the above rules. They are called Fje (pragshya) vowels and are as follows: a. vowels 5, $ (i, i), 3, 5 (u, ū), and (e), when they serve as

dual endings (4.12, 27) b. the 5, (i,i) of the pronoun 37- (ami) (See 19.1.b) c. the vowels of particles or interjections Examples: & + Start + 3111934 → od 3118a: dve + kanye + āgacchataḥ ► dve kanye āgacchatah. (Two girls come.) हे + आर्यपुत्र → हे आर्यपुत्र he + āryaputra → he āryaputra (O my lord)

3.22

Initial and Final Positions Since external Appu (sandhi) applies, by definition, at the junc

tures of words, it is useful to have a set of terms that describe sounds that occur at these junctures, namely at the beginning and end of words. a. The terminology for sounds occurring at the beginning of

words is quite simple. Such sounds are called initial sounds

or are said to be in initial position. b. The situation for sounds that occur at the end of words is,

however, a little more complicated. This is so because sounds in this final position are liable to various kinds of change depending upon whether another sound (i.e., an initial sound of a following word) follows them, and, if one does, upon the nature of that sound. i. Therefore, when we refer to a sound that occurs at the

end of a word, regardless of what may or may not fol low it, we say that the sound is a word final or in

word final position. ii. When we refer to a word final sound that has no other

sound following it in a sentence, as at the end of a sentence, or a single word cited by itself, we say that

the sound is in absolute final position. iii. In addition, we will also have occasion to refer to cer

tain sounds that almost always change when they occur in word final position. Obviously such sounds will usually be represented in final position by other sounds. We will call the original sounds (which are important despite the fact that they rarely occur in final position)

original finals. Possible Absolute Finals Despite the large number of sounds in Sanskrit, only a surpris ingly small number can occur in absolute final position. This is important because, especially with regard to consonants, ex ternal au (sandhi) operations are performed on word-finals with the absolute final as the point of origin.

3.23

3.25

Vowels in Absolute Final Position Any of the vowels, long or short, simple or complex, may oc cur in absolute final position. Consonants in Absolute Final Position a. Non-palatal stops

Of the stops (FYRİ-s (sparśa-s) of the opf-s (varga-s) other than the palatal (104-tālavya), only the first (non-voiced, non-aspirated) of each of (varga) is possible in absolute final position, i.e., (k), (4), 7 (t), and 9 (p). If others of the series (with either or both of the features of voicing and aspiration) occur as original finals, they are replaced by the first of the series.

Examples: 3194 → 3194; JEG → Tera anuştubh → anuştup; suhțd → suhst

b.

Palatal stops Palatals cannot appear in absolute final position; original final a → (c→ k), → < or 2 (→ or k).

Examples: 01 01:1795 1792; fac15 → Facic vāc → vāk; bhișaj → bhișak; virāj virāt

c. Original Final"-a "(-s)

The most common of the consonantal original finals, "-" (-s), becomes fahrt (visarga)""(-ḥ) in absolute final posi

tion (see 3.26). d. Nasals

"-4" (-m) and “-T" (-n) are extremely common in abso lute final position but are subject to a number of important changes (see 3.46).

Original Final "-" (-r) Original final "-" (-1) becomes ":" (-h) and behaves in some environments like final"-T (-s) (see 3.40). Original Final Consonant Clusters Original final consonant clusters are reduced to the first consonant of the cluster. Example: गच्छन्त् → गच्छन् gacchant →gacchan

3.26

3.27

HP (Sandhi) of Original Final“-H" (-s) By far the most confusing aspect of nonvocalic Afu (sandhi) and the one most essential to grasp quickly and thoroughly concerns the phonological permutations of original final“-! (-s), which may be replaced with the postvocalic aspiration called fant (visarga) "." (h) or with the semivowel "T" (r). The treatment of this sound in the various final positions is a little complex. However, it is especially important to learn, as “- (-s) is among the most common original final sounds in the language.

Treatment of final faart (visarga) is, like almost everything in Sanskrit grammar, systematic and elegant and should cause little difficulty if learned as such. Treatment of original final“- (-s) varies broadly according to whether or not the "-" (-s) follows an "37' (a) vowel or a non-“31” (a) vowel. The treatment of the final"-T (-s) in each of these cases then further depends upon the consonant or vowel that follows; whether or not that sound is voiced or voiceless, and in the case of a voiceless consonant, the ai (var ga) to which it belongs. "-8" (-s) Following Any Vowel but 37(a) or 311 (ā) a. Original final"#"(-s) becomes fahi (visarga) in abso

lute final position.

3.28

3.29

33

Example: 3 → 370:

agnis → agnih (fire)

b.

Final “-T' (-s) before any voiced initial (i.e., any vowel or any voiced consonant) becomes "T(r). Examples: 311H + 59 → ufura agnis + iva → agnir iva (like fire)

विष्णोस् + आयुधम् → विणोरायुधम्

vişņos + āyudham → vişnor āyudham (Vişnu's weapon.)

fara + alla A + 317) Jaafar gatis + nāsti (na + asti) → gatir nāsti (no way)

a + oita et hares + gaus → harer gauḥ (Hari's cow)

There is no exception to this rule, but if the following ini tial voiced sound happens to be an "7 (r), then to avoid the sequence "IT," there is a further change whereby the first “T' (r), the result of the change "T' (s) → "T" (r), is lost, and in compensation the preceding vowel, if short, is lengthened. Example: 31f + tad → 31 + → 31 m) + T → agnis + rocate → agnir + rocate → agni (0) + rocate →

अग्री रोचते । agnī rocate (Fire shines.)

c. Original final“T(-s) before non-voiced initials again var

ies according to two categories of following initial. The categories are: i Stops (E427-s—sparsa-s) of the three aul-s (varga-s)

homorganic with the three non-voiced sibilants

34

(350H7-5—ūşman-s). The sibilants are "T' (6), "T" (s), and “T'(s), and they correspond to the palatal (also tālavya), retrof

- mūrdhanya), and dental (Freddantya) classes. Non-voiced stops (Furf-s— sparsa-s) of these qu-s (varga-s), then, are the following six: “I (c); “7” (ch); “C” (t); “” (th);

"I" (t); "q" (th). ii. All other non-voiced consonants (including the sibi

lants themselves). In the first case, original final "-" (-s) becomes the sibilant corresponding to the auf (varga) of the following initial. Examples: ERE + E + ferai haris + calati → hariś calati. (Hari goes.)

3.30

विष्णोस् + छाया - विष्णोश्छाया

vişņos + chāyā — vişnoś chāyā (Vişnu's shadow)

Bra + atan arifa → Recai caifa i haris + tīkām karoti → hariş tīkām karoti. (Hari writes a com mentary.)

ifra + 1201: → 31fettfie: 1 agnis + tīkṣṇaḥ → agnis tikṣṇaḥ (no change) (Fire is fierce.)

a. Of these six stops (E4R-5—sparsa-s) only“ (ca), “Z!

(cha), and “I” (ta) are really common in word-initial posi tion. Therefore, the most frequently encountered changes are "" "T' (s →ś) and "A" "T" (s ) (no change). Still, if one is aware of the correspondences here, the

changes are easy to master. Original final "-" (-s) before all other non-voiced word-ini tial phonemes is changed to faret (visarga).

3.31

35

Examples: ERA + y4fa → Re: gerai haris + paśyati → hariḥ paśyati. (Hari sees.)

ERA + ata → ER: alai haris + khanati harih khanati. (Hari digs.)

3.32

Original Final "U" (s) after "31"' (a) Vowels The changes of final "T" (s) after “38' (a) and "3" (ā) are peculiar in several ways, and, since the morphological end ings"-37% (-as) and “-31T' (-ās) are of extremely common occurrence, it is important to learn the forms these endings take before the various kinds of word-initial phonemes. Original final “T(s) after “31”' (a) and “31” (ā) behaves in the same way as original final “T” (s) after other vowels in abso lute final position and before non-voiced initials. Examples: (146[+ 44f 74: fai rāmas + paśyati → rāmaḥ paśyati. (Rāma sees.)

3.33

2744 + Htai + gefa 274: Hai perai rāmas + sītām paśyati rāmahsītām paśyati. (Rāma sees Sītā.)

2744 + → 1990 rāmas + calati → rāmaś calati. (Rāma goes.)

3.34

3.35

Original final “-37'(-as) before voiced initials undergoes one of two transformations depending upon whether the initial is a. any voiced consonant or the vowel (short) "31"' (a), or b. any vowel other than (short) "31" (a). Before voiced consonants or a short “31” (a), original final "-37" (-as) changes to "-37" (-o), while a following initial short “31” (a) is, additionally, lost. Examples: 2742 + Jerufa → 27 Teuta i rāmas + gacchati → rāmo gacchati. (Rāma goes.)

36

24HH + IEL: Isl: paśyatas + rājñaḥ paśyato rājñaḥ

(While the king watches ...)

21441 + 3714 → TH 141 rāmas + ayam → rāmo 'yam. (He is Rāma.)

पश्यतस् + अर्जुनस्य → पश्यतो ऽर्जुनस्य paśyatas + arjunasya → paśyato 'rjunasya

(While Arjuna watches ...)

3.36

Before any vowel but short"31" (a), original final “-3772" (-as) becomes "31" (a), and the vowel hiatus remains unchanged. Examples: 2144 + 394 → 314 399 rāmas + uvāca → rāma uvāca (Rāma said.)

बुद्धस् + इव विद्यया → बुद्ध इव विद्यया buddhas + iva vidyayā → buddha iva vidyayā (like the

Buddha in wisdom)

3.37

3.38

One further restriction on the conditioning of original final "-3761" (-as) needs to be memorized. This is a restriction not only with regard to phonological environment but a restriction to two specific lexical items. Original final “-37T' (-as), when it ends either of the common nominative singular masculine pronouns ":" (sah) or "24:" (eşah)(see 5.5), becomes “31” (a) before any consonant, voiced or unvoiced. Examples: HCl + court → out: 1 sas + kļşņas → sa kṛṣṇaḥ. (He is Kļşņa.)

246 ++31f1 → 99 34 stari eşas + śukas + asti eșa śuko 'sti. (That is a parrot.)

37

3.39

The treatment of original final "317['(-ās) is quite simple: “317[' (-ās) becomes "3T' (-ā) before any voiced word-initial (vowel or consonant) without exception. Examples: हतास् वीरास् गच्छन्ति स्वर्गलोकम् → hatās vīrās gacchanti svargalokam →

हता वीरा गच्छन्ति स्वर्गलोकम् । hatā vīrā gacchanti svargalokam. (Slain heroes go to heaven.)

3.40

Original Final "-37" (car) In addition to the very common original final "-37' (-as), there occur, in only a very few words, instances of original final "-37' (-ar). Original final"-37' (ar) before non-voiced con sonants and in absolute final position behaves like final "-3761"(-as) (see 3.29.c). Before voiced sounds, except" (-r), it remains. Don't forget, Sanskrit does not allow the con sonantal sequence (rr) (3.29.b). a. There are a few instances in the language where

final"- (-1) is preceded by a vowel other than "31" (a). The rules for these are the same as those for

"-37' (-ar). b. Final"-37' (-ar) should not be confused with "-372/"

(-as) despite the fact that 1) original final “T' (s) (only after a non"39" (a) vowel) becomes “T" (r) before an initial voiced sound and 2) original final “-3R' (-ar) becomes"-37" (-aḥ), "-37" (-as), "-374"' (-as), or "-37" (-as), in the same environments as does origi

nal final"-375" (-as). REMEMBER: Before voiced initials, original finals"-37' ( as) and “3114' (-ās) never become“-37' (car) and"-37"' (-ār), while original final "-37" (ar) never becomes “-371"(-o). Original final “-3? (-ar) is virtually restricted to the two ad verbs 9 (punar—again), and ICT (prātar-in the morning).

38

Learn these words with the original final"-"(-1) so as to avoid confusion. Examples: EFR +977 +99:97: punar + punar → punaḥ punaḥ (again and again),

but JAR + GPRS + GU19A + fa → 99: gachtaire

punar +punar +dānavān +hanti → punaḥ punar dānavān hanti (Again and again he kills the demons.)

3.41

SO

प्रातर् + आगमिष्यति → प्रातरागमिष्यति prātar + āgamișyati → prātar āgamișyati (He will come in the morning.) General Principles of Consonant HP (Sandhi)

Just as the avoidance of vowel hiatus serves as a general prin ciple of vowel HPU (sandhi), so an overriding principle of much consonantal Hea (sandhi) is the avoidance, to a great extent, of the contact of markedly dissimilar consonants. Such contact, where it occurs, is often mitigated by the alteration of at least one feature of one or sometimes both of the juxtaposed sounds. Assimilation in External Hfa (Sandhi) of Final F427 (Sparśa) Sounds The alteration of one or more features of a sound to make it more like another sound is known as assimilation. When a sound assimilates to a following sound, the assimilation is said to be regressive. When a sound assimilates to a preceding sound, the assimilation is said to be progressive. External consonant Hmu (sandhi) generally involves assimilation with respect to the feature of voicing. The assimilation is generally regressive. In general, a non-voiced final Furf (sparsa) of any of (varga) becomes the voiced (non-aspirate) of the same aof (varga) before a voiced initial (EQR—svara or 49514—vyañjana). In general, such finals are unchanged before non-voiced initials.

3.4339

Examples: Solar + hafa + HE: → pengara HHTE: 1 krodhāt + bhavati + sammohaḥ → krodhād bhavati sammohaḥ. (Confusion comes from anger.)

31-TC + 371 → BRIGE: 1 āsit + asuraḥ → āsid asuraḥ. (There was a demon.) HHTEIA + faraya: → Hektarat: sammohāt + smộtivibhramah → sammohāt smộtivibhramah. (Loss of memory arises from confusion.)

3.44

A very important exception is that final "T" (-t), when it pre cedes an initial frí (sparśa) of the palatal class (alattālavya or“ -ca al-varga) or retroflex class ( mūrdhanya or “Z”?— ța cof-varga) becomes a de-aspirated FYRf (sparśa) of the same class as the initial and is voiced or non-voiced just as in 3.43. Examples: Ja + felcstela → afectatai tat + cikīrsati → tac cikīrsati. (He wants to do that.) dal + Stella Stella i tat + jahāti → tajjahāti. (He abandons that.)

3.45

An important corollary of this requires special attention. Final "T (-t), when it precedes initial “-T (-s), (the palatal sibi lant), becomes "" (c) and the following “T' () becomes "" (ch). Examples: F + cal + 974 +37499 + fra: → tat + śrutvā + kupitas + abhavat + śivah → तच्छ्रुत्वा कुपितो भवच्छिवः । tac chrutvā kupito 'bhavac chivah (Upon hearing that, Siva became enraged.)

External Afu (Sandhi) of Nasals Nasals, whether the first or second of a pair of juxtaposed con sonants, constitute exceptions to the above rule in that such consonant contacts generally entail more thorough assimila tion than in the case of non-nasal contacts. In external consonant contact involving a nasal, assimilation may affect not only the voicing of a test (sparśa) but also its mode and even the point of articulation (oral/nasal and qui—varga). Thus, any word-final stop before a word-initial nasal becomes the nasal of its proper aut (varga). Examples:

acl + H1 + ga → etat + mā + kuru —etan mā kuru. (Don't do that!)

9102 +424 → 915:44: vāk + mayaḥ → vāñmayah (consisting of speech) H (Sandhi) of Absolute Final Nasals Absolute final nasals are subject to a number of rules of vary ing importance for the beginner. By far the most important and most commonly invoked rule concerns absolute final"- " (-m), one of the most frequent finals in the language. Final "-" (-m) becomes 37Jfar (anusvāra) "" " (-m) before any following initial consonant (voiced or unvoiced). Examples: 1746 + 0.+ Tesla → TH Taula rāmas + vanam + gacchati → rāmo vanam gacchati. (Rāma goes to the forest.)

va

791414 + gt44 + gota → #fun gatos cota i sșīņām + pustakam + pațhati > ļķīņām pustakam pațhati. (He reads the sages' book.)

There are no exceptions to this rule.

Treatment of Absolute Final "-7" (-n) “-T' (-n), also a common final, is the subject of the following changes. Final “-I' (-n) before a non-voiced stop (E431-sparśa) of the three “sibilant" qui-s (vargas -s) (see 3.29.c) becomes 3769R (anusvāra) “'" (m). In addition, the sibilant homorganic with the following initial is inserted between the new final (m) and the initial. Examples: or + FL + TR + 374 + 27511 →

kasmin + cit + nagare + avasat + rājā →

कस्मिंश्चिन्नगरे ऽवसद्राजा । kasmimś cin nagare 'vasad rājā. (The king lived in a city.)

3.52

मूर्खान् + त्यजति + पण्डितः → मूल्स्त्य जति पण्डितः । mūrkhān + tyajati + panditaḥ → mūrkhāms tyajati panditaḥ. (A wise man leaves fools alone.) Final"-T (-n) before a voiced initial of the docu (tālavya) or TERE (mūrdhanya) apf-s (varga-s) becomes the nasal of the dof (varga) in question. Example: GA0G + Ref +576 → Hoeding: dānavān + jayati + indraḥ ► dānavāñ jayatīndraḥ. (Indra conquers the demons.)

3.53

Final “-T (-n) before initial “T' (s) becomes “ST (ñ), and the "T' (s) becomes "T" (ch) (cf. 3.45). Example: Ayer + 310419 + yunta YBEOGuilla i madhurān + sabdan + śmmoti madhurāñ chabdāñ chrmoti. (He hears sweet sounds.)

3.54

Final"-T' (-n) before initial" (1) becomes " "(m) (3174R anusvāra), and an additional "" (1) is inserted before the original one.

42

Example: 3746 + 9 + + : → uttamān + lokān + labhate + dharmajñaḥ →

उत्तमाल्ँलोकाल्ँलभते धर्मज्ञः । uttamāml lokāml labhate dharmajñaḥ. (A knower of dharma attains to excellent worlds.)

3.55

Final "E" (-ñ), "" (-n), and "T' (-n) are written as doubled when they occur after a short vowel and precede any initial vowel. Examples: स्तुवन् + आगच्छति → स्तुवन्नागच्छति । stuvan + āgacchati → stuvann āgacchati (He comes praising.)

6 + 50 → Battal hasan + iva → hasann iva (as though laughing)

3.56

Initial “7' (h) after a final Furf (sparśa) becomes the voiced aspirated 7431 (sparśa) of the auf (varga) of the preceding final. Example: CEL + <<fà + : → Geta EIR: 1 etat + harati + cauraḥ → etad (3.43) dharati caurah. (The thief carries that away.)

419 + P + caal aa aaa vāk + hi + devatā — vāgghi devatā. (For speech is a divinity.)

Internal Hau (Sandhi) Most of the above rules apply to external HIRU (sandhi) situa tions. Some, especially those concerning vowel Hau (sandhi) are applicable to internal HRU (sandhi) as well. In the case of consonantal afu (sandhi), however, the rules for external and

43

internal Afu (sandhi) often differ considerably. Internal HD (sandhi) rules are complex and, moreover, in order to be prop erly understood, depend upon knowledge of a great variety of different morphological units and processes. Therefore, it is better to leave discussion of most particular internal Hu (san dhi) rules for consonants to be dealt with as they arise in our survey of the various grammatical categories and forms of Sanskrit. Before proceeding to that survey, however, we may consider two simple but important and very common internal

PU (sandhi) changes. These are the changes of the Copy 3046 (dantya üşman) “H” (s) and nasal “T' (n) to the fa 3047 (mūrdhanya ūşman) "T" (s) and nasal “T (n), respectively. The dental 3,044 (üşman)“T' (s)—if not in word final position or followed by the 3R:R4 (antahstha) "*" (r)—is changed to "7" (s) if immediately preceded in a word by any vowel other than the "31' (a) vowels or by the consonants "a" (k) or "7" (r). Examples: Hista (sidati-he sits), but fasista (vișidati-he sinks down)

3.58

- (-su—locative plural ending): dung (kanyāsu—among maidens), but cag (deveșu—among gods) -P (-si—second person singular ending): 31PH (atsi—you eat),

(bhunakși—you eat)

A

-R1 (-sya-future tense marker): Gleita (dāsyati—he will give), but Han (bhavisyati—he will be)

3.59

If the Grey (dantya) nasal"?”(n) is preceded in a word by the ART 3,647 (mūrdhanya ūşman) "T" (), the 3R:24 (antaḥstha) "T" (r), or the vowels "F" (?) or "F" (), and if no doce (tālavya), 7(mūrdhanya), or Grey (dantya) consonant (ex cept the amou 3R:F99 (tālavya antaḥstha) "T' [y]) intervenes between the two, then the "7" (n) is changed to "UT' (n) if it is immediately followed by a vowel, semivowel, or nasal.

44

3.60

This alarmino This alarmingly conditional rule may seem to be a bit complex for such a seemingly minor change, and perhaps it is. Still, since the change is quite common, it is necessary to know the rule in order to spell many words correctly. For the moment, it will suffice to remember that “T' (n) when preceded by “T'(r), "T" (s), or “*” (r) is retroflexed in many environments and that the change, therefore, is a common one. Examples: 214 (rāma) + (ena-instrumental singular ending) → <140 (rāmeņa—by Rāma)

EF (brahman—the Absolute) + 371 (ā-instrumental singu lar ending) → FEM (brahmaņā—by the Absolute)

3.61

The operation of these two rules (3.59 and 3.60), in fact, ac counts for the great majority of the occurrences of the sounds "T" (s) and "UT' (n) in Sanskrit.
