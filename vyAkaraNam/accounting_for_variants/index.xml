      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;tilaks-observation&#34;&gt;Tilak&amp;rsquo;s observation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I may, however, remark that the process which appears so simple according to the modern philological rules, was not recognized by the native grammarians. There are good many words in Sanskrit which can be thus easily derived on the principle of the insertion and omission of h.+++(5)+++ Thus we have invakā and hinvakā both meaning the stars on the top of Mrigashiras, and aṭṭa and haṭṭa denoting a marketplace. But native grammarians, including Pāṇini, would not derive the words from each other, as we have done above in the case of ayana and hayana. Their method is to give two different roots for the two words, thus we have two Vedic roots hinva and inva or hiv and iv, both meaning to go, to please, the one giving us hinvaka and the other invaka. Aṭ and haṭ, an and han, ay and hay, i and hi are further instances of the principle adopted by the native grammarians in such cases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
